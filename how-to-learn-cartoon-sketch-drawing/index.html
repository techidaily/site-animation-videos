<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg"
                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg"
                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-Adobe-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-Adobe-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?</strong></h2><p>Alright, so what is the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong> and how does it differ from <strong>Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging</strong> or <strong>Adobe After Effects Rigging</strong>? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX"><a href="#05IKMAX" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-1"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-Adobe-Auto-Rigger-3"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-Adobe-Auto-Rigger-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?</strong></h2><p>Alright, so what is the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong> and how does it differ from <strong>Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging</strong> or <strong>Adobe After Effects Rigging</strong>? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-3"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>
<p><img

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>
<p><img

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-3"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-3"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-3" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro-3"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-3"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-3" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-3"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-3" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX-3"><a href="#05IKMAX-3" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>
