Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Timeline Positioning of Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Reach to the ‘File’ menu and choose ‘Preferences’ from the latter’s dropdown menu. In the ‘Preferences’ window, hit the ‘Editing’ tab and tap on ‘Photo Preferences’. From the drop down menu that follows, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option to adjust the aspect ratio of your imported images in line with the slideshow project. In case your images have the 9:16 vertical aspect ratio, select the ‘Fit’ option to make a proper screen fit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Using the ‘Crop to Fit’ Tool"
                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to include the image zoom and camera pan features within your project by clicking on the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option. You can further, modify the preset durations of transitions, effects and photos in the ‘Editing’ tab itself before adding them to the editor timeline. Another way of doing the same is to drag the ends of the media files inward or outward, post the timeline adding process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-18.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Effect Play Duration Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p>When you have finished making the required adjustments, navigate back the ‘Media Panel’ to include the imported media files within the project timeline. You can either click on the files to add them, or choose to ‘Drag and Drop’ the same at a preferred place within the timeline.</p>
<p>When all the images and videos have been added, proceed to arrange them in the desired order of appearance in the slideshow, followed by adjusting their screen time and play durations through any of the methods explained above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-19.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Slide Transitions"
                ></p>
<p>Post the timeline adding of a transition, you can double click on the same to reach the ‘Transition Setting Window’, where you are allowed to customize the play duration and select its ‘Transition Mode’. Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Overlays and Filters for an Improvised Colour Scheme</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Filters and Overlays"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Include Motion Graphic Elements</strong></p>
<p>To supplement your slideshow with elegant motion graphics, navigate to the ‘Elements’ tab in the editor timeline. From here, you can access and choose any suitable motion graphic template from a diversity of available choices, to include within the project timeline. The step is completely optional and you should pay attention to the style of content presentation and the cause of creation of your slideshow when choosing to add these elements to the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Including Motion Graphic Elements"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Record Voiceovers and Create Soundtracks</strong></p>
<p>To record a voiceover for your slideshow, navigate to the ‘Media’ tab and tap the ‘Record’ dropdown menu. Click on ‘Record Voiceover’ in the list of options that appears. The ‘Record Audio’ icon pops up and you now need to select a microphone to be used in the recording process. When you are ready, tap the ‘Record’ button to let the recording begin.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Voiceover Recording"
                ></p>
<p>You can now see your voice recording appear in the ‘Media’ tab with the previously imported media files, ready to be placed within the audio track of the project timeline. Filmora’s audio library is a storehouse of free access music and audio effects. To add one to your slideshow, navigate and click on the ‘Audio’ tab to select from the extensive Rock, Young &amp; Bright, Electronic, etc., music subcategories till you get the perfect match for your presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-23.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Soundtracks"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the music tracks, place them one by one on the project timeline and move ahead with adjusting their play durations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Export Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>When you are satisfied with your work, you can export the slideshow directly from Filmora to a number of media sharing platforms. All you need to do is, navigate to and tap the ‘Export’ button in the top right corner of the editor screen and proceed to set the resolution and frame rate, and select the output file format of your created slideshow in the ‘Export Window’ that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-24.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Slideshow Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready with everything, click on the ‘Export’ button at the bottom right corner of the screen to share your slideshow across different platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, Vimeo, etc.</p>
<p>The time required by Filmora to render your slideshow on the chosen platform will depend on the output file size. Considering the fact that larger files require a much longer time to be rendered, it would be a smart decision to limit the file size of your slideshow within 500 MB.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame.

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 04"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 04"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
