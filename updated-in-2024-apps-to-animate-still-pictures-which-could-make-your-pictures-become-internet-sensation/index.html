These days you can do whatever you want online so animating still pictures should be a piece of cake if you know-how.</p>
<p>A video is basically an entire collage of moving pictures. So if you can cut out pictures from a video why not turn still pictures into animations.</p>
<p><strong>There are a number of ways you can use to animate still images →</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Videos are multiple pictures that move at a frame rate. Make short copies of a video by cutting out the essential moments and playing them in a loop.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add and play video animation elements over a picture. With the right software, this task is as easy as copy-pasting over another image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply an animated 3D image with a transparent background over another image. Remember, the bigger the element the closer it is. So size is directly translated as distance.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can use multiple filters and effects on an image with an <strong>animated portrait app</strong>. Find out what app you can use further on in this article.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Turn an image into a GIF. No matter its small size and cartoonish style, GIF animation has a very wide appeal as online content.</p>

<p>A video is basically an entire collage of moving pictures. So if you can cut out pictures from a video why not turn still pictures into animations.</p>
<p><strong>There are a number of ways you can use to animate still images →</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Videos are multiple pictures that move at a frame rate. Make short copies of a video by cutting out the essential moments and playing them in a loop.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add and play video animation elements over a picture. With the right software, this task is as easy as copy-pasting over another image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply an animated 3D image with a transparent background over another image. Remember, the bigger the element the closer it is. So size is directly translated as distance.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can use multiple filters and effects on an image with an <strong>animated portrait app</strong>. Find out what app you can use further on in this article.</p>

Script is the Essence"></a>1. Script is the Essence</h4><p>If you wish to understand the nuances of how to make an animation, the first step you should know is scripting.</p>
<p>Playing with the words in your mind and weaving them on paper makes a big difference. So, penning a story helps you to recognize the loopholes, the pace, and the character development in your story.</p>
<p>The script gives a person an idea of where your story is based, how does it look or at which time of the day are you talking about, who is talking to whom, and most importantly, the dialogues, what are your story characters say to one another. The script is the essence of creating animation and without it, you cannot resume the process of animation.</p>

<h4 id="2-Storyboarding"><a href="#2-Storyboarding" class="headerlink" title="2. Storyboarding"></a>2. Storyboarding</h4><p>What is storyboarding? It is a sequence of images or pre-visualization of movie shots to understand how exactly the story will unveil, the feel, the look, the camera angles, everything is described like a flowchart.</p>
<p>Storyboarding can be of various types. It may be colorful, it may just an outline, or black and white or something with complete detail. A storyboard must give a complete and close image of what the movie would look like.</p>
<p>The images must be captioned, the movement of the camera must be shown with arrows, and the object and characters must be differentiated from the background with colors.</p>

<h4 id="3-Voiceover"><a href="#3-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="3. Voiceover"></a>3. Voiceover</h4><p>If you want to make your animation more vivid and interesting, remember to add voiceover. Would you like to see an animated movie without a voice? It is a vital part of any movie recording.</p>
<p>When you ask how to make an animation, you also need to know how to record a voiceover. The animation is influenced by voice performance for focus and timing of a scene. The animated scene and the voiceover must be in sync perfectly in order to retain the attention of the viewers.</p>

So, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >pick up a 2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to animate your characters.
