Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-2"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-2" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures.

Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.</p>
<h3 id="05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional-2"><a href="#05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional-2" class="headerlink" title="05Marketing To Medical Professional"></a>05Marketing To Medical Professional</h3><p>While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background.

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool"><a href="#01Brush-Tool" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool"><a href="#03Pen-Tool" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-1"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-1"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-1" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-1"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-2"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-2"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-2" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-2"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-3"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-3"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-3" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-3"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>

It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

This software is highly-rated online and it comes with a bunch of presets, filters, and effects, that you can use in order to animate your photographs.

<p>When it comes to <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

You’ll be given a choice in what kind of animations you want to put on your photograph thereafter. And, when the conversion is complete, it’ll be FREE to download and share.</p>

But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>
