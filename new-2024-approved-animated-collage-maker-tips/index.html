<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-GIF-Illustration"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-GIF-Illustration" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?"></a>Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?</h2><p>GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.</p>
<p>Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.</p>
<p>These are now used as everything from advertisements to commentary from all walks of life. The users of GIFs seem to be endless! They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Best-12-Illusion-Gifs"><a href="#Part-2-Best-12-Illusion-Gifs" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs"></a>Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs</h2><p>This curated list will help you to know the best <strong>Illusion GIF</strong> that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-</p>
<h3 id="01Van-Gogh-Stare-GIF"><a href="#01Van-Gogh-Stare-GIF" class="headerlink" title="01Van Gogh Stare GIF"></a>01Van Gogh Stare GIF</h3><p>The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the “dazzle camouflage,” is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye’s instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/9tXAXIgFsKyuotYjDh" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02This-brain-busting-rotation"><a href="#02This-brain-busting-rotation" class="headerlink" title="02This brain-busting rotation"></a>02This brain-busting rotation</h3><p>We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can’t see it from every angle.</p>
<h3 id="03This-loop-tea-GIF"><a href="#03This-loop-tea-GIF" class="headerlink" title="03This loop tea GIF"></a>03This loop tea GIF</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn’t make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/meme-image-know-K79kKDx86GMik" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="04No-smkoing-Well-you-should-never"><a href="#04No-smkoing-Well-you-should-never" class="headerlink" title="04No smkoing! Well, you should never"></a>04No smkoing! Well, you should never</h3><p>The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you’ll notice that there’s actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it’s not really a head either - it’s just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.</p>
<p>The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren’t always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are</p>
<h3 id="05The-never-ending-corridor"><a href="#05The-never-ending-corridor" class="headerlink" title="05The never-ending corridor"></a>05The never-ending corridor</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.</p>
<p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can’t process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.</p>
<h3 id="06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser"><a href="#06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser" class="headerlink" title="06Now, this, the eye-pleaser"></a>06Now, this, the eye-pleaser</h3><p>The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there’s only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="07Commercial-At-design-GIF"><a href="#07Commercial-At-design-GIF" class="headerlink" title="07Commercial At design GIF"></a>07Commercial At design GIF</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="08Wait-what-Is-this-truly-a-reflection"><a href="#08Wait-what-Is-this-truly-a-reflection" class="headerlink" title="08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?"></a>08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?</h3><p>This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what’s really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it’s just inverted.</p>
<h3 id="09This-haunting-tableau-Not-exactly-a-GIF-but-worth-sharing"><a href="#09This-haunting-tableau-Not-exactly-a-GIF-but-worth-sharing" class="headerlink" title="09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)"></a>09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.</p>
<h3 id="10This-safety-hazard"><a href="#10This-safety-hazard" class="headerlink" title="10This safety hazard"></a>10This safety hazard</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="11Welcome-to-the-3d-World"><a href="#11Welcome-to-the-3d-World" class="headerlink" title="11Welcome to the 3d World"></a>11Welcome to the 3d World</h3><p>It’s an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.</p>

<h3 id="12I-will-keep-this-table-forever"><a href="#12I-will-keep-this-table-forever" class="headerlink" title="12I will keep this table forever"></a>12I will keep this table forever</h3><p>The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.</p>

Is this truly a reflection?</h3><p>This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what’s really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it’s just inverted.</p>

The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.</p>

When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.</p>

The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.</p>

It was likely intended to represent the eye’s instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.</p>

But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can’t see it from every angle.</p>
<h3 id="03This-loop-tea-GIF-2"><a href="#03This-loop-tea-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="03This loop tea GIF"></a>03This loop tea GIF</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn’t make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.</p>

Well, you should never</h3><p>The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you’ll notice that there’s actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it’s not really a head either - it’s just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.</p>
<p>The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren’t always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are</p>
<h3 id="05The-never-ending-corridor-2"><a href="#05The-never-ending-corridor-2" class="headerlink" title="05The never-ending corridor"></a>05The never-ending corridor</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.</p>
<p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can’t process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.</p>
<h3 id="06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser-2"><a href="#06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser-2" class="headerlink" title="06Now, this, the eye-pleaser"></a>06Now, this, the eye-pleaser</h3><p>The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there’s only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.</p>

<h3 id="07Commercial-At-design-GIF-2"><a href="#07Commercial-At-design-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="07Commercial At design GIF"></a>07Commercial At design GIF</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.</p>

<p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can’t process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.</p>
<h3 id="06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser-3"><a href="#06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser-3" class="headerlink" title="06Now, this, the eye-pleaser"></a>06Now, this, the eye-pleaser</h3><p>The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there’s only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.</p>

<h3 id="07Commercial-At-design-GIF-3"><a href="#07Commercial-At-design-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="07Commercial At design GIF"></a>07Commercial At design GIF</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.</p>

Is this truly a reflection?</h3><p>This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what’s really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it’s just inverted.</p>
<h3 id="09This-haunting-tableau-Not-exactly-a-GIF-but-worth-sharing-3"><a href="#09This-haunting-tableau-Not-exactly-a-GIF-but-worth-sharing-3" class="headerlink" title="09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)"></a>09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.</p>
<h3 id="10This-safety-hazard-3"><a href="#10This-safety-hazard-3" class="headerlink" title="10This safety hazard"></a>10This safety hazard</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.</p>

The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.</p>

The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.</p>

<h2 id="Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？"><a href="#Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？" class="headerlink" title="Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？"></a>Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？</h2><p>What makes anime boys so attractive is their gentle demeanor. Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an <strong>anime boy</strong> is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.</p>
<p>Also, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese don’t desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, <strong>a male anime character</strong> is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!</p>

<h2 id="Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-1"><a href="#Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？"></a>Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？</h2><p>What makes anime boys so attractive is their gentle demeanor. Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an <strong>anime boy</strong> is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.</p>
<p>Also, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese don’t desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, <strong>a male anime character</strong> is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!</p>

<h2 id="Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-2"><a href="#Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？"></a>Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？</h2><p>What makes anime boys so attractive is their gentle demeanor. Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an <strong>anime boy</strong> is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.</p>
<p>Also, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese don’t desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, <strong>a male anime character</strong> is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!</p>

<p>Ayato Sakamaki belongs to the Sakamaki household and is the third son of the Vampire king Karlheinz and his wife Cordelia. Ayato is an angry young man with a slender body and rough reddish-colored spiky hair. He has a fair complexion and narrow green eyes. Ayato is a troublesome character yearning for attention. He is presented as a mischievous and clever young boy who looks down on others. By nature, he is a bully and teases people for his personal pleasure. Ayato refers to himself as “Ore-sama” (Yours Truly) after he falls in love with Chichinashi. Fans love him because he is a narcissist who is mercilessly passionate about torture – exactly what a real vampire should be!</p>
<h2 id="Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-3"><a href="#Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？"></a>Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？</h2><p>What makes anime boys so attractive is their gentle demeanor. Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an <strong>anime boy</strong> is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.</p>
<p>Also, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese don’t desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, <strong>a male anime character</strong> is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!</p>

<p>When it comes to <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>

<p>With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools. This one works quite simply as well though. Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a cartoon version of your images easily and quickly.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>
