<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg"
                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="animations in unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.</p>

Why? Because Unity is more suitable for animating objects for games. Not to mention, Unity has a steep learning curve and if you are not an experienced Unity developer, you may fail to create a 2D animation properly.</p>
<p>So, if you only need a 2D animation for videos, we have a better alternative for the job. Instead of Unity, you can use <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.

<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>

<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-15"><a href="#In-this-article-15" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
