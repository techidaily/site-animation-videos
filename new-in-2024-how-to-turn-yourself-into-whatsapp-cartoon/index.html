<p>Let me ask you a question - how much fun would it be if you could create your own animated stickers and send them to your friends and family members on Whatsapp? I mean, it would make the entire conversation more fun and also add a personal element to the entire chat. Right? Well, to tell you the truth, it is possible to create <strong>Whatsapp cartoons</strong> and stickers, and the best part is you don’t need any technical expertise to get the job done.</p>
<p>Of course, for a long time, Whatsapp didn’t allow its users to use third-party animated stickers within the messenger. But, recently the messaging platform introduced a custom “stickers pack” feature that now allows people to upload their own stickers and create a dedicated sticker app.</p>
<p>You can also rely on several third-party sticker designer applications to get the job done. So, if you have been looking for a way to use your own face as an animated sticker in Whatsapp, continue reading. In this guide, we’ll walk you through different ways to create and upload a custom cartoon sticker in Whatsapp and make your Whatsapp chats more fun.</p>

There’s no AR feature that’ll turn your face into a cartoon character. So, to use a <strong>cartoon Whatsapp profile picture</strong>, you’ll have to rely on a third-party tool to get the job done. Based on which platform you use to access Whatsapp, you can choose a wide variety of Whatsapp animated sticker creators and use them to design custom cartoon stickers to make traditional Whatsapp conversations more fun.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to create custom stickers for Whatsapp is to use Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.

<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Give the sticker pack a name and then, press enter to proceed further.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> At this point, you can either select one of the existing pictures from your Gallery or open the camera to click a fresh selfie. Either way, upload the picture and let the app convert it into a corresponding sticker.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> You can upload 8-10 pictures at once and create the entire sticker pack instantly. And, once you have successfully created the sticker pack, simply click the “Add to Whatsapp” button.</p>

<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies. Although, DC remains the king regards to animated movies. DC animated movies are better coordinated with live-action scenes. Each story features different aspects of Gotham city and its issues.</p>
<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.</p>

<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.</p>

<p>If what you’re searching for is a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-16"><a href="#In-this-article-16" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs"><a href="#Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs"></a>Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs</h2><p>First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools and <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>The first <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.</p>
<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Launch Filmora Video Editor"></a>01Step 1: Launch <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>First things first, launch the <strong>3D GIF maker</strong> that you intend to use.

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>
<p>And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.</p>

And, these days, it’s easier than ever to create them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are 3D GIF Makers available everywhere online. Each one is a little different, of course. But capable of allowing you to create GIFs with images and videos that you can eventually share.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One such example is the <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, Filmora. It was the first one that we introduced on our list of the best 3D GIf Makers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> We also included a tutorial on how you can use Filmora as a <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> for your reference. You can try out the program today if you like. Wondershare offers a FREE trial that you can use in order to explore the many functions of the software before you commit to buying out the perpetual license or signing up for one of their subscription packages.</p>

<p>If what you’re searching for is a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.</p>

We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools and <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>The first <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.</p>
<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop-1"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop-1" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>

With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media &gt; Import Media File.

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>

And, these days, it’s easier than ever to create them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are 3D GIF Makers available everywhere online. Each one is a little different, of course. But capable of allowing you to create GIFs with images and videos that you can eventually share.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One such example is the <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, Filmora. It was the first one that we introduced on our list of the best 3D GIf Makers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> We also included a tutorial on how you can use Filmora as a <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> for your reference. You can try out the program today if you like. Wondershare offers a FREE trial that you can use in order to explore the many functions of the software before you commit to buying out the perpetual license or signing up for one of their subscription packages.</p>

<p>If what you’re searching for is a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-19"><a href="#In-this-article-19" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Create 3D animated GIFs online with Filmora](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs-3"><a href="#Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs"></a>Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs</h2><p>First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools and <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>The first <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.</p>
<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop-3"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Launch Filmora Video Editor"></a>01Step 1: Launch <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>First things first, launch the <strong>3D GIF maker</strong> that you intend to use. In our case, that is Filmora (a screenshot has been provided below for your edification and reference. We’ll be using Filmora as our example.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media &gt; Import Media File. However, you can also drag and drop your file(s) on the designated area of the UI..</p>

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>
<p>And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
