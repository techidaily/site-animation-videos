<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies.

<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time.

<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time.

<p><strong>●</strong> Slightly include other body-parts with shapes like ellipses, noodles in the form of contours.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw one centre-line across the head with well-balanced facial features.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw nose, mouth, ears for the face to form.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sketch contours of Popeye’s fists, and arms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can begin giving colors to this shape with flat layers of colorings</p>

<p>Work on the head first with nice &amp; precise circle in order to illustrate head portion. Inside this, you can add two more tiny circles for eyes. Once you are done with the eyes, you need to add large &amp; thin rectangle that represents headband. At one portion of headband draw tiny circle with small triangles in numbers 2.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>Left arm of our ninja can be sketched through a long &amp; thin rectangle. In order to showcase right arm, draw two rectangles and later on both hands has to be represented in terms of circles.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>Two Legs are also need to draw in terms of unusual position. So total of 5 rectangles has to be drawn for both legs &amp; feet.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p>Add accessories like sabre with basic shapes like circle or rectangle for the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong></p>
<p>Now refine it with an outline and work upon head to make sure both eyes will be clear &amp; visible and also keep the head round &amp; tight.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong></p>
<p>For upper portion, use nice curved lines and illustrate chest &amp; arms. For showing a discipline make use of good contour likes that highlights posture &amp; gesture.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong></p>
