The basics of animation were formulated in the 2000s from the moving page trick. The first few animators learned that animation is nothing but continuous switching of frames from one to another. One animated still is switched to another and then another in a quick sequence such that it makes a sequential moving frame. Today, animation has come a long way from where it started and today it is used for several commercials, tutorials, and even educational lecture videos. Pencil2D animation is an amazing animation tool that can be used by even neophytes. Want to learn more about 2d pencil animation and its super cool features? Well, you’re at the perfect place.

The brush tool"></a>1. The brush tool</h3><p>The brush tool must have reminded you of paint software in windows. The brush tool is a popular and highly utilitarian basic tool in Pencil2D animation software. You can either access it via the user interface or quickly access it by using the B key on your keyboard. As the name suggests, the brush tool is literally just a brush that allows you to draw and paint any sort of drawings of different shades, colors, and thickness. If you wish to change the color, you can find a color palette on the left side of the interface.</p>

<h3 id="2-The-eraser-tool"><a href="#2-The-eraser-tool" class="headerlink" title="2. The eraser tool"></a>2. The eraser tool</h3><p>You’ve a brush tool; it’s almost common sense that there’d be an eraser. The eraser tool has an eraser as its icon. If you wish to use the eraser, click on the eraser tool or simply click the E button on your keyboard. Once you’ve selected the tool, you need to simply hover over the parts you wish to erase.</p>

<h3 id="3-Bucket-tool"><a href="#3-Bucket-tool" class="headerlink" title="3. Bucket tool"></a>3. Bucket tool</h3><p>The bucket tool is another useful tool that you can find in the left tool pane of pencil 2d animation. The tool icon looks like a bucket and it is used to fill an entire area with a particular color. You can choose the color you’d like to fill from the color pallet available on the left side. Alternatively, you can also access the bucket tool by pressing the “K” key on your keyboard.</p>

<h3 id="4-Custom-colors"><a href="#4-Custom-colors" class="headerlink" title="4. Custom colors"></a>4. Custom colors</h3><p>A cool feature that you can find on pencil 2d animation software is the custom color one. You can merge and mix colors according to your choice and create your own color. To do so, you need to click on the small color box that you’ll find at the top right of your screen. By doing so, a huge color wheel will appear on your screen. Now you can either enter values of the R, G, and B if you wish to merge different colors and make a new one or select a particular color from the huge color wheel that appears in front of you. These colors vary in gradient, shade, and a lot of different factors.</p>

<h3 id="5-The-Undo-button"><a href="#5-The-Undo-button" class="headerlink" title="5. The Undo button"></a>5. The Undo button</h3><p>The Undo button is a highly useful functionality for the lazy ones who do not wish to erase the mistake they made. By undoing, the previous step gets reverted and you can start over again. The traditional undo shortcut, Ctrl+Z does work in the pencil 2d animation. Alternatively, you can also use the undo feature via the user interface. You can do so by heading over to the edit option in the topmost bar. The first option in the drop-down menu would be undo.</p>

Follow the steps listed below in order to learn how to animate through pencil 2d to make your first animation.</p>
<h3 id="1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame"><a href="#1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure that you’ve turned on your bitmap on the first frame"></a>1. Ensure that you’ve turned on your bitmap on the first frame</h3><p>Animation works through quick switching of frame which makes it appear as though the object is in motion. By turning on the bitmap, pencil 2d animation ensures that you’ve no blank frames at the start of your animation.</p>

<h3 id="2-Draw-your-animated-character"><a href="#2-Draw-your-animated-character" class="headerlink" title="2. Draw your animated character"></a>2. Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

<h3 id="3-The-three-circular-buttons"><a href="#3-The-three-circular-buttons" class="headerlink" title="3.The three circular buttons"></a>3.The three circular buttons</h3><p>Once you’re satisfied with the character you draw, you need to spot the 3 circular buttons which are arranged in the “+”,”-“,”+” order. By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

<h3 id="4-Repeat-until-you-get-an-animation"><a href="#4-Repeat-until-you-get-an-animation" class="headerlink" title="4.Repeat until you get an animation"></a>4.Repeat until you get an animation</h3><p>Now that you know how to deal with multiple frames, you can continue creating frames and making the animated characters move by tweaking with the drawing in every frame. For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation"><a href="#023D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations"><a href="#Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations"></a>Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations</h2><p>The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation-1"><a href="#023D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

It’s a very open subject.</p>
<h3 id="01GIFs-Are-Easy-to-Share-Ads"><a href="#01GIFs-Are-Easy-to-Share-Ads" class="headerlink" title="01GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads"></a>01<strong>GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads</strong></h3><p>The best part of GIFs is that they are easily consumable media that you can share just about everywhere. For example, you can include them in your email marketing to bring a little life to what could have otherwise been a very dry message You can also have it play out on social media without prompting (different from videos, which the user usually has to play before it starts going.)</p>

Eye-catching in a way that keeps you looking to catch the movement — in compared to if you were just looking at a still image (which might catch your attention for a moment, but usually bores you the next)</p>

Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving’ pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.</p>

Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example. With just one look, you can probably create an entire story in your head about the woman that is featured This can be very useful for future marketing prospects.</p>

Only, it’s a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below</p>

Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving’ pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.</p>

Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example.

Only, it’s a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below</p>
