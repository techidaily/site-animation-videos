<p>James Woods’ anachronistic Hollywood style “sweetie baby” patter and fast-talking, probably is not that far-off exactly from what you would like to hear in real life for TinselTown. In one of the episode of spin-off TV series by Disney: Hercules featured Jafar’s ghost in Strangers on the Train-style of plot to switch the enemies, Aladdin for the Hercules.

<h3 id="06Ren-Hoek-The-Ren-and-Stimpy-Show"><a href="#06Ren-Hoek-The-Ren-and-Stimpy-Show" class="headerlink" title="06Ren Hoek, The Ren and Stimpy Show"></a>06Ren Hoek, The Ren and Stimpy Show</h3><p><strong>Name of the cartoon character</strong>: Ren Hoek</p>

With his psychotic characteristics he is still among the list of dangerously wicked villains of all time. He is the<strong>Evil dog cartoon</strong>for all the puppies.</p>
<h3 id="07Scar-The-Lion-King"><a href="#07Scar-The-Lion-King" class="headerlink" title="07Scar, The Lion King"></a>07Scar, The Lion King</h3><p><strong>Name of the cartoon character</strong>: Scar</p>

<p>With George Sanders’s sophisticated, urbane voice the role of Sher-khan was one of the most brilliant performances an<strong>evil cat cartoon</strong> can ever have. It was the kind of performance that can’t be replicated. SherKhan’s above-it-all voice delivery is just an incredible as well as an interesting alternative to voiceless predator who usually threatening hero in this Disney film.</p>
<h3 id="09Mojo-Jojo-Powerpuff-Girls"><a href="#09Mojo-Jojo-Powerpuff-Girls" class="headerlink" title="09Mojo Jojo, Powerpuff Girls"></a>09Mojo Jojo, Powerpuff Girls</h3><p><strong>Name of the cartoon character</strong>: Mojo Jojo</p>
<p>He was the one with tough cookie, a booming voice &amp;different diabolical schemes as compared to what he knew in terms of what next to do. The bad monkey of animated cartoon characters always in a hurry to ruin the lives of Powerpuff Girls for different occasions, &amp; eventually succeeded in doing so in various episodes of ‘Powerpuff Girls’. A successful villain is always memorable, but one who is hyper-intelligent sometimes wins few more brownie points.</p>

The Joker from the Batman animated series and comic books is the most iconic villains of all times. Every single iteration of this ‘Clown Prince of Crime’delivers a new reason to love him. You can’t end the list of <strong>evil cartoon characters</strong> from 90’s without including MR. J. He has an intent of turning the ‘<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://batmantheanimatedseries.wikia.com/wiki/Gotham%5FCity" >Gotham City <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>’ into his petrifying playground.

<h3 id="11Maleficent-Sleeping-Beauty"><a href="#11Maleficent-Sleeping-Beauty" class="headerlink" title="11Maleficent, Sleeping Beauty"></a>11Maleficent, Sleeping Beauty</h3><p><strong>Name of the cartoon character</strong>: Maleficent</p>
<p>With her icy elegant looks and great entrance with a blaze of eldritch flame makes her a supreme contender of the most <strong>evil cartoon face.</strong> She has an impeccable fashion-sense also with spiky black &amp;purple robes and not to forget her headpiece shaped-like set of elegantly curved-horns.</p>
<p>She is the self-described “mistress’ of all devils.With being a nasty babe, she is sarcastically evil with her taunts and tortures of shooting lightning-bolts at her own cartoonish-minions.

<p>The evil queen’s performance in Snow white is way more than even the 21st century’s standards and she is still the scariest <strong>devil cartoon character.</strong> There is always a pair of ‘excellent’ shots in the Snow white movie that never fails to impress anyone. The elegant evil queen downs the area that will transform the queen into the withered hag with both foreground &amp;background elements framing the queen, suddenly slides intothe opposite directions &amp; at the end dissolve into the blur when the room starts to spin around her-this is something powerful multiplane-effect. She always manages to tell you about her evil acts with breath-taking moments of visually appealing storytelling.</p>

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>
