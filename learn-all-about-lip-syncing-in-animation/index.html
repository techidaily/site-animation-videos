<p>Lip syncing is one of the important parts of animations that need to be done perfectly. As children we have all enjoyed the special way in which Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse used to talk in cartoons, this is all because of the perfect lip-syncing.</p>

It is lip-syncing which brings life to the characters and makes them look talking. The process of lip-syncing in animations includes the dialogues and the mouth charts. The dialogues are broken into the phonetic syllables and the frames required for these syllables are then accessed.</p>
<p>Animations are moving and talking images and liveliness come from the dialogues that they speak. So, to make these talks appear real, flawless lip-syncing is very important.</p>
