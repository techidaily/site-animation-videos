This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.</p>
<p>Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
<p>This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although <strong>Adobe 3D animation</strong> can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.</p>
<p>This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.</p>
<p>It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.</p>
<h3 id="01How-is-After-Effects-used"><a href="#01How-is-After-Effects-used" class="headerlink" title="01How is After Effects used?"></a>01How is After Effects used?</h3><p>The primary uses of After Effects categorize into three sections:</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Animation</strong>, and</p>

<p>It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>

<p>• Download the Gboard from the Play Store or whichever playstore you want.</p>
<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>
<p>• Double-check that Gboard is selected as your primary keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, grant any permissions it requires so that you can use it right away in Snapchat.</p>
<p>Now that it’s as simple as it gets, let’s send comparable GIFs utilizing iOS devices.</p>
<p>For iPhone&#x2F;iPad:</p>

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Today there is a lot pre-made skeletons you can use and reuse as many times as you want, making only a few minor adjustments to the base design. If your creativity is sparking like firecrackers, then a rig can make it look more defined and&#x2F;or realistic.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Let’s talk more about <strong>Rigging Animation</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Rigging Animation](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Rigging-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Rigging-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Rigging Animation"></a>Part 1 What is Rigging Animation</h2><h3 id="01Why-Your-Animators-Need-to-Know-How-to-Rig"><a href="#01Why-Your-Animators-Need-to-Know-How-to-Rig" class="headerlink" title="01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig"></a>01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig</h3><p>Walk into any professional animation studio toady, you would notice unfamiliar skeleton figures in at least one of the screens.</p>
<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work-1"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work-1" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used-1"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used-1" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work-2"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work-2" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>

<h2 id="The-list-of-6-types-of-animation-3"><a href="#The-list-of-6-types-of-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="The list of 6 types of animation"></a>The list of 6 types of animation</h2><h4 id="1-Traditional-animation-3"><a href="#1-Traditional-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Traditional animation"></a>1. Traditional animation</h4><p>As you would expect, this type of animation is the kind of old classic animation drawn on paper. The characters, backgrounds and layout were normally committed to paper by hand, with each drawing being slightly different from its predecessor. The papers were placed on sheets called cels before paint was added to them. Advancements in technology mean animation can be hand-drawn before color is added via software.</p>
<p>Synfig Studio is a popular product for those wishing to produce videos that are traditional in look and feel. It supports a variety of layers and offers a bone system as well as sound support.</p>
<h4 id="2-2D-animation-3"><a href="#2-2D-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="2. 2D animation"></a>2. 2D animation</h4><p>With 2D animation, movement is created in a two-dimensional environment. Characters and figures can move up, down, left or right but won’t move nearer or further away from the viewer. Many <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animated video software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used to make this kind of video. Pencil 2D is a leading solution noted for its simplicity and ease of use.</p>
<p>This type of animation is ideal for animating on the move and runs on various operating platforms. What’s also great about Pencil 2D is that it allows you to switch between raster and vector workflows quickly and is completely free to use, even if you need it for commercial purposes.</p>
<h4 id="3-3D-animation-3"><a href="#3-3D-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="3. 3D animation"></a>3. 3D animation</h4><p>With 3D animation, you can represent real-world 3D images in a digital space. The main three processes of 3D are modeling, layout and animation plus rendering. There are many reliable solutions for 3D animation on the market, with Autodesk 3DS Max being a market leader.</p>
<p>This product offers simple, robust modeling, allowing you to create a wide range of environments with richly-detailed characters and enjoy high-end rendering. It is used for producing games, product design, architecture and more.</p>
<h4 id="4-Clay-animation-3"><a href="#4-Clay-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Clay animation"></a>4. Clay animation</h4><p>Clay animation is also called claymation and has been around for many years. In clay animation, clay pieces are used to create characters and background animation. The pieces are moved or deformed between frames so continuous motion can occur.</p>
<p>One leading solution for clay animation is Adobe Animate CC. With this product, you can create vector animations for apps, games, videos and more. You can publish the results quickly and can animate pretty much anything, allowing your characters to walk, talk, blink and more with ease.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to create illusions of depths via the enhanced camera tool, and new features are being added all the time.</p>
<h4 id="5-HTML-animation-3"><a href="#5-HTML-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="5. HTML animation"></a>5. HTML animation</h4><p>HMTL5 allows you to do all sorts of things including elements of video and animation creation. You can create excellent animated content via a fusion of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3. HTML5 is essentially the language of today’s most exciting websites and is used to add vast beauty and efficiency to them.</p>
<p>HTML5 Maker is a free solution ideal for beginners and pros that supports various leading text filters and offers a diverse library of images. You can use this tool to produce elegant animations with stunning transitions and create gorgeous Instagram-esque effects.</p>
<h4 id="6-Kinetic-Typography-Animation-3"><a href="#6-Kinetic-Typography-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Kinetic Typography Animation"></a>6. Kinetic Typography Animation</h4><p>Typography animation as another type of animation enables you to do all sorts of exciting and thought-provoking things with letters and fonts. Kinetic typography is based on the concept of moving text and is often used for advertising purposes and to deliver important information including statistics and more.</p>
<p>Videos involving kinetic typography animation can help you demand the attention of your audience. One very popular tool for creating kinetic typography animation is Renderforest.</p>
<p>This solution is ideal even for those without vast technical expertise and helps you create animations, music visualizations, slideshows and much more in mere moments. Trailers, YouTube openings, logo animations are frequently created with the tool, as are explainer animations and whiteboard videos, to give you just a few more examples.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-11"><a href="#Conclusion-11" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Once you have found the types of animated videos and tools that appeal to you the most and have created your content, you can put magical finishing touches to your videos by using Filmora.</p>
