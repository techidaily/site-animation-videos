<p>02 [Step by Step to Help You Understand 2D&#x2F;3D Character Design](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

<p>Character rigging involves some easy steps. And the best way for it is <strong>Adobe animate rigging</strong>. We have laid down the following discussion to help you learn the easiest method of character rigging. And along with it, we will also help you understand both 2D and 3D character designing most effortlessly.</p>
<p>Lastly, and most importantly, it is vital to opt for the simplest yet feature-loaded tool for any animation work. Thus, we will also mention the best tool for animation and video editing. So, without any further wait, let us start our discussion.</p>

<p>02 [Step by Step to Help You Understand 2D&#x2F;3D Character Design](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Animate-Character-Design-1"><a href="#01Animate-Character-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="01Animate Character Design"></a>01Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are some steps involved in the designing a character for animation. And those steps are pretty diverse. So, we have enlisted all the required steps and factors to help you learn and understand character designing for animation. The list is as follows.</p>
<h3 id="02Understanding-your-audience-1"><a href="#02Understanding-your-audience-1" class="headerlink" title="02Understanding your audience"></a>02Understanding your audience</h3><p>To create the best character design, it is essential that you understand your target audience. If your target audience includes the kids and the children, your character design will primarily be based on cartoons.</p>
<p>Ensure which genre of animation does your audience prefer? If it is funny or mythological or any other genre, you design your characters accordingly.</p>

Different types serve different purposes and genres. So, let us know about the different types of animations, and this will help you understand which one would suit your requirements.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Pop-style Characters</strong></p>
<p>The characters you see in the comics and superhero animation movies are pop-style characters. They are highly expressive, become the centre of attraction and always are dominant on the screen. They tend to deliver an energy that reaches the audience impeccably.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="pop style character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Iconic design</strong></p>
<p>These characters are less fancy but highly expressive. They usually have a block face yet connect to an audience of all types. They are generally best for the corporate videos and those with some messages to be delivered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iconic design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Editorial Style Characters</strong></p>
<p>These characters are highly elegant and bold. These are characters that we see in different publications. They consist of great style, realisticity and cleanliness. They are mainly used to express the quality of presence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="editorial design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sketch and experiment</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know about the different character types, it will help you understand which one would match the genre of animation you prefer to work on. So, start sketching your imagination in a draft.</p>
<p>Decide on the different poses your character might have. Track them down in a draft. It helps you become organised and put down your plan and creativity collectively.</p>
<p>Trial and error are one of the best ways to achieve perfection. So, it is crucial to sketch and then take feedback. If they do not appear praiseworthy, continue sketching and then get feedback again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animate and execute</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be best to execute all your drafts and imaginations. Try using the animation tools that suit your skill capacity and genre of animation the best.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Character-Design-1"><a href="#04Animate-Character-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Character Design"></a>04Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are five simple steps that will help you animate a character design in 3D. The steps are as follows.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Animate-Character-Design-2"><a href="#01Animate-Character-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="01Animate Character Design"></a>01Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are some steps involved in the designing a character for animation.

Different types serve different purposes and genres. So, let us know about the different types of animations, and this will help you understand which one would suit your requirements.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Pop-style Characters</strong></p>
<p>The characters you see in the comics and superhero animation movies are pop-style characters. They are highly expressive, become the centre of attraction and always are dominant on the screen. They tend to deliver an energy that reaches the audience impeccably.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="pop style character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Iconic design</strong></p>
<p>These characters are less fancy but highly expressive. They usually have a block face yet connect to an audience of all types. They are generally best for the corporate videos and those with some messages to be delivered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sketch and experiment</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know about the different character types, it will help you understand which one would match the genre of animation you prefer to work on. So, start sketching your imagination in a draft.</p>
<p>Decide on the different poses your character might have. Track them down in a draft. It helps you become organised and put down your plan and creativity collectively.</p>
<p>Trial and error are one of the best ways to achieve perfection. So, it is crucial to sketch and then take feedback. If they do not appear praiseworthy, continue sketching and then get feedback again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animate and execute</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be best to execute all your drafts and imaginations. Try using the animation tools that suit your skill capacity and genre of animation the best.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Character-Design-2"><a href="#04Animate-Character-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Character Design"></a>04Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are five simple steps that will help you animate a character design in 3D. The steps are as follows.</p>

<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>

<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Animate-Character-Design-3"><a href="#01Animate-Character-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="01Animate Character Design"></a>01Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are some steps involved in the designing a character for animation. And those steps are pretty diverse. So, we have enlisted all the required steps and factors to help you learn and understand character designing for animation. The list is as follows.</p>
<h3 id="02Understanding-your-audience-3"><a href="#02Understanding-your-audience-3" class="headerlink" title="02Understanding your audience"></a>02Understanding your audience</h3><p>To create the best character design, it is essential that you understand your target audience. If your target audience includes the kids and the children, your character design will primarily be based on cartoons.</p>
<p>Ensure which genre of animation does your audience prefer? If it is funny or mythological or any other genre, you design your characters accordingly.</p>

Different types serve different purposes and genres. So, let us know about the different types of animations, and this will help you understand which one would suit your requirements.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Pop-style Characters</strong></p>
<p>The characters you see in the comics and superhero animation movies are pop-style characters. They are highly expressive, become the centre of attraction and always are dominant on the screen. They tend to deliver an energy that reaches the audience impeccably.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="pop style character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Iconic design</strong></p>
<p>These characters are less fancy but highly expressive. They usually have a block face yet connect to an audience of all types. They are generally best for the corporate videos and those with some messages to be delivered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iconic design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Editorial Style Characters</strong></p>
<p>These characters are highly elegant and bold. These are characters that we see in different publications. They consist of great style, realisticity and cleanliness. They are mainly used to express the quality of presence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="editorial design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sketch and experiment</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know about the different character types, it will help you understand which one would match the genre of animation you prefer to work on. So, start sketching your imagination in a draft.</p>
<p>Decide on the different poses your character might have. Track them down in a draft. It helps you become organised and put down your plan and creativity collectively.</p>
<p>Trial and error are one of the best ways to achieve perfection. So, it is crucial to sketch and then take feedback. If they do not appear praiseworthy, continue sketching and then get feedback again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animate and execute</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be best to execute all your drafts and imaginations. Try using the animation tools that suit your skill capacity and genre of animation the best.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Character-Design-3"><a href="#04Animate-Character-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Character Design"></a>04Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are five simple steps that will help you animate a character design in 3D. The steps are as follows.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation"><a href="#023D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations"><a href="#Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations"></a>Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations</h2><p>The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation-1"><a href="#023D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>.

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>

The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
