<p>This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of <strong>animate rigging</strong></p>
<p>To help them out (as well as other <strong>animation rigging</strong> beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [The Only Guide You’ll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation](#Part 1)</p>

This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

<h3 id="02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging"><a href="#02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging"></a>02<strong>An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>
<h3 id="04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving"><a href="#04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving" class="headerlink" title="04Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving"></a>04<strong>Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving</strong></h3><p>Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>

<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>

This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>

<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>Manually make connections starting with the joints.</p>
<p>Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.</p>
<p>Motion can then be added to the timeline.</p>

<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>

<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>

This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-2"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>

<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>Manually make connections starting with the joints.</p>
<p>Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.</p>
<p>Motion can then be added to the timeline.</p>

<p>This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of <strong>animate rigging</strong></p>
<p>To help them out (as well as other <strong>animation rigging</strong> beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!</p>

This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-3"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-3"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?"></a>Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?</h2><h3 id="1-Start-With-a-Script"><a href="#1-Start-With-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

However, many beginners want to know if it’s easy to use Adobe character animator. The answer is Yes! With Character Animator, Adobe has developed a relatively easy-to-use interface that anyone can use easily.</p>

Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover-1"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character-1"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Is-Adobe-Character-Animator-Easy-to-Use-1"><a href="#Part-2-Is-Adobe-Character-Animator-Easy-to-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?"></a>Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?</h2><p>That’s how you can animate a character in Adobe character animator and create visually stunning animations. However, many beginners want to know if it’s easy to use Adobe character animator. The answer is Yes!

Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover-3"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character-3"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg"
                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

You can find thousands of GIFs shared by users from all across the world. The GIFs are neatly sorted into categories so that you can find your favorite ones easily.</p>
<p>Gfycat was the pioneer in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video to GIF conversion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>Gfycat now enables you to share GIFs with sound. You can upload any video and convert it to a GIF without sacrificing the sound. However, you can only upload only up to a minute of GIF that contains sound.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to create your GIF with sound-</p>

You can find thousands of GIFs shared by users from all across the world. The GIFs are neatly sorted into categories so that you can find your favorite ones easily.</p>
<p>Gfycat was the pioneer in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video to GIF conversion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>Gfycat now enables you to share GIFs with sound. You can upload any video and convert it to a GIF without sacrificing the sound. However, you can only upload only up to a minute of GIF that contains sound.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to create your GIF with sound-</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the Gfycat website and choose the video you want to convert. You can add files from your device or use URLs of video sites. Be sure to choose small file sizes for the best results.</li>
