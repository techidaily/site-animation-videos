Plus how to cartoon yourself with it"></a>Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it</h2><p>We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>

Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.</p>
<p>There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create 3d cartoon photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>

<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png"
                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 07"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 07"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 12"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 13"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Finally, and there you have it. Congratulation! You now have your perfect, awesome, beautiful, and YOUR cartoon.</p>

<p>Today there is a lot pre-made skeletons you can use and reuse as many times as you want, making only a few minor adjustments to the base design. If your creativity is sparking like firecrackers, then a rig can make it look more defined and&#x2F;or realistic.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Let’s talk more about <strong>Rigging Animation</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Rigging-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Rigging-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Rigging Animation"></a>Part 1 What is Rigging Animation</h2><h3 id="01Why-Your-Animators-Need-to-Know-How-to-Rig"><a href="#01Why-Your-Animators-Need-to-Know-How-to-Rig" class="headerlink" title="01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig"></a>01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig</h3><p>Walk into any professional animation studio toady, you would notice unfamiliar skeleton figures in at least one of the screens.</p>
<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>
<h3 id="04Intro-to-Rigging-Software"><a href="#04Intro-to-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="04Intro to Rigging Software"></a>04Intro to Rigging Software</h3><p>You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.</p>
<p>Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.</p>
<p>Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.</p>
<p>Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.</p>
<p>You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.</p>

Maya is probably the one software which gives you credit for just knowing it.</p>
<p>Maya has several levels of features you need to practice before you can call yourself a Maya master.</p>
<p>The best way to get your hands practiced on animating on Maya is by becoming well versed with all the stats and proportions while working with rigs. You would surely need to get your hands on high quality rig packages that makes the learning experience even more worth it.</p>
<p>With time, you would get better at understanding of the specifics of building a structure you would be showing in the final result. However getting stuck with the wrong type of rig can end up making your animating experience counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Here is a list of Maya Rigs you can start on right away;</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>

<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>

<p>Not convinced? Let’s talk more about <strong>Rigging Animation</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-23"><a href="#In-this-article-23" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Rigging Animation](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [The Ultimate Collection for Free Maya Rigs [2022]](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Rigging-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Rigging-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Rigging Animation"></a>Part 1 What is Rigging Animation</h2><h3 id="01Why-Your-Animators-Need-to-Know-How-to-Rig-3"><a href="#01Why-Your-Animators-Need-to-Know-How-to-Rig-3" class="headerlink" title="01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig"></a>01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig</h3><p>Walk into any professional animation studio toady, you would notice unfamiliar skeleton figures in at least one of the screens.</p>
<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work-3"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used-3"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used-3" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>
<h3 id="04Intro-to-Rigging-Software-3"><a href="#04Intro-to-Rigging-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="04Intro to Rigging Software"></a>04Intro to Rigging Software</h3><p>You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.</p>
<p>Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.</p>
<p>Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.</p>
<p>Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.</p>
<p>You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.</p>

Maya is probably the one software which gives you credit for just knowing it.</p>
<p>Maya has several levels of features you need to practice before you can call yourself a Maya master.</p>
<p>The best way to get your hands practiced on animating on Maya is by becoming well versed with all the stats and proportions while working with rigs. You would surely need to get your hands on high quality rig packages that makes the learning experience even more worth it.</p>
<p>With time, you would get better at understanding of the specifics of building a structure you would be showing in the final result. However getting stuck with the wrong type of rig can end up making your animating experience counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Here is a list of Maya Rigs you can start on right away;</p>
