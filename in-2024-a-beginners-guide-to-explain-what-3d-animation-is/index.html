<p>With present-day technology, <strong>3D animation</strong> has reached all spheres be it entertainment, advertising, architecture, education, and much more. With the increasing use of 3D animation, there is a rise in the tools and programs used for creating such animations.</p>
<p>So, to help you get all the details about 3D animation, <strong>3D modelling and animation process</strong>, best tools, tips, and tricks, keep reading the following parts.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-does-3D-animation-mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-does-3D-animation-mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?"></a>Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?</h2><p>In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating <strong>animation 3D models</strong>.</p>
<p>The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-process-of-3D-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-process-of-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?</h2><p>Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Modeling"><a href="#01Modeling" class="headerlink" title="01Modeling"></a>01Modeling</h3><p>The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.</p>
<h3 id="02Layout-and-animation"><a href="#02Layout-and-animation" class="headerlink" title="02Layout and animation"></a>02Layout and animation</h3><p>The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="03Rendering"><a href="#03Rendering" class="headerlink" title="03Rendering"></a>03Rendering</h3><p>The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.</p>
<p>After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.</p>

Some of the key ones are as below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D videos and movies</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive 3D</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Digital 3D</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Clay Motion also termed Stop motion animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Pixilation</p>

The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating <strong>animation 3D models</strong>.</p>
<p>The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.</p>

Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Modeling-1"><a href="#01Modeling-1" class="headerlink" title="01Modeling"></a>01Modeling</h3><p>The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.</p>
<h3 id="02Layout-and-animation-1"><a href="#02Layout-and-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="02Layout and animation"></a>02Layout and animation</h3><p>The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="03Rendering-1"><a href="#03Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="03Rendering"></a>03Rendering</h3><p>The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.</p>
<p>After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.</p>

The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating <strong>animation 3D models</strong>.</p>
<p>The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.</p>

Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Modeling-2"><a href="#01Modeling-2" class="headerlink" title="01Modeling"></a>01Modeling</h3><p>The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.</p>
<h3 id="02Layout-and-animation-2"><a href="#02Layout-and-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Layout and animation"></a>02Layout and animation</h3><p>The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="03Rendering-2"><a href="#03Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="03Rendering"></a>03Rendering</h3><p>The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.</p>
<p>After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.</p>

<p>From among the several trends that emerged on Social Media, making a 3D cartoon of yourself is probably the most popular.</p>
<p>Learning how to make 3D cartoons may just be in the height of demand in the near future.</p>

Plus how to cartoon yourself with it"></a>Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it</h2><p>We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="voila ai artist"
                ></p>
<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-make-3D-Cartoon-From-a-Photo"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-make-3D-Cartoon-From-a-Photo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo"></a>Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo</h2><p>Photoshop is no doubt one of the most influential digital assets that allow you to do virtually anything with your photos. Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.</p>
<p>There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool"><a href="#01Brush-Tool" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool"><a href="#03Pen-Tool" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-1"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-1"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-1" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-1"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-2"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-2"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-2" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-2"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-3"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-3"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-3" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-3"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Creating Additional Layers</strong></p>
<p>You are now required to create three more layers, with the same process as for the above two, for adding effects to the Skin, Clothes and Teeth&#x2F;Eyes of the portrait. When you finish creation, assign suitable names to the layers, followed by dragging them below the ‘Black’ one within the ‘Layers’ panel.</p>

                      alt="&quot;Photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12: Color Selection and Application</strong></p>
<p>Choose the respective colors for the clothes, skin and teeth&#x2F;eyes of the cartoonized edit. To proceed with color application, navigate to the toolbar at the left of the Photoshop workspace and choose the ‘Brush Tool’. Finally, choose a particular layer and apply careful brush strokes to add color to the specific area of the portrait that you wish to edit. Follow the same process to add colors to the remaining layers to get the desired result in all areas of your cartoonized edit.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13: Using the Gradient Tool</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel again and create a new ‘Gradient’ layer to further enhance your creation. You now need to select the ‘Gradient Tool’ from the toolbar at the left of the Photoshop workspace. The ‘Gradient Editor’ pops up with the continuously running ‘Gradient Bar’, as soon as you make the selection. Double click on the gradient boxes at both ends to select them, followed by making your color choices. Tap on ‘OK’ when you are satisfied with your work.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Image Editor- Using the ‘Gradient’ Tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 14: Filling the Gradients</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with gradient filling, press and hold the mouse button on the image at the bottom left and continue to drag the cursor to its top right corner. Leave the mouse and navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel for dragging and dropping the ‘Gradient’ layer above the ‘White’ layer.</p>

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-record-anime4.jpg"
                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-anime-video6.jpg"

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-record-anime4.jpg"
                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-anime-video6.jpg"

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>

<h2 id="New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC"><a href="#New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC" class="headerlink" title="New features of Adobe Animate CC"></a>New features of Adobe Animate CC</h2><h4 id="1-Adobe-Animate-Camera"><a href="#1-Adobe-Animate-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1. Adobe Animate Camera"></a>1. Adobe Animate Camera</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC introduces virtual camera functionality unlike other <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>Making it simpler, you can effortlessly execute panning, zooming and rotating to your animations if you wish. Using the virtual camera in Animate CC, you will be enabling to add more dramatic effects while creating an animation.</p>
<p>For instance, if there’s a fighting scene in our animated movie, you can rotate at the moment the scene shows destruction to give it a dramatic effect or you can zoom in or out and change the viewer’s attention from one point to the other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Export-format"><a href="#2-Export-format" class="headerlink" title="2. Export format"></a>2. Export format</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC has adapted the web standards for the exporting your animation which makes it easier for everyone to view it from desktop to mobile device.</p>
<p>This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.</p>
<p>Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h4 id="3-Vector-brushes"><a href="#3-Vector-brushes" class="headerlink" title="3. Vector brushes"></a>3. Vector brushes</h4><p>Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.</p>
<p>This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Audio-Syncing"><a href="#4-Audio-Syncing" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Syncing"></a>4. Audio Syncing</h4><p>The timeline feature of the tool will now allow the users to sync audios in their animations and this is a yet another feature that Animate CC has added. This means you can do audio synchronization for your animation series.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h4 id="5-Font"><a href="#5-Font" class="headerlink" title="5. Font"></a>5. Font</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts.

<h2 id="New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC-2"><a href="#New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC-2" class="headerlink" title="New features of Adobe Animate CC"></a>New features of Adobe Animate CC</h2><h4 id="1-Adobe-Animate-Camera-2"><a href="#1-Adobe-Animate-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Adobe Animate Camera"></a>1. Adobe Animate Camera</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC introduces virtual camera functionality unlike other <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of this feature, you can easily stimulate your camera’s movement giving your animation a more realistic view.</p>
<p>Making it simpler, you can effortlessly execute panning, zooming and rotating to your animations if you wish. Using the virtual camera in Animate CC, you will be enabling to add more dramatic effects while creating an animation.</p>
<p>For instance, if there’s a fighting scene in our animated movie, you can rotate at the moment the scene shows destruction to give it a dramatic effect or you can zoom in or out and change the viewer’s attention from one point to the other.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-camera.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc camera"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Export-format-2"><a href="#2-Export-format-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Export format"></a>2. Export format</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC has adapted the web standards for the exporting your animation which makes it easier for everyone to view it from desktop to mobile device.</p>
<p>This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.</p>
<p>Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-export-format.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc export format"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Vector-brushes-2"><a href="#3-Vector-brushes-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Vector brushes"></a>3. Vector brushes</h4><p>Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.</p>
<p>This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-vector-brush.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc vector brush"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Audio-Syncing-2"><a href="#4-Audio-Syncing-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Syncing"></a>4. Audio Syncing</h4><p>The timeline feature of the tool will now allow the users to sync audios in their animations and this is a yet another feature that Animate CC has added. This means you can do audio synchronization for your animation series.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-audio-syncing.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc audio syncing"
                ></p>
<p>Nevertheless, doing this can be a little demanding as well as time-consuming with HTML5 alone. In addition, you also get enabled for audio loop control with the Adobe Animate CC’s timeline feature.</p>
<h4 id="5-Font-2"><a href="#5-Font-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Font"></a>5. Font</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts. These web fonts will be present for HTML5 canvas documents in the tool. Users can pick out from thousands of high-quality fonts via a subscription plan.</p>
<p>Putting in different words, first you can try some selected fonts available in the Typekit library via any level of Creative Cloud plan. Then when you subscribe by spending some money, you can then get access to complete Typekit library where there are thousands of premium fonts for HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-font.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc font"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-2"><a href="#Final-Verdict-2" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Animation industry is no doubt a very interesting one and having the best tool can make it more interesting and fun. After making you familiarize with the top functionalities that are coming with Adobe Animate CC, we feel it would be fair to end the discussion here. Hope you will not give a second thought on Animate CC when need to do flash animation.</p>
<p>Before ending, one more thing that we would like to give the other thought by introducing you Filmora.</p>
<p>No, this is a not another feature, but an interesting yet powerful video editing software created by Wondershare, one of the leading brand in multimedia field. You can use this tool and get your animated videos edited using its extraordinary effects.</p>
