You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.</p>
<h3 id="01-Smurfette"><a href="#01-Smurfette" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.</p>
<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.</p>
<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat"><a href="#05Top-Cat" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He’s wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he’s making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones’ basic Hanna-Barbera art style.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<h3 id="06Helga-G-Pataki"><a href="#06Helga-G-Pataki" class="headerlink" title="06Helga. G. Pataki"></a>06Helga. G. Pataki</h3><p>Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There’s a lot that’s bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it.

There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.</p>
<h3 id="01-Smurfette-1"><a href="#01-Smurfette-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles-1"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles-1" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.</p>
<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear-1"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear-1" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.</p>
<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla-1"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla-1" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat-1"><a href="#05Top-Cat-1" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He’s wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he’s making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones’ basic Hanna-Barbera art style.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<h3 id="06Helga-G-Pataki-1"><a href="#06Helga-G-Pataki-1" class="headerlink" title="06Helga. G. Pataki"></a>06Helga. G. Pataki</h3><p>Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There’s a lot that’s bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it. Just keep an eye on her head since getting it correct, especially with her rectangle hairdo, can be a little odd.</p>

Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones.

You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animating Images in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva"><a href="#2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?"></a>2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?</h3><p>Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva"><a href="#2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?"></a>2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?</h3><p>Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>

                      alt="Video Animation in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-2"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>

<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>

The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

How To Set A GIF Loop Count?</h4><p>Nearly all GIF editors allow you to specify how many loops a GIF is going to make before it comes to a stop. All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

<p>Our topic for today’s article is on that exact same subject. Or, rather, more specifically, <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who want more than the usual robotic text-to-speech AI that you see in more professional software. Learn more about all this below, we’ve prepared an entire guide for you!</p>

Starting with:</p>
<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube"></a>Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube</h2><p>If you want to create your own <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Reading Speed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel &gt; Speech page for the option to apply it there.</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier"><a href="#01Flixier" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>

So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>

However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>

Starting with:</p>
<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-1"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-1" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-1"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-1" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube"></a>Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube</h2><p>If you want to create your own <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-1"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-1" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>

For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-2"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-2" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel &gt; Speech page for the option to apply it there.</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier-2"><a href="#01Flixier-2" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>

                      alt="Flixier Online Video Editor"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord-2"><a href="#02Woord-2" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

                      alt="Woord"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Speechelo-2"><a href="#03Speechelo-2" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4-2"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4-2" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A wide variety of voice options to choose from.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05TTS-Reader-2"><a href="#05TTS-Reader-2" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available to use online for FREE.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable speed for voice.</p>

<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Get-More-Voices-for-Text-to-Speech-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Get-More-Voices-for-Text-to-Speech-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?"></a>Part 3 <strong>How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?</strong></h2><p>If you think that the available <strong>cartoon characters text-to-speech</strong> voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-3"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-3" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel &gt; Speech page for the option to apply it there.</p>

Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes <strong>text-to-speech cartoon characters</strong> and <strong>text-to-speech anime characters</strong> voices!</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier-3"><a href="#01Flixier-3" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Flixier Online Video Editor"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord-3"><a href="#02Woord-3" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

                      alt="Woord"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Speechelo-3"><a href="#03Speechelo-3" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4-3"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4-3" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A wide variety of voice options to choose from.</p>

                      alt="Cartoon Animator 4"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05TTS-Reader-3"><a href="#05TTS-Reader-3" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available to use online for FREE.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable speed for voice.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it’s important that you’re aware of all the different options out there!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you’ll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, you’ll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.</p>
