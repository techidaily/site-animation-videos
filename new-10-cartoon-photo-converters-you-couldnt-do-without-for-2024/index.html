<p>To whatever generation or kind one could belong to, animation style videos attract people of all ages, and you will be one of them for sure. Rather than ordinary videos, animated ones provoke diverse impacts on the audience utilizing kinesthetic, illustration, and aural. But the reality or fact is, due to overexposure to social media sites and technological advancements, we have forgotten its importance. They are on the verge of existence at present. Are you an art lover who wishes to know more about <strong>animation styles</strong>? Want to know some of the software tools that can bring out the artist in you?

<h2 id="5-Different-Animation-Styles"><a href="#5-Different-Animation-Styles" class="headerlink" title="5 Different Animation Styles"></a>5 Different Animation Styles</h2><p>Ready to enter into the world of animation along with us? We are all set to take you through a ride of different animation styles, their importance, and some of the videos that one should give a try!</p>
<h4 id="1-2D-Animation"><a href="#1-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="1.  2D Animation"></a>1.  2D Animation</h4><p>Let’s start with 2D as our fist animation style, which is the traditional or oldest form in practice for more than 100 years since 1908. 2D has widely been in usage to create animated short films, cartoon characters, games, marketing videos, and educational materials. In 2D animation, the characters or items, creatures, and backgrounds get crafted in a two-dimensional space. It produces a graphic of movement with the drawings played serially one after another.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: At present, various free animator tools like Creatoon, Blender, and Pencil 2D, whereas, for professionals, Encore, Flash, Toon Boom Harmony, and Adobe Photoshop can be handy!</p>
<p>The above 2D animation style video is a short film “Dark Dark Woods” directed by the students at “The Animation Workshop.” It is all about the young princess, Maria, drenched, and tired of living a royal life being filled with rules, duties, lessons, responsibilities, and customs. One night, she enters into an adventurous event where she finds herself in a mysterious monster-filled dark wood. Watch the film and find did she find out there!</p>
<h4 id="2-3D-Animation"><a href="#2-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="2.  3D Animation"></a>2.  3D Animation</h4><p>As the next version of 2D, in the animation industry, 3D revolutionized the market since its first appearance in 1972. Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.</p>
<p>Do you know how it feels if you are trapped alone on a deserted island? “It’s a Cinch!” is a fantastic, funny 3D short film that is an adventurous movie made by the ESMA team at CGI. For sure, you will like this funny movie all about atrocities happening with a man and a pelican and enjoy it as much as I did!</p>
<h4 id="3-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#3-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="3.  Motion Graphics"></a>3.  Motion Graphics</h4><p>Our next animation style is motion graphics of the animated graphic design, where text appears to be the main enhancing factor. It is a piece of animation or digital footage that illuminates a motion or notation incorporated with audio. It is a new way of communicating to the audience and in driving them deep into the story. You can categorize it under the visual effect technique, which involves the movement of graphic images or elements like logos or text, sound, music, and motion. Motion graphics are best to be found in action and finds a place in multimedia projects, advertising agencies, branding, television title making, and storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: Tools that are best for motion graphics is Mocha AE, After Effects, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D.</p>
<p>The world is a great place, but we always forget another beautiful hidden green world behind the fantastic buildings we reside in. Yes, “Beautiful World” is a motion graphic video by Blasterjaxx &amp; DBSTF feat. Ryder presents how we humans have developed a great empire by destroying the other beautiful part of the world.</p>
<h4 id="4-Stop-Motion"><a href="#4-Stop-Motion" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stop Motion"></a>4.  Stop Motion</h4><p>Stop motion is one of the traditional animation styles that is the most popular filmmaking technique that uses hand-crafted or manipulated objects, mostly clay models. Puppets, silhouettes, and cut-outs can also be implemented as stop motion aids to produce animation. It is labor-intensive, a form of art, and has its flavor in animation, although 3D and visual effects have replaced it quite a long time before. But still, filmmakers like Tim Burton use stop motion in their films, making it to withstand the animation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: You can make your stop motion video with software like Dragon frame, Stop Motion Pro Eclipse, and IKITMovie.</p>
<p>Although stop motion has gone before ages, there is still a fantastic introduction. Here is an award-winning short film, “Tokri (the basket),” which is a clumsy accident that leads a juvenile girl onto Mumbai’s streets with the trust of making things correct. Studio Eeksaurus, an Indian bastion animation company, has depicted a father and daughter’s tender emotive tale.</p>
<h4 id="5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation"><a href="#5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation" class="headerlink" title="5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation"></a>5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation</h4><p>Here is a Paint-on-Glass animation style that is a technique used for making animated films that gives a lot of fun. Artists paint short stories on glasses using oil paints and film them by recording it frame-by-frame. Russian animator Aleksandr Petrov is a famous artist well known for making award-winning paint-on-glass animation. Animators use different objects like brick dust, sand, pastels, and charcoal, to create outstanding drama in their films.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: You can also become a paint-on-glass animator now with tools like Pencil 2D, Blender, Krita, and GIMP.</p>
<p>Suppose you are wondering whether you could find any paint-on-glass animated movie on social media sites. In that case, there are numerous animated films, like “The Old Man and the Sea,” and “My Love,” produced by the experts of pictures of Aleksandr Petrov animation. Surprisingly, this bind-blowing introduction is a result of oil paints on a sheet of glass.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Do you aspire to become an animator and come up painting bright colors to videos? Choose animation styles that you most enjoy, find attractive today, and start working on it. Lastly, do not forget to give Filmora a chance to uplift your creation and give your animation style a life!</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>

And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

<h3 id="02Anticipation"><a href="#02Anticipation" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

<h3 id="04Timing"><a href="#04Timing" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun"><a href="#01It-is-fun" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression"><a href="#02Lasting-impression" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>

However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget"><a href="#01Budget" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience"><a href="#03Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market"><a href="#04Market" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>

And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch-2"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch-2" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation-2"><a href="#02Anticipation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out-2"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out-2" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing-2"><a href="#04Timing-2" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing-2"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing-2" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun-2"><a href="#01It-is-fun-2" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-2"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-2" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-2"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-2" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-2"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-2"><a href="#01Budget-2" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-2"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-2" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-2"><a href="#03Target-Audience-2" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-2"><a href="#04Market-2" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-2"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-2" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-3"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-3" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-3"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-3" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>

However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-3"><a href="#01Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-3"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-3" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-3"><a href="#03Target-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-3"><a href="#04Market-3" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview gifs GIF combining maker"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change image settings</p>
<p>After finalizing the best preview for your edited files, you can hit the file menu option and then save your project for device or web option. It will immediately open a dialogue box where users can easily specify their image quality and loop count details. Never forget to have one more preview before saving the final results.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/looping-counts.jpg"
                      alt="looping counts to combine"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Save your project</p>
<p>As now you are done with all the editing tasks so it is time to hit the “Save” option and then provide your destination address to the modified file. Your animated GIF file is now ready to get uploaded on the internet.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview gifs GIF combining maker"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change image settings</p>
<p>After finalizing the best preview for your edited files, you can hit the file menu option and then save your project for device or web option. It will immediately open a dialogue box where users can easily specify their image quality and loop count details. Never forget to have one more preview before saving the final results.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="looping counts to combine"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Save your project</p>
<p>As now you are done with all the editing tasks so it is time to hit the “Save” option and then provide your destination address to the modified file. Your animated GIF file is now ready to get uploaded on the internet.</p>
