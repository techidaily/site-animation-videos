<p>When we talk about motion, it makes us think about moves, but it refers to step motion when speaking about still-motion. So, in simple words, <strong>still motion animation</strong> refers to the animation that holds picture-to-picture motion animation.</p>
<p>This article covers all the relevant information related to <strong>still motion animation</strong>, paper motion animation, liquid motion animation. The name may vary, but such motions come under stop motion or <strong>still motion</strong> techniques to a great extent. That uses picture after picture or stopping camera process from reflecting animation to any inanimate objects or things. Under paper motion animation, images are adjusted in such a manner that results in continual animation reflection.</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2. Create a Storyboard"></a>02<strong>Step 2. Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

<h3 id="03Step-3-Draw-Characters"><a href="#03Step-3-Draw-Characters" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Draw Characters"></a>03<strong>Step 3. Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

Put Together Project</strong></h3><p>Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That’s also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go</p>
<p>In the image below, we’re only showing the start of a potential project. We’ve only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video</p>

Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more. Be warned, it’s not the kind of project you should go into if you’re not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Still, there’s something satisfying about a well-done <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated-1"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more. Be warned, it’s not the kind of project you should go into if you’re not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Still, there’s something satisfying about a well-done <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Selecting your favorite photos</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>making a collage in photoshop</strong> is to select all the photos you would like your collage to have. Now, it will be best for you to choose your photos wisely. We understand that each photograph is equally sweet and cherishable. But, when you select the images for your collage in a thoughtful manner, the collage turns out much better than expected.</p>
<p>You can use different <strong>collage ideas for photoshop</strong>, such as following a particular storyline, where you collage the photos so that it recreates the memory or the moments in sequence. Another way to select your photos is by sticking to a particular theme, and it can be vintage or on one specific color or the like. It will help your collage turn out in the best and the most thoughtful way.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Opening the photos you have selected, in collage maker photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have selected which images you would want your collage to have, the next step will require you to open those images in the <strong>collage maker Photoshop</strong>. For this, you will have to select the option “File”. There, you will find the option “Open”. Then you will open the images you have chosen in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Also, you can simply press the “ctrl” and the “O” keys on your keyboard and it will automatically help you open the images you have selected for the <strong>photo collage on photoshop</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-2.jpg"
                      alt="new image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way to open the pages you have selected for your collage is through the “Drag and Drop” function. It is more effortless to choose the images and open them in Photoshop. After you have opened the photos in Photoshop, it will open in a different tab and look like in the following picture.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-3.jpg"
                      alt="open photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Make a new file for your collage on photoshop</strong></p>
<p>The third step requires you to make a new file for your <strong>photo collage in photoshop</strong>. For this, you need to select or click on the “File” option on Photoshop. Then, click on the “New” option. It will help you make a new file for your collage. You can also select the “ctrl” and “N” together.</p>
<p>As you click on the “New” option, you will be given options to choose from. Choose the one that matches your preference.</p>
<p>When you are working on photoshop to make a collage, the images will need a collage background because it is on this background that the photos will assemble. If you have made a collage before on photoshop, you can use the old <strong>collage photoshop template</strong>. Otherwise, you need to create a new document for the collage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-4.jpg"
                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-8.jpg"
                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-9.jpg"
                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-11.jpg"
                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>

<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Selecting your favorite photos</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>making a collage in photoshop</strong> is to select all the photos you would like your collage to have. Now, it will be best for you to choose your photos wisely. We understand that each photograph is equally sweet and cherishable. But, when you select the images for your collage in a thoughtful manner, the collage turns out much better than expected.</p>
<p>You can use different <strong>collage ideas for photoshop</strong>, such as following a particular storyline, where you collage the photos so that it recreates the memory or the moments in sequence. Another way to select your photos is by sticking to a particular theme, and it can be vintage or on one specific color or the like. It will help your collage turn out in the best and the most thoughtful way.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Opening the photos you have selected, in collage maker photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have selected which images you would want your collage to have, the next step will require you to open those images in the <strong>collage maker Photoshop</strong>. For this, you will have to select the option “File”. There, you will find the option “Open”. Then you will open the images you have chosen in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Also, you can simply press the “ctrl” and the “O” keys on your keyboard and it will automatically help you open the images you have selected for the <strong>photo collage on photoshop</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="new image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way to open the pages you have selected for your collage is through the “Drag and Drop” function. It is more effortless to choose the images and open them in Photoshop. After you have opened the photos in Photoshop, it will open in a different tab and look like in the following picture.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-3.jpg"
                      alt="open photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Make a new file for your collage on photoshop</strong></p>
<p>The third step requires you to make a new file for your <strong>photo collage in photoshop</strong>. For this, you need to select or click on the “File” option on Photoshop. Then, click on the “New” option. It will help you make a new file for your collage. You can also select the “ctrl” and “N” together.</p>
<p>As you click on the “New” option, you will be given options to choose from. Choose the one that matches your preference.</p>
<p>When you are working on photoshop to make a collage, the images will need a collage background because it is on this background that the photos will assemble. If you have made a collage before on photoshop, you can use the old <strong>collage photoshop template</strong>. Otherwise, you need to create a new document for the collage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-4.jpg"
                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-8.jpg"
                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-9.jpg"
                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-10.jpg"
                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-11.jpg"
                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>

<p>Our list of the top 8 beats places to download <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>. You may get a lot of <strong>GIF libraries free</strong> by visiting these websites. These websites allow animated GIFs for various purposes, including personal, educational, and commercial ones. You can use the GIFs you download on your websites, blogs, presentations, and emails, among other things. The most excellent part about most of these websites is that you don’t have to pay anything or give them credit in exchange for royalty-free GIFs. These websites include trendy and attractive GIFs, while others only have older royalty-free GIFs. The GIFs on these websites are similarly free of any watermark.</p>
<p>There are numerous websites to download <strong>royalty GIFs</strong> with stock sound effects and photographs. However, when it comes to <strong>copyright-free GIFs</strong>, only a few websites offer them up for download. So, after spending a much time on the internet, I’ve found five websites that can assist you in doing the same. Two of the websites, “Best Animations” and “Animate It,” only enable you to use the GIFs you download for personal use.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-GIFs-Royalty-Free"><a href="#Part-1-Is-GIFs-Royalty-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?"></a>Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?</h2><p>There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies’ use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.</p>
<p>The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, “Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are “stolen” from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?</strong></h2><p>All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not <strong>copyright-free GIFs.</strong> However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.

<p>Our list of the top 8 beats places to download <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>. You may get a lot of <strong>GIF libraries free</strong> by visiting these websites. These websites allow animated GIFs for various purposes, including personal, educational, and commercial ones. You can use the GIFs you download on your websites, blogs, presentations, and emails, among other things. The most excellent part about most of these websites is that you don’t have to pay anything or give them credit in exchange for royalty-free GIFs. These websites include trendy and attractive GIFs, while others only have older royalty-free GIFs. The GIFs on these websites are similarly free of any watermark.</p>
<p>There are numerous websites to download <strong>royalty GIFs</strong> with stock sound effects and photographs. However, when it comes to <strong>copyright-free GIFs</strong>, only a few websites offer them up for download. So, after spending a much time on the internet, I’ve found five websites that can assist you in doing the same. Two of the websites, “Best Animations” and “Animate It,” only enable you to use the GIFs you download for personal use.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-GIFs-Royalty-Free-1"><a href="#Part-1-Is-GIFs-Royalty-Free-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?"></a>Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?</h2><p>There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies’ use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.</p>
<p>The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, “Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are “stolen” from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use-1"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?</strong></h2><p>All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not <strong>copyright-free GIFs.</strong> However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.

<p>The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, “Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are “stolen” from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)</p>

<p>GIF Camera, GIF Maker or GIF Creator are just a few among countless apps that allow Android users to make GIFs, although some of them place limits on the maximum duration of a GIF. In addition, most of these apps are equipped with filters and effects that can be easily applied to a GIF.</p>

<p>If the issue persists, you should update the OS to Android 7.1 or later, because previous versions of the OS may experience difficulties displaying GIF files.</p>

Is It Possible To Create Gifs From An Android Device?"></a>1. Is It Possible To Create Gifs From An Android Device?</h4><p>Recording a GIF with a camera on an Android phone is not possible unless you install a third-party app. There a lot of GIF apps for Android to choose from that enable you to create GIFs directly from your phone.</p>
<p>GIF Camera, GIF Maker or GIF Creator are just a few among countless apps that allow Android users to make GIFs, although some of them place limits on the maximum duration of a GIF. In addition, most of these apps are equipped with filters and effects that can be easily applied to a GIF.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-To-Add-Text-To-A-GIF-From-An-Android-Phone-1"><a href="#2-How-To-Add-Text-To-A-GIF-From-An-Android-Phone-1" class="headerlink" title="2. How To Add Text To A GIF From An Android Phone?"></a>2. How To Add Text To A GIF From An Android Phone?</h4><p>In case the app you are using to record a GIF with an Android phone doesn’t offer text tools you will have to use a video editing app to add text to a GIF you created. However, most GIF apps are equipped with at least basic text editing tools that enable you to apply text layers over the animated GIFs you create with them.</p>
<p>After you launch a GIF app and record a new GIF, you can use the text tool to insert the text you want to include in a GIF and to adjust its position, size, or color.</p>

Why Can’t I Preview Gifs On My Android Phone?"></a>3. Why Can’t I Preview Gifs On My Android Phone?</h4><p>Android OS has had compatibility issues with GIF files for years, as nearly all versions of the OS don’t offer native support for GIFs. In case you are having trouble previewing a GIF file from an Android device, you should try restarting it in order to make sure that some unrelated issue isn’t causing the lagging.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, you should update the OS to Android 7.1 or later, because previous versions of the OS may experience difficulties displaying GIF files.</p>
