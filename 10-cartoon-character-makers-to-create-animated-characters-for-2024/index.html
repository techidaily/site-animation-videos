Find a reference in the real world"></a>1. Find a reference in the real world</h3><p>This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

<h3 id="2-Observe-real-life"><a href="#2-Observe-real-life" class="headerlink" title="2. Observe real life"></a>2. Observe real life</h3><p>The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

<h3 id="3-Simplicity-is-the-key"><a href="#3-Simplicity-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="3. Simplicity is the key"></a>3. Simplicity is the key</h3><p>2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.</p>

Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>

Find a reference in the real world"></a>1. Find a reference in the real world</h3><p>This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

<h3 id="2-Observe-real-life-1"><a href="#2-Observe-real-life-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Observe real life"></a>2. Observe real life</h3><p>The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

Find a reference in the real world"></a>1. Find a reference in the real world</h3><p>This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

<h3 id="2-Observe-real-life-2"><a href="#2-Observe-real-life-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Observe real life"></a>2. Observe real life</h3><p>The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

<h3 id="3-Simplicity-is-the-key-2"><a href="#3-Simplicity-is-the-key-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Simplicity is the key"></a>3. Simplicity is the key</h3><p>2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.</p>

<h3 id="4-Draw-animation-again-and-again-2"><a href="#4-Draw-animation-again-and-again-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Draw animation again and again"></a>4. Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can’t be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.</p>
<p>In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can’t master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.</p>

It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.</p>

<h3 id="6-Carefully-use-keyframing-2"><a href="#6-Carefully-use-keyframing-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Carefully use keyframing"></a>6. Carefully use keyframing</h3><p>3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The keyframes in 3D animation videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.</p>

Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.</p>
<p>This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.</p>

<h3 id="8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation-2"><a href="#8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="8. Take the rhythm in animation"></a>8. Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>

<h3 id="9-Basic-model-2"><a href="#9-Basic-model-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Basic model"></a>9. Basic model</h3><p>You may see your system working too hard when you use a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/" >high-res model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.</p>

<h3 id="10-Use-‘shark-fin’-2"><a href="#10-Use-‘shark-fin’-2" class="headerlink" title="10. Use ‘shark fin’"></a>10. Use ‘shark fin’</h3><p>This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.</p>

Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can’t be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.</p>
<p>In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can’t master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.</p>

<h3 id="8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation-3"><a href="#8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Take the rhythm in animation"></a>8. Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>

When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.</p>

<p>This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of <strong>animate rigging</strong></p>
<p>To help them out (as well as other <strong>animation rigging</strong> beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!</p>

This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

<h3 id="02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging"><a href="#02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging"></a>02<strong>An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>
<h3 id="04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving"><a href="#04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving" class="headerlink" title="04Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving"></a>04<strong>Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving</strong></h3><p>Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Animate-Rigging"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Animate-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Animate Rigging?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do You Animate Rigging?</strong></h2><p>Now, onto actually talking about how you can start <strong>animate rigging</strong>. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>
<h3 id="02Beginners-Tutorial-on-Shape-Rigging"><a href="#02Beginners-Tutorial-on-Shape-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging"></a>02<strong>Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging</strong></h3><p>This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:</p>
<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

<h3 id="03How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works"><a href="#03How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works" class="headerlink" title="03How Auto Rig Mapping Works"></a>03<strong>How Auto Rig Mapping Works</strong></h3><p>Auto-rigging is the use of pre-made rigs in order to simplify the process. The tool automatically maps the areas where the characters and the rig are given the same symbol names and snaps them together to create joints for a motion to be applied.</p>
<h3 id="04How-Visual-Rig-Mapping-Works"><a href="#04How-Visual-Rig-Mapping-Works" class="headerlink" title="04How Visual Rig Mapping Works"></a>04<strong>How Visual Rig Mapping Works</strong></h3><p>Visual mapping is a lot more complicated the auto-rig mapping, so it’s not something you want to jump into immediately. However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>Manually make connections starting with the joints.</p>
<p>Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.</p>
<p>Motion can then be added to the timeline.</p>

<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-1"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-1"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>

<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>

This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-1"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>

<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>Manually make connections starting with the joints.</p>
<p>Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.</p>
<p>Motion can then be added to the timeline.</p>

<p>This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of <strong>animate rigging</strong></p>
<p>To help them out (as well as other <strong>animation rigging</strong> beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!</p>

This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-3"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

<h3 id="02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging-3"><a href="#02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging"></a>02<strong>An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-3"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>
<h3 id="04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving-3"><a href="#04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving-3" class="headerlink" title="04Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving"></a>04<strong>Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving</strong></h3><p>Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Animate-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Animate-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Animate Rigging?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do You Animate Rigging?</strong></h2><p>Now, onto actually talking about how you can start <strong>animate rigging</strong>. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-3"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>
<h3 id="02Beginners-Tutorial-on-Shape-Rigging-3"><a href="#02Beginners-Tutorial-on-Shape-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging"></a>02<strong>Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging</strong></h3><p>This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:</p>
<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>

And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation"><a href="#02Anticipation" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing"><a href="#04Timing" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun"><a href="#01It-is-fun" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression"><a href="#02Lasting-impression" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget"><a href="#01Budget" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience"><a href="#03Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market"><a href="#04Market" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-1"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-1" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-1"><a href="#03Target-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-1"><a href="#04Market-1" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-1"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-1" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation"></a>Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation</h2><p>Animators follow a list of strict principles to create the most inspiring projects. And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch-2"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch-2" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation-2"><a href="#02Anticipation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out-2"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out-2" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                      alt="ease in animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing-2"><a href="#04Timing-2" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing-2"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing-2" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun-2"><a href="#01It-is-fun-2" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-2"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-2" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-2"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-2" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>

However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-2"><a href="#01Budget-2" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work.

<h3 id="01It-is-fun-3"><a href="#01It-is-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-3"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-3" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-3"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-3" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-3"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-3"><a href="#01Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-3"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-3" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-3"><a href="#03Target-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-3"><a href="#04Market-3" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
