<p><strong>●</strong> Take Care of the File Size</p>
<p>The credibility of LinkedIn carousel posts lies in the engaging presentation of your static and monotonous text to make them stand out of the crowded newsfeed. True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a Commendable File Format</p>
<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make a Careful Upload</p>
<p>When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bonus Tip</p>
<p>To include the latest and up-to-date information within your presentation, consider visiting the LinkedIn official webpage directly from your platform account.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Take Care of the File Size</p>
<p>The credibility of LinkedIn carousel posts lies in the engaging presentation of your static and monotonous text to make them stand out of the crowded newsfeed. True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a Commendable File Format</p>
<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make a Careful Upload</p>
<p>When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bonus Tip</p>
<p>To include the latest and up-to-date information within your presentation, consider visiting the LinkedIn official webpage directly from your platform account.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Avoid reference material</strong></p>
<p>Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn’t have the reference material right in front of you as you work.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make research on other characters</strong></p>
<p>For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Also, take a look elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character’s posture or idea’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Try not to lose sight of the original idea</strong></p>
<p>It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.</p>

<p>When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters’ essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Decide the aim of your character design</strong></p>
<p>When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your ‘thing.’ Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make your character distinctive</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create clear silhouettes</strong></p>
<p>A silhouette is required to help you understand the character’s gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character ‘reads’ and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Consider line quality</strong></p>
<p>Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.</p>

<p>Making an overall excellent and unique <strong>character design cartoon art style</strong> is sometimes hard.

They are;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Do not lose the magic</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.</p>
<p>The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.</p>

                      alt="cartoon character design tips 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Avoid reference material</strong></p>
<p>Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn’t have the reference material right in front of you as you work.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make research on other characters</strong></p>
<p>For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Also, take a look elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character’s posture or idea’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Try not to lose sight of the original idea</strong></p>
<p>It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Exaggerate</strong></p>
<p>When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters’ essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Decide the aim of your character design</strong></p>
<p>When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your ‘thing.’ Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make your character distinctive</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create clear silhouettes</strong></p>
<p>A silhouette is required to help you understand the character’s gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character ‘reads’ and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Consider line quality</strong></p>
<p>Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.</p>

This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it’s also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You’ll have to be extra cautious while picking through the <strong>best 2D animation studios</strong>.</p>

In layman’s terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can’t be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).</p>
<p>Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it’s always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it’s also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You’ll have to be extra cautious while picking through the <strong>best 2D animation studios</strong>.</p>

Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated <strong>2D animation company</strong>, you’ll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don’t know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.</p>

Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>

Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?"></a>Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?</h2><p>To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script-3"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/write-a-script.JPG"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Start-with-the-Storyboard-3"><a href="#Step-2-Start-with-the-Storyboard-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start with the Storyboard"></a>Step 2: Start with the Storyboard</h4><p>Now you have a script. You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboard.JPG"
                      alt="storyboard"
                ></p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Create-Images-3"><a href="#Step-3-Create-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create Images"></a>Step 3: Create Images</h4><p>If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-image.JPG"
                      alt="create image"
                ></p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Animate-Those-Images-3"><a href="#Step-4-Animate-Those-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Animate Those Images"></a>Step 4: Animate Those Images</h4><p>Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animate drawing"
                ></p>
<h4 id="Step-5-Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3"><a href="#Step-5-Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio"></a>Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio</h4><p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Part-3：Useful-Tips-for-Creating-Whiteboard-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-3：Useful-Tips-for-Creating-Whiteboard-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation"></a>Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation</h2><h4 id="Evoke-Empathy-3"><a href="#Evoke-Empathy-3" class="headerlink" title="Evoke Empathy"></a>Evoke Empathy</h4><p>The goal of a whiteboard animation video is not just to explain information in a cold and impersonal way. You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.</p>
<p>By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.</p>
<h4 id="Personalize-the-Images-3"><a href="#Personalize-the-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Personalize the Images"></a>Personalize the Images</h4><p>Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project. And if you are wondering how you will edit your video, we recommend <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
