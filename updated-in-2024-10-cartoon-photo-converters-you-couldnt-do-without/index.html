<p>02 [Step by Step to Help You Understand 2D&#x2F;3D Character Design](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Animate-Character-Design"><a href="#01Animate-Character-Design" class="headerlink" title="01Animate Character Design"></a>01Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are some steps involved in the designing a character for animation. And those steps are pretty diverse. So, we have enlisted all the required steps and factors to help you learn and understand character designing for animation. The list is as follows.</p>
<h3 id="02Understanding-your-audience"><a href="#02Understanding-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="02Understanding your audience"></a>02Understanding your audience</h3><p>To create the best character design, it is essential that you understand your target audience. If your target audience includes the kids and the children, your character design will primarily be based on cartoons.</p>
<p>Ensure which genre of animation does your audience prefer? If it is funny or mythological or any other genre, you design your characters accordingly.</p>

Different types serve different purposes and genres. So, let us know about the different types of animations, and this will help you understand which one would suit your requirements.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Pop-style Characters</strong></p>
<p>The characters you see in the comics and superhero animation movies are pop-style characters. They are highly expressive, become the centre of attraction and always are dominant on the screen. They tend to deliver an energy that reaches the audience impeccably.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="pop style character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Iconic design</strong></p>
<p>These characters are less fancy but highly expressive. They usually have a block face yet connect to an audience of all types. They are generally best for the corporate videos and those with some messages to be delivered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iconic design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Editorial Style Characters</strong></p>
<p>These characters are highly elegant and bold. These are characters that we see in different publications. They consist of great style, realisticity and cleanliness. They are mainly used to express the quality of presence.</p>

                      alt="editorial design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sketch and experiment</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know about the different character types, it will help you understand which one would match the genre of animation you prefer to work on. So, start sketching your imagination in a draft.</p>
<p>Decide on the different poses your character might have. Track them down in a draft. It helps you become organised and put down your plan and creativity collectively.</p>
<p>Trial and error are one of the best ways to achieve perfection. So, it is crucial to sketch and then take feedback. If they do not appear praiseworthy, continue sketching and then get feedback again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animate and execute</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be best to execute all your drafts and imaginations. Try using the animation tools that suit your skill capacity and genre of animation the best.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Animate-Character-Design-1"><a href="#01Animate-Character-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="01Animate Character Design"></a>01Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are some steps involved in the designing a character for animation.

Different types serve different purposes and genres. So, let us know about the different types of animations, and this will help you understand which one would suit your requirements.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Pop-style Characters</strong></p>
<p>The characters you see in the comics and superhero animation movies are pop-style characters. They are highly expressive, become the centre of attraction and always are dominant on the screen. They tend to deliver an energy that reaches the audience impeccably.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="pop style character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Iconic design</strong></p>
<p>These characters are less fancy but highly expressive. They usually have a block face yet connect to an audience of all types. They are generally best for the corporate videos and those with some messages to be delivered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iconic design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Editorial Style Characters</strong></p>
<p>These characters are highly elegant and bold. These are characters that we see in different publications. They consist of great style, realisticity and cleanliness. They are mainly used to express the quality of presence.</p>

                      alt="editorial design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sketch and experiment</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know about the different character types, it will help you understand which one would match the genre of animation you prefer to work on. So, start sketching your imagination in a draft.</p>
<p>Decide on the different poses your character might have. Track them down in a draft. It helps you become organised and put down your plan and creativity collectively.</p>
<p>Trial and error are one of the best ways to achieve perfection. So, it is crucial to sketch and then take feedback. If they do not appear praiseworthy, continue sketching and then get feedback again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animate and execute</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be best to execute all your drafts and imaginations. Try using the animation tools that suit your skill capacity and genre of animation the best.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Character-Design-1"><a href="#04Animate-Character-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Character Design"></a>04Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are five simple steps that will help you animate a character design in 3D. The steps are as follows.</p>

<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool"><a href="#01Brush-Tool" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool"><a href="#03Pen-Tool" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-1"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-1"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-1" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-1"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-2"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-2"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-2" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-2"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-3"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-3"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-3" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-3"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>
