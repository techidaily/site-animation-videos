It’s a very open subject.</p>
<h3 id="01GIFs-Are-Easy-to-Share-Ads"><a href="#01GIFs-Are-Easy-to-Share-Ads" class="headerlink" title="01GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads"></a>01<strong>GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads</strong></h3><p>The best part of GIFs is that they are easily consumable media that you can share just about everywhere. For example, you can include them in your email marketing to bring a little life to what could have otherwise been a very dry message You can also have it play out on social media without prompting (different from videos, which the user usually has to play before it starts going.)</p>

Eye-catching in a way that keeps you looking to catch the movement — in compared to if you were just looking at a still image (which might catch your attention for a moment, but usually bores you the next)</p>

Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving’ pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.</p>

Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example. With just one look, you can probably create an entire story in your head about the woman that is featured This can be very useful for future marketing prospects.</p>

Only, it’s a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below</p>

Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving’ pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.</p>

It offers a full-scale editing panel and a plethora of features that allow designers to create visually enticing 3D animations for videos, games, and marketing purposes. But, can you use Blender to create 2D animations? Even though the tool is marketed as a 3D animation creator, it’s worth noting that one can use it for 2D animations as well. Now, the process may not be as straightforward as using a dedicated 2D animation creator, you can still get the job done using Blender. This will be pretty helpful if you are already a Blender user and want to create 2D animations for a project.</p>
<p>To help you along the way, we have put together a detailed guide on how to create Blender 2D animations and use them in your videos to make them look more stunning. So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p>

Its worldwide popularity is clear proof of what one can achieve while creating a 3D animation with Blender. But, the real question is - are Blender 2D animations as good as their 3D alternatives. Well, the answer is Yes! Blender has a built-in feature known as Grease Pencil that’s specifically designed to create 2D animations. With Grease Pencil, you can create different 2D layouts from scratch and turn them into visually appealing animations to engage the potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?"></a>Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?</h2><p>So, how can you create 2D animations in Blender? Well, it depends! The process to create a 2D animation in Blender mainly depends on what you want to design. You can find different Blender 2D animation tutorials on YouTube and use them to get started with 2D animations in Blender. But, we would like to point out that there’s a generic process that’ll remain consistent in every situation. If you are also getting started with creating 2D animations in Blender, here’s the step-by-step process that’ll help you start sailing in the right direction and make the 2D animation designing a hassle-free task.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>First and foremost, launch Blender on your system and set it up to get started. On the home screen, click on “File&gt;New” and then, select “2D Animation”.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="design image blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.</p>
<h5 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5"><a href="#Step-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 5"></a>Step 5</h5><p>Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you’ve drawn on the screen and then, select “Rotation and Scale”.

<p>Our topic for today’s article is on that exact same subject. Or, rather, more specifically, <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who want more than the usual robotic text-to-speech AI that you see in more professional software. Learn more about all this below, we’ve prepared an entire guide for you!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Most-Realistic-Sounding-Text-to-Speech-How-to-Do-It"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Most-Realistic-Sounding-Text-to-Speech-How-to-Do-It" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech &amp; How to Do It?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech &amp; How to Do It?</strong></h2><p>To start off, we’ve included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:</p>
<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube"></a>Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube</h2><p>If you want to create your own <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Reading Speed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel &gt; Speech page for the option to apply it there.</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier"><a href="#01Flixier" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Flixier Online Video Editor"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord"><a href="#02Woord" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

                      alt="Woord"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Speechelo"><a href="#03Speechelo" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A wide variety of voice options to choose from.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05TTS-Reader"><a href="#05TTS-Reader" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available to use online for FREE.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of different voice options.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>

For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-1"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-1" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel &gt; Speech page for the option to apply it there.</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier-1"><a href="#01Flixier-1" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>

                      alt="Flixier Online Video Editor"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord-1"><a href="#02Woord-1" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Speechelo-1"><a href="#03Speechelo-1" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4-1"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4-1" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A wide variety of voice options to choose from.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05TTS-Reader-1"><a href="#05TTS-Reader-1" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available to use online for FREE.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable speed for voice.</p>

<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier-2"><a href="#01Flixier-2" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord-2"><a href="#02Woord-2" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

<h3 id="03Speechelo-2"><a href="#03Speechelo-2" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4-2"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4-2" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A wide variety of voice options to choose from.</p>

<h3 id="05TTS-Reader-2"><a href="#05TTS-Reader-2" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available to use online for FREE.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable speed for voice.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you’ll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, you’ll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.</p>

Starting with:</p>
<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-3"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-3" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-3"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-3" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>

For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

<h3 id="02Woord-3"><a href="#02Woord-3" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

<h3 id="03Speechelo-3"><a href="#03Speechelo-3" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4-3"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4-3" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>

<h3 id="05TTS-Reader-3"><a href="#05TTS-Reader-3" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
