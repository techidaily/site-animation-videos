<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Draw-Captain-America"><a href="#02How-to-Draw-Captain-America" class="headerlink" title="02How to Draw Captain America"></a>02How to Draw Captain America</h3><p>Follow these simple steps to make a Disney cartoon drawing of Captain America:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

                      alt="draw the head and chest"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Draw his arm and waist</p>
<p>Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.</p>

                      alt="sketch his waist and arm"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Draw his legs</p>
<p>Here, we shall portray Captain America in action. Use curved lines to show his extended right leg with boots. The left leg should appear more petite.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Draw his shield</p>
<p>Against his right arm, carefully draw a flattened circular shape. You can achieve this by drawing concentric circles with a large star in the middle. Draw his arm poking out from behind his shield.</p>

                      alt="draw a circle for its head"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Using a long curved line, draw an irregular peanut shape beneath the head to represent its body.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="draw its underbelly and chest"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Draw Stitch’s arm using curved lines for the upper arm and another pair for the lower arm. Draw his bent hands and fingers using short lines. At the tip of its fingers, draw small pointed triangles to represent its claws.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead.

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Draw his arm and waist</p>
<p>Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Using a long curved line, draw an irregular peanut shape beneath the head to represent its body.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Draw Stitch’s outstretched arm using a pair of curved lines and small “C” shaped lines to represent the fingers. Use short lines to connect the fingers. Draw small “V” shapes at the tip of the fingers for the triangular claws.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other.

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation"><a href="#023D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation-2"><a href="#023D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Top 10 3D Text Animation Templates ](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png"
                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles"><a href="#09Bold-Titles" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you don’t have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> SECRET TIP! If you’re looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It’s a video editor, first and foremost, but that’s not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>

<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>

<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>

Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-2"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-2" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal-2"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal-2" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-2"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-2"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-2" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-2"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-2" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-2"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-2" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-2"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-2" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements.

<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-2"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-2" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-2"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-2" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-2"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you.

Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well.

A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation.

Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation.

<p>But, if you are someone who wants to get into animation, but don’t have an expensive budget, claymations can be a great tool to share your story with the world and attract a global audience. In this guide, we are going to talk about claymations, some of the most popular claymation websites, and the best ways to get started with <strong>stop motion claymation</strong>.

By the end of this guide, you’ll be running out to buy clay and make some high-quality <strong>clay stop-motion animations</strong>.</p>

<p>03 [Best 5 Clay for Stop Motion and Ways to Get Started](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone-3"><a href="#Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone"></a>Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone</h2><p>So, now that you are familiar with the basic concept of <strong>clay stop animation</strong>, let’s understand how you can get started with claymation animations. Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Edit-a-Stop-Motion-Claymation-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Edit-a-Stop-Motion-Claymation-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation"></a>Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation</h2><p>At this point, you would have several hundred photographs and a script in mind to make your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong>. So, the next part would be to turn these raw images into an animation. To do this, you can use different types of video editing applications. However, we recommend using Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.</p>

<p>Here’s a quick recap of all the features that make Wondershare Filmora an ideal video editing software for <strong>stop motion claymation animation</strong>.</p>
