<p>Animation is a skill that you need years to practice. However, the learning process can be boosted if you master some animation tips. If you’re looking for great 2D&#x2F;3D animation tips and tricks, this is what we will offer here.</p>
<p>There are some overlaps between 2D and 3D animation tips like practicing and object pose, but in essence, animation tips can be learned commonly.</p>
<p>These animation tips will help you make your 2D and 3D animations as bold and creative as possible, while reduce your workload and enable you to get your work out into the world quicker with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >excellent animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Find a reference in the real world"></a>1. Find a reference in the real world</h3><p>This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

<h3 id="2-Observe-real-life"><a href="#2-Observe-real-life" class="headerlink" title="2. Observe real life"></a>2. Observe real life</h3><p>The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

<h3 id="3-Simplicity-is-the-key"><a href="#3-Simplicity-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="3. Simplicity is the key"></a>3. Simplicity is the key</h3><p>2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.</p>

<h3 id="4-Draw-animation-again-and-again"><a href="#4-Draw-animation-again-and-again" class="headerlink" title="4. Draw animation again and again"></a>4. Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can’t be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.</p>
<p>In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can’t master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.</p>

It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.</p>

In this case, you need more tips and tricks.</p>
<h3 id="6-Carefully-use-keyframing"><a href="#6-Carefully-use-keyframing" class="headerlink" title="6. Carefully use keyframing"></a>6. Carefully use keyframing</h3><p>3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The keyframes in 3D animation videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.</p>

<h3 id="7-Evaluate-constructive-criticism"><a href="#7-Evaluate-constructive-criticism" class="headerlink" title="7. Evaluate constructive criticism"></a>7.

Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.</p>
<p>This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.</p>

<h3 id="8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation"><a href="#8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation" class="headerlink" title="8. Take the rhythm in animation"></a>8. Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="9-Basic-model"><a href="#9-Basic-model" class="headerlink" title="9. Basic model"></a>9. Basic model</h3><p>You may see your system working too hard when you use a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/" >high-res model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.</p>

<h3 id="10-Use-‘shark-fin’"><a href="#10-Use-‘shark-fin’" class="headerlink" title="10. Use ‘shark fin’"></a>10. Use ‘shark fin’</h3><p>This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.</p>

When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.</p>

For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.</p>
<p>In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can’t master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.</p>

Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>

When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.</p>

A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.</p>

Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>

When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.</p>

A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.</p>

Find a reference in the real world"></a>1. Find a reference in the real world</h3><p>This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

<h3 id="2-Observe-real-life-3"><a href="#2-Observe-real-life-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Observe real life"></a>2. Observe real life</h3><p>The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

<h3 id="3-Simplicity-is-the-key-3"><a href="#3-Simplicity-is-the-key-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Simplicity is the key"></a>3. Simplicity is the key</h3><p>2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.</p>

<h3 id="4-Draw-animation-again-and-again-3"><a href="#4-Draw-animation-again-and-again-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Draw animation again and again"></a>4. Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can’t be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.</p>
<p>In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can’t master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.</p>

<p>This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.</p>

<p>Canva is a graphic design platform that allows users to create stunning designs for social media posts, presentations, assignments, recipe cards, birthday videos.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Canva’s animation feature, a whole new world of possibilities are open to the public. Also, with pre-designed templates from professional designers, content creation has never been easier than Canva.</p>
<p>Animations themselves have the option of being individually customized element by element. Canva animated graphics makes it easy to unleash your creative potential.</p>
<p>This article will explore how to animate graphics in Canva that can suit every occasion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Animate Your Graphic In Canva](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Make A Moving Graphic In Canva](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [Pricing for Canva You Should Know](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva</h2><p>People can create animations in Canva in one of two ways. You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>
<p>● A4 Documents</p>
<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>
<p>● YouTube Thumbnails</p>
<p>● Presentation</p>
<p>● Flyer&#x2F;Poster</p>
<p>● Instagram Logo</p>
<p>● Infographic</p>
<p>These options generate the ability to be presented in both portrait and landscape mode. The multitude of options makes it an ideal medium for you to create your animation. The animation options at Canva also come with the opportunity to animate an existing image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-1.png"
                      alt="Free Animated Presentation"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-3.png"
                      alt="Animating Images in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva"><a href="#2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?"></a>2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?</h3><p>Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva"><a href="#2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?"></a>2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?</h3><p>Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-5.png"
                      alt="Video Animation in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Pricing-for-Canva-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Part-3-Pricing-for-Canva-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Pricing for Canva You Should Know"></a>Part 3 Pricing for Canva You Should Know</h2><p>Canva can be used among a multitude of users and companies.

<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-1"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-1"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>

<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>

The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva-3"><a href="#Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva</h2><p>People can create animations in Canva in one of two ways. You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>
<p>● A4 Documents</p>
<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>
<p>● YouTube Thumbnails</p>
<p>● Presentation</p>
<p>● Flyer&#x2F;Poster</p>
<p>● Instagram Logo</p>
<p>● Infographic</p>
<p>These options generate the ability to be presented in both portrait and landscape mode. The multitude of options makes it an ideal medium for you to create your animation. The animation options at Canva also come with the opportunity to animate an existing image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-1.png"
                      alt="Free Animated Presentation"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-3"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-3"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva-3"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-3.png"
                      alt="Animating Images in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva-3"><a href="#2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?"></a>2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?</h3><p>Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva-3"><a href="#2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?"></a>2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?</h3><p>Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-5.png"
                      alt="Video Animation in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>
