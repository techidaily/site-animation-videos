<h2 id="Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video"><a href="#Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?"></a>Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?</h2><p>To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why?

<h2 id="Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?"></a>Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?</h2><p>To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script-3"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-Create-Images-3"><a href="#Step-3-Create-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create Images"></a>Step 3: Create Images</h4><p>If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.</p>

<h4 id="Step-4-Animate-Those-Images-3"><a href="#Step-4-Animate-Those-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Animate Those Images"></a>Step 4: Animate Those Images</h4><p>Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.</p>

Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.</p>

You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.</p>
<p>By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.</p>
<h4 id="Personalize-the-Images-3"><a href="#Personalize-the-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Personalize the Images"></a>Personalize the Images</h4><p>Showing interesting images is a good start.

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>
<h3 id="01Fred-Flintstone"><a href="#01Fred-Flintstone" class="headerlink" title="01Fred Flintstone"></a>01Fred Flintstone</h3><p><img

                      alt="fred flintstone"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>
<h3 id="02Mickey-Mouse"><a href="#02Mickey-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="02Mickey Mouse"></a>02Mickey Mouse</h3><p><img

                      alt="mickey mouse"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>
<h3 id="03SpongeBob-Squarepants"><a href="#03SpongeBob-Squarepants" class="headerlink" title="03SpongeBob Squarepants"></a>03SpongeBob Squarepants</h3><p><img

                      alt="spongebob squarepant"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>
<h3 id="04Tom-and-Jerry"><a href="#04Tom-and-Jerry" class="headerlink" title="04Tom and Jerry"></a>04Tom and Jerry</h3><p><img

                      alt="tom and jerry"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>
<h3 id="05Homer-Simpson"><a href="#05Homer-Simpson" class="headerlink" title="05Homer Simpson"></a>05Homer Simpson</h3><p><img

                      alt="homer simpson"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

                      alt="charlie brown and snoopy"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1950<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Charles M. Schulz<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1940<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices</p>
<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1969<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Joe Ruby and Ken Spears<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others</p>
<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2014<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Will Arnett</p>
<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain.

However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1950<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Charles M. Schulz<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1940<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices</p>
<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2014<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Will Arnett</p>
<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference.

<p>There are plenty of things that the 90s have given us. And when we revisit them now, it gives us an inimitable feeling of nostalgia which we would like to store forever with us. And one of the things that can bring back tons of cherished memories from the 90s is the <strong>claymation tv shows</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>claymation shows</strong> were called the clay animation shows. The reason for such a name was because the characters in the shows were made from malleable or deformable materials, especially out of clay. They have been one of the most revolutionary and entertaining components of that time.</p>
<p>These shows were one of the forms among the numerous forms of stop-motion animations. We will cover what these shows were about, their cast, and where you can watch them today. And in the following discussion, we will be discussing the ten best <strong>90s claymation shows</strong> to bring back wonderful nostalgic memories.</p>

Adobe Animate CC, which is basically the new Adobe Flash, has also received an update recently which installed a bundle of new features to its interface, making it even more irresistible to animators.</p>
<p><strong>What’s new with Adobe Animate?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Adobe Animate Camera</strong></p>
<p>Adding to Adobe’s line of exclusivity is its all-new Adobe Virtual Camera. Using this feature, Adobe animate users can now control their animation camera movements giving your animation videos a more realistic feel.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Export any Format</strong></p>
<p>Exporting your animations to your desktop is a convenience every software should provide.</p>

<p>Adobe Animate enables you to synchronize audio to your animations completely easily which is yet another feature that has been recently added.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Vector Brushes</strong></p>
<p>Though it resembles the same functionality with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate has renewed the tool with the ability to use tilt and pressure effects when drawing with a stylus or pen.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Web Fonts</strong></p>
<p>Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.</p>

How Much Do You Know About Adobe Animate Key Features?</h3><p>The Adobe Creative Cloud is constantly updating its range of virtual tools with new features which give users twice more incentive to subscribe. Adobe Animate CC, which is basically the new Adobe Flash, has also received an update recently which installed a bundle of new features to its interface, making it even more irresistible to animators.</p>
<p><strong>What’s new with Adobe Animate?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Adobe Animate Camera</strong></p>
<p>Adding to Adobe’s line of exclusivity is its all-new Adobe Virtual Camera. Using this feature, Adobe animate users can now control their animation camera movements giving your animation videos a more realistic feel.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Export any Format</strong></p>
<p>Exporting your animations to your desktop is a convenience every software should provide.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Audio Syncing</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Animate enables you to synchronize audio to your animations completely easily which is yet another feature that has been recently added.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Vector Brushes</strong></p>
<p>Though it resembles the same functionality with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate has renewed the tool with the ability to use tilt and pressure effects when drawing with a stylus or pen.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Web Fonts</strong></p>
<p>Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.</p>

<p>This becomes an obstacle to those who are just starting out and are not that confident in getting their hands on a professional league interface like Animate. It also lacks sufficient facilities for practicing 3D animations.</p>

</ul>
<p>You’re ready to add in your video once you’ve chosen your template! Upload or select any video you might want to use and drag it into a placeholder on your story chosen template. If needed, adjust the size and positioning until it fits.</p>
<ul>

<p>Another option to animate your social media posts videos is through the Elements feature in Canva by choosing the “Stickers” tab.</p>

</ul>
<p>There’s an “Animate” button you’ll see at the top when you’re in your design. Hit on the page you wish to animate, and the Animate tab will pop up on the top left.</p>
