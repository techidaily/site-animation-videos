<h3 id="10-Tokyo-Ghoul-3"><a href="#10-Tokyo-Ghoul-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Tokyo Ghoul"></a>10. Tokyo Ghoul</h3><p>One of the greatest horror anime series ever, Tokyo Ghoul features an amazing storyline. When the college student Ken falls victim to his ghoul date, he is saved by doctors. But, his rebirth is as a hybrid of humans and ghouls. This horror anime series is not for the faint-hearted as it shows grotesque scenes of body horror as the ghouls devour human flesh. However, Tokyo Ghoul also portrays how Ken is forced to control his flesh-eating desires. Would the hybrid lean more towards his human trait or the evil side? We recommend watching this very scary anime to find out how Ken survives as a hybrid and does he give in to his ghoul nature?</p>
