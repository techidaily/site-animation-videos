<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif14.png"
                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-1"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-1" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>

<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Study the storylines, the hooks, the emotion required for different kinds of scenes. You need to actually know your stuff before you can even start thinking about dubbing any anime. Don’t ever decide to become an anime voice actor if you don’t like animes. Most of the scenes may appear silly to you not to talk of the vocabulary which may just sound weird and annoying to one who is not a fan.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Next, copy the image and paste it back as a picture.</p>

You can then use the picture effects, and other tools present in PowerPoint as mentioned to get your output.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If the target picture has a background, your first step is to isolate it from its background. Remove the background or make it white.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to sharpen the picture by 50%. This is available in the picture corrections effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, copy the image and paste it back as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Repeat these steps four times to make the lines in the image stand out sharply.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, add the color effect of Black and White at 20%.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You will get quite a fairly detailed output.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to sharpen the picture by 50%. This is available in the picture corrections effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, copy the image and paste it back as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Repeat these steps four times to make the lines in the image stand out sharply.</p>

Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>

Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.</p>

You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.</p>
<p>By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.</p>
<h4 id="Personalize-the-Images"><a href="#Personalize-the-Images" class="headerlink" title="Personalize the Images"></a>Personalize the Images</h4><p>Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-8"><a href="#Conclusion-8" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project.

Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>

Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
