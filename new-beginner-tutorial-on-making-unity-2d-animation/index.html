<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg"
                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>

<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>

                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg"
                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="animations in unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.</p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-1.jpg"
                      alt="Construct Pinterest Feed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>
<p>Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Layout and click on ‘Add A Gadget.’</p>
<p>Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.</p>

<p>Click Save and view your blog.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-Multiple-Photos-to-Pinterest"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-Multiple-Photos-to-Pinterest" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest"></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest</strong></h2><p>If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.</p>
<p>When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during <strong>the Pinterest slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Log into your Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see ‘convert to business,’ then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer.

<p><strong>Step 3: Select a Board</strong></p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>

                      alt="Construct Pinterest Feed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>
<p>Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Layout and click on ‘Add A Gadget.’</p>
<p>Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.</p>

Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.</p>
<p>When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during <strong>the Pinterest slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Log into your Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see ‘convert to business,’ then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either ‘png’ or ‘jpeg.’</p>
<p>Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.</p>

<p>When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during <strong>the Pinterest slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Log into your Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see ‘convert to business,’ then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either ‘png’ or ‘jpeg.’</p>
<p>Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Title</strong></p>
<p>Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe’s title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select a Board</strong></p>
<p>The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.</p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Construct Pinterest Feed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>
<p>Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Layout and click on ‘Add A Gadget.’</p>
<p>Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.</p>

Before the 2016 classic, we first meet Dory in the 2003 Pixar’s classic ‘finding Nemo’ where Dory helps Marlin, a clownfish, reunites with his son, Nemo. In ‘Finding Dory, ‘ young Dory’s amnesiac was finally brought back thirteen years later. Dory is perseverant, has a trim physique, and yet she can do whatever she has set her mind to do.</p>

He happens to be Moana’s best friend. Pua made his first appearance during the ‘Where you are’ performance alongside the village chief’s daughter. On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>
