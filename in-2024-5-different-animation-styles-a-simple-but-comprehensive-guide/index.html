But the reality or fact is, due to overexposure to social media sites and technological advancements, we have forgotten its importance. They are on the verge of existence at present. Are you an art lover who wishes to know more about <strong>animation styles</strong>? Want to know some of the software tools that can bring out the artist in you? Here is a complete guide that is all you need.</p>

<h2 id="5-Different-Animation-Styles"><a href="#5-Different-Animation-Styles" class="headerlink" title="5 Different Animation Styles"></a>5 Different Animation Styles</h2><p>Ready to enter into the world of animation along with us? We are all set to take you through a ride of different animation styles, their importance, and some of the videos that one should give a try!</p>
<h4 id="1-2D-Animation"><a href="#1-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="1.  2D Animation"></a>1.  2D Animation</h4><p>Let’s start with 2D as our fist animation style, which is the traditional or oldest form in practice for more than 100 years since 1908. 2D has widely been in usage to create animated short films, cartoon characters, games, marketing videos, and educational materials. In 2D animation, the characters or items, creatures, and backgrounds get crafted in a two-dimensional space. It produces a graphic of movement with the drawings played serially one after another.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: At present, various free animator tools like Creatoon, Blender, and Pencil 2D, whereas, for professionals, Encore, Flash, Toon Boom Harmony, and Adobe Photoshop can be handy!</p>
<p>The above 2D animation style video is a short film “Dark Dark Woods” directed by the students at “The Animation Workshop.” It is all about the young princess, Maria, drenched, and tired of living a royal life being filled with rules, duties, lessons, responsibilities, and customs. One night, she enters into an adventurous event where she finds herself in a mysterious monster-filled dark wood. Watch the film and find did she find out there!</p>
<h4 id="2-3D-Animation"><a href="#2-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="2.  3D Animation"></a>2.  3D Animation</h4><p>As the next version of 2D, in the animation industry, 3D revolutionized the market since its first appearance in 1972. Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.</p>
<p>Do you know how it feels if you are trapped alone on a deserted island? “It’s a Cinch!” is a fantastic, funny 3D short film that is an adventurous movie made by the ESMA team at CGI. For sure, you will like this funny movie all about atrocities happening with a man and a pelican and enjoy it as much as I did!</p>
<h4 id="3-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#3-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="3.  Motion Graphics"></a>3.  Motion Graphics</h4><p>Our next animation style is motion graphics of the animated graphic design, where text appears to be the main enhancing factor. It is a piece of animation or digital footage that illuminates a motion or notation incorporated with audio. It is a new way of communicating to the audience and in driving them deep into the story. You can categorize it under the visual effect technique, which involves the movement of graphic images or elements like logos or text, sound, music, and motion. Motion graphics are best to be found in action and finds a place in multimedia projects, advertising agencies, branding, television title making, and storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: Tools that are best for motion graphics is Mocha AE, After Effects, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D.</p>
<p>The world is a great place, but we always forget another beautiful hidden green world behind the fantastic buildings we reside in. Yes, “Beautiful World” is a motion graphic video by Blasterjaxx &amp; DBSTF feat. Ryder presents how we humans have developed a great empire by destroying the other beautiful part of the world.</p>
<h4 id="4-Stop-Motion"><a href="#4-Stop-Motion" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stop Motion"></a>4.  Stop Motion</h4><p>Stop motion is one of the traditional animation styles that is the most popular filmmaking technique that uses hand-crafted or manipulated objects, mostly clay models. Puppets, silhouettes, and cut-outs can also be implemented as stop motion aids to produce animation. It is labor-intensive, a form of art, and has its flavor in animation, although 3D and visual effects have replaced it quite a long time before. But still, filmmakers like Tim Burton use stop motion in their films, making it to withstand the animation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: You can make your stop motion video with software like Dragon frame, Stop Motion Pro Eclipse, and IKITMovie.</p>
<p>Although stop motion has gone before ages, there is still a fantastic introduction. Here is an award-winning short film, “Tokri (the basket),” which is a clumsy accident that leads a juvenile girl onto Mumbai’s streets with the trust of making things correct. Studio Eeksaurus, an Indian bastion animation company, has depicted a father and daughter’s tender emotive tale.</p>
<h4 id="5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation"><a href="#5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation" class="headerlink" title="5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation"></a>5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation</h4><p>Here is a Paint-on-Glass animation style that is a technique used for making animated films that gives a lot of fun. Artists paint short stories on glasses using oil paints and film them by recording it frame-by-frame. Russian animator Aleksandr Petrov is a famous artist well known for making award-winning paint-on-glass animation. Animators use different objects like brick dust, sand, pastels, and charcoal, to create outstanding drama in their films.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: You can also become a paint-on-glass animator now with tools like Pencil 2D, Blender, Krita, and GIMP.</p>
<p>Suppose you are wondering whether you could find any paint-on-glass animated movie on social media sites. In that case, there are numerous animated films, like “The Old Man and the Sea,” and “My Love,” produced by the experts of pictures of Aleksandr Petrov animation. Surprisingly, this bind-blowing introduction is a result of oil paints on a sheet of glass.</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Do you aspire to become an animator and come up painting bright colors to videos? Choose animation styles that you most enjoy, find attractive today, and start working on it.

<h4 id="1-2D-Animation-3"><a href="#1-2D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="1.  2D Animation"></a>1.  2D Animation</h4><p>Let’s start with 2D as our fist animation style, which is the traditional or oldest form in practice for more than 100 years since 1908. 2D has widely been in usage to create animated short films, cartoon characters, games, marketing videos, and educational materials. In 2D animation, the characters or items, creatures, and backgrounds get crafted in a two-dimensional space. It produces a graphic of movement with the drawings played serially one after another.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: At present, various free animator tools like Creatoon, Blender, and Pencil 2D, whereas, for professionals, Encore, Flash, Toon Boom Harmony, and Adobe Photoshop can be handy!</p>
<p>The above 2D animation style video is a short film “Dark Dark Woods” directed by the students at “The Animation Workshop.” It is all about the young princess, Maria, drenched, and tired of living a royal life being filled with rules, duties, lessons, responsibilities, and customs. One night, she enters into an adventurous event where she finds herself in a mysterious monster-filled dark wood. Watch the film and find did she find out there!</p>
<h4 id="2-3D-Animation-3"><a href="#2-3D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  3D Animation"></a>2.  3D Animation</h4><p>As the next version of 2D, in the animation industry, 3D revolutionized the market since its first appearance in 1972. Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.</p>
<p>Do you know how it feels if you are trapped alone on a deserted island? “It’s a Cinch!” is a fantastic, funny 3D short film that is an adventurous movie made by the ESMA team at CGI.

<p>What if you wish to animate images, adding movement to stationary objects in time? Well, there are apps for these purposes!</p>
<p>Videos and GIFs are a mainstay of social media. These days it’s rare to see a still photo online. The simplicity with which you can add filter and movement effects to your images has identified a proliferation of these online animated photos.</p>
<p>So what if you wish to apply animation to a still image? There are many apps for such purposes. Given below is a selection of the best apps you can use to animate images on both Android and iPhone devices with the help of animated photo collage apps.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps ](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Wondershare Filmora: The Advanced Editing App of 2022!](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps"><a href="#Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps"></a>Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps</h2><p>We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.</p>
<p>Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.</p>
<h3 id="1-GIPHY"><a href="#1-GIPHY" class="headerlink" title="1. GIPHY"></a>1. GIPHY</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg"
                      alt="giphy"
                ></p>
<p>The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.</p>
<p>Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.</p>
<p>It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.</p>
<h3 id="2-Motionleap"><a href="#2-Motionleap" class="headerlink" title="2. Motionleap"></a>2. Motionleap</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg"
                      alt="motionleap"
                ></p>
<p>Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there’s a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn’t put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.</p>
<p>The app’s primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.</p>
<p>You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.</p>
<p>Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you’ve paid for a Pro account.</p>
<h3 id="3-Movepic"><a href="#3-Movepic" class="headerlink" title="3. Movepic"></a>3. Movepic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg"
                      alt="movepic"
                ></p>
<p>Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that you wouldn’t be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.</p>
<h3 id="4-ImgPlay"><a href="#4-ImgPlay" class="headerlink" title="4. ImgPlay"></a>4. ImgPlay</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg"
                      alt="imgplay"
                ></p>
<p>ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can’t remove unless you update to a complete account.</p>
<p>The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.</p>
<h3 id="5-Zoetropic"><a href="#5-Zoetropic" class="headerlink" title="5. Zoetropic"></a>5. Zoetropic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg"
                      alt="zoetropic"
                ></p>
<p>If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren’t as extensive as other apps we’ve mentioned, it does the job pretty well.</p>
<p>To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.</p>
<p>On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you’re considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.</p>
<h3 id="6-StoryZ"><a href="#6-StoryZ" class="headerlink" title="6. StoryZ"></a>6. StoryZ</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg"
                      alt="storyz"
                ></p>
<p>Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.</p>
<p>One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.</p>
<h3 id="7-Lumyer"><a href="#7-Lumyer" class="headerlink" title="7. Lumyer"></a>7. Lumyer</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg"
                      alt="lumyer"
                ></p>
<p>Lumyer is one of the useful animated photo collage apps on our list, which lets you add hundreds and thousands of effects to your pictures to animate them. So whether you wish to include sparkle or subtle weather effects, seasonal animations for Christmas and Halloween, or all-out scene transformations like appearing on a rollercoaster, Lumyer can do it.</p>
<p>If you’re okay with the watermark, Lumyer is a good choice, but otherwise, you may prefer one of our other recommended photo animation college apps.</p>
<h3 id="8-VIMAGE-3D"><a href="#8-VIMAGE-3D" class="headerlink" title="8. VIMAGE 3D"></a>8. VIMAGE 3D</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-9.jpg"
                      alt="vimage 3d"
                ></p>
<p>VIMAGE got recognized with Google Play award in 2018. It can make some pretty good-looking animated photos in just a few clicks. There’s a wide variety of animations, filters, and sounds to select among a bundle of options.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to select the object because VIMAGE detects and replaces it for you quite automatically.</p>
<p>Similar to these apps, you do need to pay to remove the watermark, get access to the full effects library, and you can export your photos online in up to 2560p resolution.</p>
<h3 id="9-Photo-Bender"><a href="#9-Photo-Bender" class="headerlink" title="9. Photo Bender"></a>9. Photo Bender</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-7.jpg"
                      alt="photo bender"
                ></p>
<p>Photo Bender is an Android-specific animated photo collage app that helps you warp to animate photos digitally by coloring your image by stretching it, bending it, and using brushes. You can then export your transformed images as GIFs, JPEGs, MP4s, and PNGs.</p>
<p>While this app doesn’t contain ratings like others on this list, it is highly rated, so it’s still worth a look.</p>
<h3 id="10-Werble"><a href="#10-Werble" class="headerlink" title="10. Werble"></a>10. Werble</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-10.jpg"
                      alt="werble"
                ></p>
<p>The primary purpose of Werble is to animate your images, and while the basic account is free, in-app purchases are also available. Most of Werble’s animations come through different filter effects that you can add on top of your images.</p>
<p>A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they’re ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Wondershare-Filmora-The-Advanced-Editing-App-of-2022"><a href="#Part-2-Wondershare-Filmora-The-Advanced-Editing-App-of-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Wondershare Filmora: The Advanced Editing App of 2022"></a>Part 2 Wondershare Filmora: The Advanced Editing App of 2022</h2><p>If you are tired of considering various animated photo collage apps, here is a section to introduce you to the best alternative with a reliable yet powerful video editor.</p>

<p>What if you wish to animate images, adding movement to stationary objects in time? Well, there are apps for these purposes!</p>
<p>Videos and GIFs are a mainstay of social media. These days it’s rare to see a still photo online. The simplicity with which you can add filter and movement effects to your images has identified a proliferation of these online animated photos.</p>
<p>So what if you wish to apply animation to a still image? There are many apps for such purposes. Given below is a selection of the best apps you can use to animate images on both Android and iPhone devices with the help of animated photo collage apps.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps-1"><a href="#Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps"></a>Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps</h2><p>We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.</p>
<p>Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.</p>
<h3 id="1-GIPHY-1"><a href="#1-GIPHY-1" class="headerlink" title="1. GIPHY"></a>1. GIPHY</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg"
                      alt="giphy"
                ></p>
<p>The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.</p>
<p>Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.</p>
<p>It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.</p>
<h3 id="2-Motionleap-1"><a href="#2-Motionleap-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Motionleap"></a>2. Motionleap</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg"
                      alt="motionleap"
                ></p>
<p>Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there’s a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn’t put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.</p>
<p>The app’s primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.</p>
<p>You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.</p>
<p>Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you’ve paid for a Pro account.</p>
<h3 id="3-Movepic-1"><a href="#3-Movepic-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Movepic"></a>3. Movepic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg"
                      alt="movepic"
                ></p>
<p>Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that you wouldn’t be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.</p>
<h3 id="4-ImgPlay-1"><a href="#4-ImgPlay-1" class="headerlink" title="4. ImgPlay"></a>4. ImgPlay</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg"
                      alt="imgplay"
                ></p>
<p>ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can’t remove unless you update to a complete account.</p>
<p>The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.</p>
<h3 id="5-Zoetropic-1"><a href="#5-Zoetropic-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Zoetropic"></a>5. Zoetropic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg"
                      alt="zoetropic"
                ></p>
<p>If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren’t as extensive as other apps we’ve mentioned, it does the job pretty well.</p>
<p>To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.</p>
<p>On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you’re considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.</p>
<h3 id="6-StoryZ-1"><a href="#6-StoryZ-1" class="headerlink" title="6. StoryZ"></a>6. StoryZ</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg"
                      alt="storyz"
                ></p>
<p>Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.</p>
<p>One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.</p>
<h3 id="7-Lumyer-1"><a href="#7-Lumyer-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Lumyer"></a>7. Lumyer</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg"
                      alt="lumyer"
                ></p>
<p>Lumyer is one of the useful animated photo collage apps on our list, which lets you add hundreds and thousands of effects to your pictures to animate them. So whether you wish to include sparkle or subtle weather effects, seasonal animations for Christmas and Halloween, or all-out scene transformations like appearing on a rollercoaster, Lumyer can do it.</p>
<p>If you’re okay with the watermark, Lumyer is a good choice, but otherwise, you may prefer one of our other recommended photo animation college apps.</p>
<h3 id="8-VIMAGE-3D-1"><a href="#8-VIMAGE-3D-1" class="headerlink" title="8. VIMAGE 3D"></a>8. VIMAGE 3D</h3><p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-9.jpg"
                      alt="vimage 3d"
                ></p>
<p>VIMAGE got recognized with Google Play award in 2018. It can make some pretty good-looking animated photos in just a few clicks. There’s a wide variety of animations, filters, and sounds to select among a bundle of options.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to select the object because VIMAGE detects and replaces it for you quite automatically.</p>
<p>Similar to these apps, you do need to pay to remove the watermark, get access to the full effects library, and you can export your photos online in up to 2560p resolution.</p>
<h3 id="9-Photo-Bender-1"><a href="#9-Photo-Bender-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Photo Bender"></a>9. Photo Bender</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-7.jpg"
                      alt="photo bender"
                ></p>
<p>Photo Bender is an Android-specific animated photo collage app that helps you warp to animate photos digitally by coloring your image by stretching it, bending it, and using brushes. You can then export your transformed images as GIFs, JPEGs, MP4s, and PNGs.</p>
<p>While this app doesn’t contain ratings like others on this list, it is highly rated, so it’s still worth a look.</p>
<h3 id="10-Werble-1"><a href="#10-Werble-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Werble"></a>10. Werble</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="werble"
                ></p>
<p>The primary purpose of Werble is to animate your images, and while the basic account is free, in-app purchases are also available. Most of Werble’s animations come through different filter effects that you can add on top of your images.</p>
<p>A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they’re ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.</p>

<p>A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they’re ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p>Emojis formerly reigned supreme, but GIFs and memes have since supplanted them. When you add a GIF to a conversation, it becomes more exciting. GIFs are considerably better at communicating our feelings, and they deserve credit for that. Pinterest, like other social networking sites and chat apps, enables GIFs. Pinterest is a photo-sharing website where you can find home decor ideas, recipes, fashion inspiration, DIY projects, and more.</p>
<p>Compared to a static image, adding a GIF to Pinterest conveys more information. You can make GIFs for your DIY projects or use them to display all sides of a cushion, which would typically require many images. But what if you like a GIF you found on Pinterest? What’s the best way to get it? That is what we will demonstrate here. This article will show how to <strong>download Pinterest GIFs</strong> to your computer and mobile device.</p>

Because the pictures on your board aren’t animated, you might conclude that animated GIFs don’t work on Pinterest.

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX"><a href="#05IKMAX" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-8"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-8" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in introducing animations into your content but you don’t have the time or the patience to get too involved with <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro-1"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>

This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-1"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-1" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX-1"><a href="#05IKMAX-1" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-2"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>
