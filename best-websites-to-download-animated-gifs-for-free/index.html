<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>
<h3 id="01Fred-Flintstone"><a href="#01Fred-Flintstone" class="headerlink" title="01Fred Flintstone"></a>01Fred Flintstone</h3><p><img

                      alt="fred flintstone"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>
<h3 id="02Mickey-Mouse"><a href="#02Mickey-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="02Mickey Mouse"></a>02Mickey Mouse</h3><p><img

                      alt="mickey mouse"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>
<h3 id="03SpongeBob-Squarepants"><a href="#03SpongeBob-Squarepants" class="headerlink" title="03SpongeBob Squarepants"></a>03SpongeBob Squarepants</h3><p><img

                      alt="spongebob squarepant"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>
<h3 id="04Tom-and-Jerry"><a href="#04Tom-and-Jerry" class="headerlink" title="04Tom and Jerry"></a>04Tom and Jerry</h3><p><img

                      alt="tom and jerry"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

                      alt="homer simpson"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

                      alt="charlie brown and snoopy"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1950<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Charles M. Schulz<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1940<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices</p>
<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1969<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Joe Ruby and Ken Spears<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others</p>
<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1995<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Tom Ruegger<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche</p>
<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1998<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Craig McCracken<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others</p>
<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p>This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2014<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Will Arnett</p>
<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2005<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dante Basco</p>
<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1950<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Charles M. Schulz<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1940<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices</p>
<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2014<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Will Arnett</p>
<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain.

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-4.jpg"
                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-8.jpg"
                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-9.jpg"
                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-11.jpg"
                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-GIF"><a href="#Part-1-Why-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why GIF?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why GIF?</strong></h2><p>Before we move on to the tutorials, let’s do a brief account on GIF files We’ve also answered some of the more common questions regarding using a <strong>GIF image maker</strong> below for your edification</p>
<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

These occur often with GIF makers that support transparency If you find these happening to you, adjust the transparency settings to get rid of the white pixel outline around your converted GIF.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif8.png"
                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

These occur often with GIF makers that support transparency If you find these happening to you, adjust the transparency settings to get rid of the white pixel outline around your converted GIF.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif14.png"
                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-3"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-3" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif14.png"
                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
