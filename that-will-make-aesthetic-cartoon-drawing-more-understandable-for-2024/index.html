<p>It’s worth noting that people commonly use built-in <strong>OBS animated lower thirds</strong> for the job, but you can also use other editing tools to create custom animations and import them in your OBS Livestream.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about OBS animated lower thirds and their best alternatives you can use in 2022 and beyond.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-8"><a href="#In-this-article-8" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What are Lower Thirds in Animation?](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Like OBS, Wirecast is a popular video streaming platform that many content creators use to live stream on their social media handles. It also offers a layer-based architecture, which means users can add multiple layers separately and manage them through an easy-to-navigate panel.</p>
<p>One of the key reasons Wirecast is an ideal choice to add <strong>animated lower-third</strong> graphics to your live streams is its built-in collections. The tool already has several ready-to-integrate lower-third animations that one could import into their project without any hassle.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition.

It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>

It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives-3"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Draw his arm and waist</p>
<p>Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Draw his legs</p>
<p>Here, we shall portray Captain America in action. Use curved lines to show his extended right leg with boots. The left leg should appear more petite.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other. Sketch too long curved lines to show the mouth and small blonde triangles for the teeth. Above the eyes and nose, draw curved lines.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Draw his arm and waist</p>
<p>Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Draw his legs</p>
<p>Here, we shall portray Captain America in action. Use curved lines to show his extended right leg with boots. The left leg should appear more petite.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Draw his shield</p>
<p>Against his right arm, carefully draw a flattened circular shape. You can achieve this by drawing concentric circles with a large star in the middle. Draw his arm poking out from behind his shield.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other. Sketch too long curved lines to show the mouth and small blonde triangles for the teeth. Above the eyes and nose, draw curved lines.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation"><a href="#023D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation-2"><a href="#023D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>
