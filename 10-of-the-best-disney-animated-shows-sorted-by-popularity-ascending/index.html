<p>Just last year, the old-school animated slapstick comedy, <strong>Animaniacs</strong> was revived and given new life. This <strong>Animaniacs reboot</strong> was a long-time in coming for many fans of the show in the 1990s. In any case, <strong>the Animaniacs (2020)</strong> has inspired many fans of animated movies to start to rewatch their favorites shows in the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>Today, in order to give these fans something to be excited over, we’ve compiled a list of some of the Best Animated TV shows from Disney</p>
<p>Alright, let’s kick things off with our list As mentioned, this will be a comprehensive list of some of the best <strong>Disney Animated Shows</strong> that you can watch right now We’ve ordered them by popularity so that you can have an easier time trying to figure out what to watch</p>

<h2 id="Top-10-Star-vs-the-Forces-of-Evil"><a href="#Top-10-Star-vs-the-Forces-of-Evil" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Star vs. the Forces of Evil"></a>Top 10 <strong>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 2015–2019 [4 Seasons, 22m per episode]</p>
<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Animation, Action, Adventure</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: TV-Y7</p>
<p><strong>Metascore</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p><strong>Director</strong>: Aaron Hammersley, Dominic Bisignano, Brett Varon, Sabrina Cotugno, Piero Piluso, Tyler Chen, Giancarlo Volpe, David Wasson, Michael Mullen , John Davis Infantino, and Amelia Lorenz.</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong>: 7.9</p>
<p><strong>Votes</strong>: 13,266</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, ‘Star vs. the Forces of Evil’ This is an American animated ‘magical-girl’ television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)</p>
<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand — only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully</p>
<h2 id="Top-9-Gargoyles"><a href="#Top-9-Gargoyles" class="headerlink" title="Top 9   Gargoyles"></a>Top 9   <strong>Gargoyles</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1994–1996 [2 Seasons, 30m per episode]</p>
<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Animation, Action, Adventure</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: TV-Y7</p>
<p><strong>Metascore</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>

<p><strong>Stars</strong>: 8.1</p>
<p><strong>Votes</strong>: 15,813</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We go back into the older <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called ‘Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles’ instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action&#x2F;adventure show.</p>
<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.</p>
<h2 id="Top-8-Mickey-Mouse-Clubhouse"><a href="#Top-8-Mickey-Mouse-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="Top 8 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"></a>Top 8 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 2006–2016 [4 Seasons, 30m per episode]</p>

<p><strong>Stars</strong>: 5.8</p>
<p><strong>Votes</strong>: 3,364</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse sees the revival of the classic, Mickey Mouse character (who had been snubbed an extended spot on the big screen outside of the previews and was really only featured in the old film ‘Fantasia) The show was a long-running one. Having aired between 2006 to 2016 with exactly 125 episodes around 30 minutes long.</p>
<p>The demographics for this one mainly comprises of very young children. But, if you like, it’s a safe-for-viewing show that you can have your kids watch and keep distracted And, perhaps, along the way, you can find some joy in these classic characters coming back to life.</p>
<h2 id="Top-7-A-Goofy-Movie"><a href="#Top-7-A-Goofy-Movie" class="headerlink" title="Top 7 A Goofy Movie"></a>Top 7 <strong>A Goofy Movie</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1995 [78 min]</p>

<p><strong>Director</strong>: Kevin Lima</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong>: 6.9</p>
<p><strong>Votes</strong>: 51,043</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Goofy Movie is not actually a TV show, but it is a part of the list of the best <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> on IMDB because it was based on an established television series called ‘Goof Troop’ The movie saw its premiere in 1995 and it starts off a couple of years after the end of the Goof Troop show.</p>
<p>Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show. It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it’s not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it’s sure to provide a good time</p>
<h2 id="Top-6-Monsters-at-Work"><a href="#Top-6-Monsters-at-Work" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Monsters at Work"></a>Top 6 <strong>Monsters at Work</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 2021– [1 Season, 22m per episode]</p>

<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Canva"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Canva?"></a>Part 1 What is Canva?</h2><p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png"
                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"
                      alt="Canva page animations"
                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-5.png"
                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video"><a href="#2-3-Video" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-6.png"
                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Make-Elements-Move-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-3-Make-Elements-Move-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva"></a>Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva</h2><h3 id="How-To-Arrange-The-Order-Of-An-Animation"><a href="#How-To-Arrange-The-Order-Of-An-Animation" class="headerlink" title="How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?"></a>How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?</h3><p>The brilliant thing about Canva is that you can decide the order you want to create your animation. The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.</p>
<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva"></a>How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva</h3><p>Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-About-Making-Animated-Elements-On-Video"><a href="#Part-4-How-About-Making-Animated-Elements-On-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video"></a>Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video</h2><p>If you’ve decided Canva is not the tool for you, you can choose any video editing software to make your animation.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the tool that can help you level up your content creation. It allows users to increase precision and provides professional video editing options.</p>
<p><strong>AI Portrait – The best feature of Wondershare Filmora for gameplay editing</strong></p>

You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-2"><a href="#2-1-Image-2" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-2-Text-2"><a href="#2-2-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="2-3-Video-2"><a href="#2-3-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 04"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 04"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 04"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/stop-motion-puppet-18.jpg"
                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 04"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> If you want to save time, however, it would be better to choose the “Presets” tab. Then, select the preset that you want to use.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Now, drag the selected preset to the timeline. Again, double-tap the preset layer. An editing panel will appear on your screen. Here you can adjust different elements of the preset to customize its playback.</p>

<p>So, that’s everything you need to know about animating image-on-scroll using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="02Use-ScrollSequence"><a href="#02Use-ScrollSequence" class="headerlink" title="02Use ScrollSequence"></a>02Use ScrollSequence</h3><p>Now, if you are not a professional editor or don’t want to overcomplicate things, you can use ScrollSequence to add image-on-scroll animation to your website. For readers who don’t know, ScrollSequence is a built-in WordPress plugin that you can directly install in your WordPress manager. The tool offers hundreds of ready-to-use animation templates that you can integrate and customize without any hassle.</p>
<p>All the templates offer complete customization, which means you can adjust the animation playback, import your own media files, and even customize the text. It’s worth understanding that this method will only work if you are using WordPress as the CMS platform for your website. ScrollSequence is only available as a WordPress plugin and you won’t be able to use it with any other website builder</p>
<h3 id="03Write-Your-Own-JavaScript-Code"><a href="#03Write-Your-Own-JavaScript-Code" class="headerlink" title="03Write Your Own JavaScript Code"></a>03Write Your Own JavaScript Code</h3><p>Finally, you can also write your own JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll. However, this method will be a bit complicated as you would require technical expertise to write dedicated JavaScript scripts to animate image-on-scroll. If you choose this solution, you’ll have to start with writing HTML and CSS codes. This will help you style your web page in the beginning. And, once the web design is up and ready, you can move towards writing the JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll in your web page.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Scrolling-Text-Animation-Infinite-Loop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-a-Scrolling-Text-Animation-Infinite-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create a Scrolling Text Animation (Infinite Loop)"></a>Part 2 How to Create a Scrolling Text Animation (Infinite Loop)</h2><p>Like image-on-scroll, text-on-scroll is another popular way to add visually appealing animations to your web designs. Text-on-scroll animations work the same way as image-on-scroll animations - the only difference is that these types of animations focus on the text playback instead of images. Again, you can use different methods to <strong>animate text on scroll</strong> and make your website’s content run in an infinite loop.</p>
<p>Some of these methods include:</p>
<h3 id="01Use-Filmora-1"><a href="#01Use-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="01Use Filmora"></a>01Use Filmora</h3><p>Thanks to Filmora’s advanced editing panel, you can also use it to animate text within the videos. This will be an ideal solution for users who want to add videos with dedicated text banners and titles on their websites. With Filmora, you’ll be able to animate the text and make custom transitions in a hassle-free manner. Let’s walk you through the detailed procedure of using Wondershare Filmora to add text animation to your videos.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Open Filmora on your system and load the video into its timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Double-tap the video file, and switch to the “Titles” tab. You’ll see a list of different title templates on your screen. Browse through these results and drag the desired template to the timelines. Make sure to adjust the title layer right above the video layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-04.JPG"
                      alt="choose title template filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Again, double-click the title layer and you’ll see a dedicated text editor on your screen. Here enter the text that you want to display within the video. You can also select text size, orientation, and font to personalize its appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Finally, switch to the “Animation” tab at the left sidebar. Choose any of these animation templates and the text within the video will be animated automatically.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-05.JPG"
                      alt="animate title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>So, that’s how you can use Filmora to animate text-on-scroll to improve the overall visual appearance of your website videos.</p>
<h3 id="02Scroll-Text-Animations-for-Single-Words"><a href="#02Scroll-Text-Animations-for-Single-Words" class="headerlink" title="02Scroll-Text-Animations for Single Words"></a>02Scroll-Text-Animations for Single Words</h3><p>Another way to implement scroll-text animations is to modify the HTML &amp; CSS code of your website. Again, this method will only be feasible if you have prior coding experience and know how to write well-optimized code.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-06.JPG"
                      alt="one line animations"
                ></p>
<p>The easiest way to animate text scrolls is through single-line animations.

<p>03 [How to Draw 2d &amp; 3d Characters for Video Games?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-3D-Animation-Game"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-3D-Animation-Game" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D &amp; 3D Animation Game?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D &amp; 3D Animation Game?</h2><p>Gaming animation is a blend of art and technology. It is one of those fields that require several technical skills. These are brilliant programming skills, understanding the basics of computer science, and practical technology know-how, collectively standing as the basic fundamental of Animation. Both 2D and 3D Animation changed the gaming experience forever and created an array of opportunities. But they differ in working and application.</p>
<h3 id="01Working-on-2D-Animation"><a href="#01Working-on-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01Working on 2D Animation"></a>01Working on 2D Animation</h3><p>Flipbook can be a good example of the mechanism behind 2D Animation. After drawing a character or an object on the first page of a notebook, continue drawing for the next page and so on. Each removing should be a bit ahead or behind. When flipped swiftly, the series of drawings makes the character or object move.</p>
<p>The working of 2D Animation is not so different. But the detailing of the subject or the object cannot be minimal as a flipbook. 2D Animation demands more characters and more details while at the same time requiring smooth, visually appealing, and accurate detailing, which is a lot of pressure for the makers. Thanks to 2D making software, a week’s work can be taken care of in minutes or two.</p>
<h3 id="02Working-on-3D-Animation"><a href="#02Working-on-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Working on 3D Animation"></a>02Working on 3D Animation</h3><p>The working mechanism of 3D Animation is more complicated than 2D. It is a layered process that requires several skills. It also involves “rigged” and animated 3D models. In 3D, the initial sketch of the entire subject and object is the first step towards the animation procedure. The second step is to make a 3D model of the intended animated object. It was third, texturing of the 3D animated object. Rigging is the final step; it gives the 3D model the power and ability to move. Once rigging is done, the character is already for posing. Drop it to the scene and start your Animation.</p>

It has persisted as one of the top cultural exports of Japan and has successfully completed more than 20 years of legacy. The name ‘anime’ practically is a shorter version of the word Animation.</p>
<p>You will find that the reasons for <strong>animate games</strong> to be so popular are in vast numbers. For example, the anime industry is valued at 19 billion USD, to begin with.</p>

How To Crop A GIF To A Circle?"></a>1. How To Crop A GIF To A Circle?</h4><p>Whether or not you can crop a GIF into a circle, depends on the cropping tools the app you are using offers. Some GIF makers allow you to choose the shape to which you are going to crop a GIF, while others don’t provide this option.</p>
<p>Using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s mask features <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is probably one of the easiest ways to crop a GIF to a circle, as you simply have to apply the mask to the footage and specify which parts of the GIF’s frames are going to be removed. What’s more, you can choose the shape of the mask in Filmora which enables you to crop GIFs into a variety of different shapes.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-To-Turn-A-Video-Into-A-GIF-3"><a href="#2-How-To-Turn-A-Video-Into-A-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How To Turn A Video Into A GIF?"></a>2. How To Turn A Video Into A GIF?</h4><p>All you need to do in order to turn a video into a GIF is to change the file’s format. Most videos are saved as MP4, AVI, or MOV files, and nearly all video editors and GIF makers allow you to convert a video file into a GIF.</p>
<p>So, you simply have to choose GIF as the format in which you want to export a video file you imported into a video editing software or an online GIF maker and wait for the rendering process to be completed.</p>
