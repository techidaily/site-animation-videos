<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat.

But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible.

It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>

It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-The-Art-of-Effective-Rigging-in-Blender-TUTORIAL-3"><a href="#Part-2-The-Art-of-Effective-Rigging-in-Blender-TUTORIAL-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender [TUTORIAL]"></a>Part 2 <strong>The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender [TUTORIAL]</strong></h2><p>For this next section, we’re going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong>, and so on.</p>
<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3"><a href="#Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course"></a>Part 3 <strong>Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course</strong></h2><p>For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. Whether it be about <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender facial rigging</strong>, <strong>free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs</strong>, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.</p>
<h3 id="01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3"><a href="#01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="01Where to Learn the Course?"></a>01<strong>Where to Learn the Course?</strong></h3><p>The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters’ <strong>blender rigging</strong> course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.</p>

We suggest the “Blender Fundamentals” course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is “Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of <strong>Blender rigging</strong> (including <strong>Blender rigging</strong> and <strong>Blender rigging</strong> videos.)</p>

<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-3"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in trying out <strong>blender rigging</strong> yourself, you’ll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> subjects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master’s introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender’s own “Blender Fundamental” series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you’ll need to know.)</p>

You can then use the picture effects, and other tools present in PowerPoint as mentioned to get your output.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If the target picture has a background, your first step is to isolate it from its background. Remove the background or make it white.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to sharpen the picture by 50%. This is available in the picture corrections effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, copy the image and paste it back as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Repeat these steps four times to make the lines in the image stand out sharply.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, add the color effect of Black and White at 20%.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You will get quite a fairly detailed output.</p>

You can then use the picture effects, and other tools present in PowerPoint as mentioned to get your output.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to sharpen the picture by 50%. This is available in the picture corrections effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, copy the image and paste it back as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Repeat these steps four times to make the lines in the image stand out sharply.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, add the color effect of Black and White at 20%.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You will get quite a fairly detailed output.</p>

Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. <strong>Clay animation</strong> not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.</p>
<p><strong>Clay animation</strong> also uses stop- motion animation. It includes capturing minute movements and of models to make it look like the characters is acting on their own. In stop motion animation, animators typically shoot at fps or fps. Though some claymators prefer to capture it at half the rate, fps or fps whereas fps is frame per second these captured still images are edited then converted into a video or film using stop motion software.</p>
<p>In recent times use of editing software and developed cameras has made the shooting process easier. Also, armatures clay models have eased the process of creating sculptures. Though, time is still a great deal while making clay animation.</p>

Wallace is the star of the franchise featuring Wallace and Gromit. The idea of this dynamic duo took about seven years to turn into a full scale television show. It went to becoming an Oscar winning work of art.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Victor Van Dort (Corpse Bride):</strong> The persona of a handsome man in his prime. Short and messy brown vest over a slim structure with big brown eyes. The protagonist of the corpse bride, Victor is a character in conflict stuck within an epic love triangle involving the dead. This amazing dark satire brings out the best in clay animation with precise movements and amazing music.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rocky (Chicken Run):</strong> Mel Gibson went out on a foot with Rocky, though he is known for the same. Rocky is the second character with prominence in the film. The plot is about chickens attempting to escape their inevitable demise. Rocky crash lands in the coop pretending to have figured out how to fly.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Coraline:</strong> Not your everyday story about an eleven year old. Coraline Jones continues to haunt&#x2F;impact us all even today and has a strong cult backing. It was initially meant to be live action but was later shifted to Claymation which took over four years to make.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Shaun the Sheep:</strong> Shaun is a sheep (obviously) who goes on world adventures. The movies was featured as the TV spin off. The character was meant to appeal to both children and family. The entire movie was dependant on movement and expressions rather than dialogue making Claymation the perfect medium to bring out the character.</p>

<p>Directed by Time Burton, this film is one that impresses us all every time. The success of this Claymation is embedded in the fact that it made creepy gothic characters look appealing. It has a mixture of both the Halloween and Christmas theme. The character Jack Skellington goes through a magic door to arrive at ‘Christmas Town’. Using Claymation was an excellent choice for the script as it enabled the animators to bring about that distorted movements that evolved into a gorgeous visual storytelling.</p>

<p>Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.</p>

<p>The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.</p>

<p>Here’s where Tim Burton establishes his cult following. The film Caroline was based the novel by Neil Gaiman. The story is about the weird adventures of a girl named ‘Caroline’ and a button eyed rag doll who she meets after travelling through a portal. Laika Studios made the appeal of the film as beautiful yet unsettling. It harbors plenty of dark and creepy aspects like by many followers of this type of fiction.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are dozen animated films that were way ahead of their time and were discontinued as the medium was seen more to be specifically directed for children only. Tim Burton’s creation ‘Frankenweenie’ was considered a ‘love letter’ to the Golden Age of Horror films. It was considered too dark for the average viewer so the director was later let go by Disney.</p>

<p>A more somber attempt at stop motion films was Paranorman. It featured printed faces in the characters which needed a new and innovative creative approach. People experienced ground breaking characterization of an openly gay character in the film which was a milestone in terms of mainstream animated films. Films like ‘Paranorman’ perfectly depicts the entry of modern film making software like ****<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>** and Maya in stop motion animations.</p>

<p>Directed by Time Burton, this film is one that impresses us all every time. The success of this Claymation is embedded in the fact that it made creepy gothic characters look appealing. It has a mixture of both the Halloween and Christmas theme. The character Jack Skellington goes through a magic door to arrive at ‘Christmas Town’. Using Claymation was an excellent choice for the script as it enabled the animators to bring about that distorted movements that evolved into a gorgeous visual storytelling.</p>

<p>Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.</p>
<h3 id="05Coraline-2009-1"><a href="#05Coraline-2009-1" class="headerlink" title="05Coraline (2009)"></a>05Coraline (2009)</h3><p><img

<p>Here’s where Tim Burton establishes his cult following. The film Caroline was based the novel by Neil Gaiman. The story is about the weird adventures of a girl named ‘Caroline’ and a button eyed rag doll who she meets after travelling through a portal. Laika Studios made the appeal of the film as beautiful yet unsettling. It harbors plenty of dark and creepy aspects like by many followers of this type of fiction.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are dozen animated films that were way ahead of their time and were discontinued as the medium was seen more to be specifically directed for children only. Tim Burton’s creation ‘Frankenweenie’ was considered a ‘love letter’ to the Golden Age of Horror films. It was considered too dark for the average viewer so the director was later let go by Disney.</p>

<p>A more somber attempt at stop motion films was Paranorman. It featured printed faces in the characters which needed a new and innovative creative approach. People experienced ground breaking characterization of an openly gay character in the film which was a milestone in terms of mainstream animated films. Films like ‘Paranorman’ perfectly depicts the entry of modern film making software like ****<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>** and Maya in stop motion animations.</p>

Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. <strong>Clay animation</strong> not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look.

The entire tribe is facing difficulties because of their simple existence and also because there are other people who are threatening them. They are not ready to go down without a fight, and then somehow it happens. This storey is interesting to see because it is a family film and the kids can enjoy it easily, as can adults too.</p>

There is a strange behaviour portrayed by them, which gets fans hooked on it. Some people consider it a suspenseful movie because, initially, they are not able to conclude what is happening. But in the end, somewhere, the young man has courage and compassion, which helps him to master his paranormal abilities. Also, it is quite interesting to watch how he is able to develop his skills throughout.</p>
<h3 id="15The-Missing-Link-2019-3"><a href="#15The-Missing-Link-2019-3" class="headerlink" title="15The Missing Link (2019)"></a>15The Missing Link (2019)</h3><p>“Missing Link” is a movie based on the life of a person who is tired of living a solitary life in the Pacific Northwest. He is 8 feet tall and covered with fur. He is so experienced, but somehow his destiny is not favouring him. However, it is the hypothetical Instinct creature and is considered to be the evolutionary line between modern human beings and anthropoid progenitors. It is right to conclude that this plot revolves around a lot of human existence and early man, helping people to understand things in a bit more detail.</p>
