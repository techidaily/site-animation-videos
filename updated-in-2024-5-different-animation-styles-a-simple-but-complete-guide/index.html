We are all set to take you through a ride of different animation styles, their importance, and some of the videos that one should give a try!</p>
<h4 id="1-2D-Animation"><a href="#1-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="1.  2D Animation"></a>1.  2D Animation</h4><p>Let’s start with 2D as our fist animation style, which is the traditional or oldest form in practice for more than 100 years since 1908. 2D has widely been in usage to create animated short films, cartoon characters, games, marketing videos, and educational materials. In 2D animation, the characters or items, creatures, and backgrounds get crafted in a two-dimensional space. It produces a graphic of movement with the drawings played serially one after another.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: At present, various free animator tools like Creatoon, Blender, and Pencil 2D, whereas, for professionals, Encore, Flash, Toon Boom Harmony, and Adobe Photoshop can be handy!</p>
<p>The above 2D animation style video is a short film “Dark Dark Woods” directed by the students at “The Animation Workshop.” It is all about the young princess, Maria, drenched, and tired of living a royal life being filled with rules, duties, lessons, responsibilities, and customs. One night, she enters into an adventurous event where she finds herself in a mysterious monster-filled dark wood. Watch the film and find did she find out there!</p>
<h4 id="2-3D-Animation"><a href="#2-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="2.  3D Animation"></a>2.  3D Animation</h4><p>As the next version of 2D, in the animation industry, 3D revolutionized the market since its first appearance in 1972. Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.</p>

For sure, you will like this funny movie all about atrocities happening with a man and a pelican and enjoy it as much as I did!</p>
<h4 id="3-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#3-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="3.  Motion Graphics"></a>3.  Motion Graphics</h4><p>Our next animation style is motion graphics of the animated graphic design, where text appears to be the main enhancing factor. It is a piece of animation or digital footage that illuminates a motion or notation incorporated with audio. It is a new way of communicating to the audience and in driving them deep into the story. You can categorize it under the visual effect technique, which involves the movement of graphic images or elements like logos or text, sound, music, and motion. Motion graphics are best to be found in action and finds a place in multimedia projects, advertising agencies, branding, television title making, and storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: Tools that are best for motion graphics is Mocha AE, After Effects, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D.</p>
<p>The world is a great place, but we always forget another beautiful hidden green world behind the fantastic buildings we reside in. Yes, “Beautiful World” is a motion graphic video by Blasterjaxx &amp; DBSTF feat. Ryder presents how we humans have developed a great empire by destroying the other beautiful part of the world.</p>
<h4 id="4-Stop-Motion"><a href="#4-Stop-Motion" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stop Motion"></a>4.  Stop Motion</h4><p>Stop motion is one of the traditional animation styles that is the most popular filmmaking technique that uses hand-crafted or manipulated objects, mostly clay models. Puppets, silhouettes, and cut-outs can also be implemented as stop motion aids to produce animation. It is labor-intensive, a form of art, and has its flavor in animation, although 3D and visual effects have replaced it quite a long time before. But still, filmmakers like Tim Burton use stop motion in their films, making it to withstand the animation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: You can make your stop motion video with software like Dragon frame, Stop Motion Pro Eclipse, and IKITMovie.</p>
<p>Although stop motion has gone before ages, there is still a fantastic introduction. Here is an award-winning short film, “Tokri (the basket),” which is a clumsy accident that leads a juvenile girl onto Mumbai’s streets with the trust of making things correct. Studio Eeksaurus, an Indian bastion animation company, has depicted a father and daughter’s tender emotive tale.</p>
<h4 id="5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation"><a href="#5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation" class="headerlink" title="5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation"></a>5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation</h4><p>Here is a Paint-on-Glass animation style that is a technique used for making animated films that gives a lot of fun. Artists paint short stories on glasses using oil paints and film them by recording it frame-by-frame. Russian animator Aleksandr Petrov is a famous artist well known for making award-winning paint-on-glass animation. Animators use different objects like brick dust, sand, pastels, and charcoal, to create outstanding drama in their films.</p>

<h4 id="2-3D-Animation-1"><a href="#2-3D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="2.  3D Animation"></a>2.  3D Animation</h4><p>As the next version of 2D, in the animation industry, 3D revolutionized the market since its first appearance in 1972. Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.</p>

<h4 id="3-Motion-Graphics-1"><a href="#3-Motion-Graphics-1" class="headerlink" title="3.  Motion Graphics"></a>3.  Motion Graphics</h4><p>Our next animation style is motion graphics of the animated graphic design, where text appears to be the main enhancing factor. It is a piece of animation or digital footage that illuminates a motion or notation incorporated with audio. It is a new way of communicating to the audience and in driving them deep into the story. You can categorize it under the visual effect technique, which involves the movement of graphic images or elements like logos or text, sound, music, and motion. Motion graphics are best to be found in action and finds a place in multimedia projects, advertising agencies, branding, television title making, and storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: Tools that are best for motion graphics is Mocha AE, After Effects, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D.</p>

<h4 id="4-Stop-Motion-1"><a href="#4-Stop-Motion-1" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stop Motion"></a>4.  Stop Motion</h4><p>Stop motion is one of the traditional animation styles that is the most popular filmmaking technique that uses hand-crafted or manipulated objects, mostly clay models. Puppets, silhouettes, and cut-outs can also be implemented as stop motion aids to produce animation. It is labor-intensive, a form of art, and has its flavor in animation, although 3D and visual effects have replaced it quite a long time before. But still, filmmakers like Tim Burton use stop motion in their films, making it to withstand the animation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: You can make your stop motion video with software like Dragon frame, Stop Motion Pro Eclipse, and IKITMovie.</p>
<p>Although stop motion has gone before ages, there is still a fantastic introduction. Here is an award-winning short film, “Tokri (the basket),” which is a clumsy accident that leads a juvenile girl onto Mumbai’s streets with the trust of making things correct. Studio Eeksaurus, an Indian bastion animation company, has depicted a father and daughter’s tender emotive tale.</p>
<h4 id="5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation-1"><a href="#5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation"></a>5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation</h4><p>Here is a Paint-on-Glass animation style that is a technique used for making animated films that gives a lot of fun. Artists paint short stories on glasses using oil paints and film them by recording it frame-by-frame. Russian animator Aleksandr Petrov is a famous artist well known for making award-winning paint-on-glass animation. Animators use different objects like brick dust, sand, pastels, and charcoal, to create outstanding drama in their films.</p>

<p>From among the several trends that emerged on Social Media, making a 3D cartoon of yourself is probably the most popular.</p>
<p>Learning how to make 3D cartoons may just be in the height of demand in the near future.</p>

Plus how to cartoon yourself with it"></a>Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it</h2><p>We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="voila ai artist"
                ></p>
<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>

Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.</p>
<p>There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D).

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

Plus how to cartoon yourself with it"></a>Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it</h2><p>We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>

Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.</p>
<p>There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.</p>

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>
