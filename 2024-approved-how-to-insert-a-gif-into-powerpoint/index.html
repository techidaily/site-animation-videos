<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now. People who use this application make a common mistake of using too many slides with huge amounts of text and that is a major turnoff for the audience. Huge text is seen as a disaster. You should be able to convey an interesting story to your attentive audience without explaining every single detail on your slides for your presentation. Using a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GIF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to explain complicate things or just set it as a background can be much interesting.</p>

<h4 id="Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility"><a href="#Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility"></a>Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility</h4><p> Select the Insert tab located at the top of the Powerpoint application.</p>

                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>
<p> You also have the option to move the GIF image on the page by clicking and dragging the image to the location that you want to place the picture.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Copy-and-Paste"><a href="#Method-2-Copy-and-Paste" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Copy and Paste"></a>Method 2: Copy and Paste</h4><p> A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first. Then, paste your image on the Powerpoint slide by pressing Control + V.</p>
<p> You can also highlight the file name, and then use the drag and drop feature to put your image directly into the Powerpoint slide of your choice.</p>
<h4 id="Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web"><a href="#Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web"></a>Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web</h4><p> The final method is to embed GIF images on the Internet into a Powerpoint slide. You can achieve this function by using the Insert Ribbon’s Pictures icon.</p>
<p> Select Pictures, then write in the image URL directly in the File input box. Then, select Insert. The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.</p>
<p> Here we recommend the method 1 and 2, the method 3 will take a little time while Powerpoint downloading the GIF picture.</p>

It will open up a brand new Format Picture window that will have a good variety of image editing menus at your fingertips at the left side of the computer window.</p>

<p>There has been an advancement in the cartoon since the last publication made by “Paste” (a 5,800-word short story by Henry James). However, traditional cable networks have created exciting and new worlds and characters. Various streaming platforms like YouTube have allowed different creators to <strong>draw cartoon videos</strong> and publish them as they want. It has long been said that cartoons are specifically made for kids to enjoy on Saturday morning, but this is no longer the case as adults now enjoy watching cartoons in their free time.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

<h3 id="01Futurama-1"><a href="#01Futurama-1" class="headerlink" title="01Futurama"></a>01Futurama</h3><p>This <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that’s pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.</p>

This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor’s non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz’s Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.</p>

However, four (4) days later, the series was renewed for a second season, released on July 17, 2015.

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.</p>
<p>Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).</p>
<p>The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.</p>
<p>Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.</p>
<p>Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.</p>
<p>This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.</p>

<p>When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.</p>
<p>The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>In <strong>Cinema, character rigging</strong> has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.</p>
<p>Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.</p>
<p>The process;</p>
<p><strong>Weight Painting:</strong> An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.</p>
<p><strong>Placing Bones:</strong> After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics:</strong> Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon’s tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Constraints:</strong> The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can’t do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation Skeletons:</strong> Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.</p>
<p><strong>Create an animated movie:</strong> You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with <strong>Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.</strong> Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigs:</strong> Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.</p>

Are There Any Plugins or Easy"></a>Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy</h2><p><strong>How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy</strong></p>
<p>When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.</p>
<p>The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>In <strong>Cinema, character rigging</strong> has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.</p>
<p>Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.</p>
<p>The process;</p>
<p><strong>Weight Painting:</strong> An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.</p>
<p><strong>Placing Bones:</strong> After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics:</strong> Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon’s tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Constraints:</strong> The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can’t do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation Skeletons:</strong> Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.</p>
<p><strong>Create an animated movie:</strong> You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with <strong>Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.</strong> Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigs:</strong> Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.</p>

<p>The function of <strong>character rigging</strong> can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.</p>

It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.</p>
<p>Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).</p>
<p>The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.</p>
<p>Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.</p>
<p>Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.</p>
<p>This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.</p>
<p>Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.</p>

The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.</p>
<p>You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don’t. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.</p>

Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.</p>

<p>When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.</p>
<p>The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>In <strong>Cinema, character rigging</strong> has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.</p>
<p>Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.</p>
<p>The process;</p>
<p><strong>Weight Painting:</strong> An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.</p>
<p><strong>Placing Bones:</strong> After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics:</strong> Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon’s tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Constraints:</strong> The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can’t do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation Skeletons:</strong> Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.</p>
<p><strong>Create an animated movie:</strong> You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with <strong>Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.</strong> Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigs:</strong> Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.</p>

<p>The function of <strong>character rigging</strong> can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.</p>

It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.</p>
<p>Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).</p>
<p>The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.</p>
<p>Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.</p>
<p>Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.</p>
<p>This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.</p>
<p>Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.</p>

The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.</p>
<p>You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don’t. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.</p>

Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.</p>
