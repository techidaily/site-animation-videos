(Check out GIPHY Labs to explore their expansion efforts.)</p>
<p>The best part? Looking for the database of GIFs couldn’t be easier: Users can browse categories — Music, Adjectives, Nature, Science, Nature, etc. — or seek out a specific phrase or a word using the search feature.</p>

<p>You can save the GIF to your PC and copy its URL to find it online once created. It further consists of options for making your GIF public, private, or unlisted. You can even link directly to the GIF file.</p>

Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>

On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>
