<p>It’s worth noting that people commonly use built-in <strong>OBS animated lower thirds</strong> for the job, but you can also use other editing tools to create custom animations and import them in your OBS Livestream.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about OBS animated lower thirds and their best alternatives you can use in 2022 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>

<p>Like OBS, Wirecast is a popular video streaming platform that many content creators use to live stream on their social media handles. It also offers a layer-based architecture, which means users can add multiple layers separately and manage them through an easy-to-navigate panel.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Built-in lower-third graphic templates</p>

You can either import dedicated PSD files, embed HTML codes, or choose one of the ready-to-use lower-third templates to do the job. In either case, vMix will help you add stunning lower-third animations within a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Full-scale video production software</p>

<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend vMix?</strong></p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives-1"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>

So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>

For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>

<p>Before you act surprised, let us clarify that Adobe Photoshop isn’t an alternative to OBS Studio.

<p><strong>●</strong> Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics</p>

<p>And, once you have successfully designed the lower-third overlays, you can use any of the live stream managers to add them to your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Design custom overlays for your social media live streams</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photoshop has a steep learning curve, and if you are not an experienced designer, you won’t be able to design custom overlays</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Adobe Photoshop?</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop is a reliable choice for creators who find the built-in media libraries of a live stream manager limited. With Photoshop, you’ll be able to design custom overlays for your live streams.</p>
<h3 id="06ShareX-3"><a href="#06ShareX-3" class="headerlink" title="06ShareX"></a>06ShareX</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/obs-animated-lower-thirds-alternative-07.jpg"
                      alt="ShareX"
                ></p>
<p>ShareX is also an open-source screen recorder and lives stream manager that offers all the OBS features you’ll need to manage your live streams and add multiple lower-third overlays. The only downside of ShareX is that it has a complicated user interface. Even if you have used OBS in the past, you’ll find ShareX’s user interface relatively complex. So, you should only sign up for ShareX if you are comfortable with complex user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Upload and save pictures, videos, logos for lower-third overlays</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Record your entire screen or a specific window</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Assign hotkeys to switch between multiple windows during the Livestream</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The user interface isn’t as friendly as other available options</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend ShareX?</strong></p>
<p>ShareX is an ideal <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> alternative for users who need a free-of-cost solution to manage their live streams.</p>
<h3 id="07Canva-3"><a href="#07Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="07Canva"></a>07Canva</h3><p><img

                      alt="Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Again, Canva doesn’t support live stream management at all. However, like Adobe Photoshop, you can use Canva to create stunning lower-third overlays for your Livestream sessions. The major benefit of using Canva is that it has thousands of pre-made templates that you can import to your design with one click. All these templates are fully customizable - so you’ll be able to design custom lower-third overlays for your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Comparatively less complicated than Adobe Photoshop</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Canva is affordable</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Being a web-based designing tool, you can access Canva on any device</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The premium version of Canva is relatively expensive than its competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Canva?</strong></p>
<p>Canva is a one-stop solution for content creators looking for an additional designing tool to create custom OBS animated lower thirds for their live streams.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> OBS animated lower-thirds are one of the most effective ways to share the context of a live stream with your viewers</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With OBS Studio, you have the liberty to import custom animated lower-third animations and overlays and add them to the live stream through its layered architecture</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apart from OBS Studio, there are several other tools (such as Wondershare Filmora Pro) to add animated lower-thirds to live streams.</p>

<p>Childhood crushes and idolization of <strong>animated characters</strong> were very normal things! <strong>Popular animated characters</strong> were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!</p>
<p>Today, in order to reminisce a little, we’ll be going through some of the more <strong>famous animated characters</strong>!</p>
<p>Although we initially promised only 15 <strong>animated characters</strong>, we’ve stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more <strong>popular animated characters</strong> to reminisce about! We’ve also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!</p>
<h3 id="01Mickey-Mouse"><a href="#01Mickey-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="01Mickey Mouse"></a>01Mickey Mouse</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Steamboat Willie (1928)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine</p>
<p>When it comes to admirable <strong>animated characters</strong>, Disney’s Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune! He merited the top spot simply for that fame, even though, in all honesty, his time on the big screen had been pretty limited (with his biggest performance having been from Fantasia).</p>

<h3 id="02Woody"><a href="#02Woody" class="headerlink" title="02Woody"></a>02Woody</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tom Hanks</p>
<p>We of course also cannot forget Toy Story’s Woody in a discussion of <strong>famous animated characters</strong>. This cowboy toy comes equipped with a pull-string that just oozes personality (both good and bad), leading up to a very satisfying movie-watching experience as we watch him grow from the selfish toy that he had been in the beginning to the generous, and forgiving toy that he developed into by the fourth movie in the series!</p>

<h3 id="03Buzz-Lightyear"><a href="#03Buzz-Lightyear" class="headerlink" title="03Buzz Lightyear"></a>03Buzz Lightyear</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tim Allen</p>
<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Finding Nemo (2003)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>Dory was undoubtedly the underdog of the Finding Nemo franchise! This lovable fish, <strong>Voiced by</strong> the equally loveable Ellen DeGeneres, stole the show and earned herself her own feature film that all the animated movie lovers came to watch in 2016! Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.</p>

<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Hitoshi Takagi</p>
<p>Speaking of cute characters, how can one forget about Totoro!

<h3 id="07Wall-E"><a href="#07Wall-E" class="headerlink" title="07Wall-E"></a>07Wall-E</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Wall-E (2008)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Cameo in Cars (2006)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ben Burtt</p>
<p>Wall-E broke the box office for its underlying message regarding how we humans treat our world, but also because of its loveable characters! Who can say that they did not fall in love with Wall-E and his darling Eve? Despite his almost-mute character, he was brought to life in a way that made him very easy to love and would be remembered for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Shrek</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Eddie Murphy</p>
<p>Shrek’s Donkey is another one of those characters that you just cannot forget! <strong>Voiced by</strong> the hilarious Eddie Murphy, he added that constant spark of humor that kept the movie’s tone light and exciting, fully encompassing the kind of tone that the film was going for.</p>

<h3 id="09Cruella-de-Vil"><a href="#09Cruella-de-Vil" class="headerlink" title="09Cruella de Vil"></a>09Cruella de Vil</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: 101 Dalmatians</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: 101 Dalmatians</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Betty Lou Gerson</p>
<p>When it comes to classic villain <strong>animated characters</strong>, one cannot forget about the illustrious Cruella de Vil! This character was pure evil in a feminine form! Designed to be the enemy of puppy lovers everywhere all while bringing a little spice into what would have otherwise been a sweet, slice of life film.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="10Boo"><a href="#10Boo" class="headerlink" title="10Boo"></a>10Boo</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Monsters Inc.</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Monsters Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Mary Gibbs</p>
<p>Boo from Monsters Inc is one of the most <strong>popular animated characters</strong> on the big screen! She was loveable, sweet, and perfectly voice acted — bringing on some much-needed cute into the heart-warming story.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Monsters Inc</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Billy Crystal</p>
<p>Still on the Monster Inc train, we have Mike Wasowski! His refreshing character brought some levity into the story, bringing on some much-needed laughs and just, in general, providing a solid counterpart to Sulley!</p>

<h3 id="12Toothless"><a href="#12Toothless" class="headerlink" title="12Toothless"></a>12Toothless</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon, How to Train your Dragon 2</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="13Chihiro"><a href="#13Chihiro" class="headerlink" title="13Chihiro"></a>13Chihiro</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase</p>
<p>The story of Chihiro from ‘Spirited Away’ is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget! This character, if you weren’t aware, was also created by Miyazaki (the same creator of ‘Totoro!’) She’s a part of a long line of greatly designed and developed characters whose journey you just can’t look away from.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="14Lumiere"><a href="#14Lumiere" class="headerlink" title="14Lumiere"></a>14Lumiere</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991), The Enchanted Christmas (1997)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jerry Orbach</p>
<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved <strong>Disney Animated Characters</strong>, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (<strong>Voiced by</strong> Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the ‘Be Our Guest’ track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast’s love story.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="15Sophie"><a href="#15Sophie" class="headerlink" title="15Sophie"></a>15Sophie</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Chieko Baisho; Emily Mortimer &amp; Jean Simmons</p>
<p>To wrap up our main list, we have another Miyazaki character in the form of Sophie — from Howl’s Moving Castle! Howl’s Moving Castle is another beautiful classic that you just can’t help but love, and a lot of that is all thanks to its complex and believable heroine, Sophie!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #1: Baloo</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: The Jungle Book (1967), The Jungle Book 2 (2003)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: The Jungle Book (1967)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Phil Harris; John Goodman</p>
<p>For the first of our honorable mentions, we have Baloo from ‘The Jungle Book’! Baloo is soft and cuddly — perfectly loveable while providing sage advice for the main character! His performance in the film was certainly an unforgettable one (worth the repeat viewing!)</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #2: Maleficent</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Sleeping Beauty (1959)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Sleeping Beauty (1959)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Eleanor Audley</p>
<p>Maleficent from ‘Sleeping Beauty’ also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent’s LIVE action form merited a sequel.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Dumbo (1941)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Dumbo (1941)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>Dumbo joins the cast of cute and cuddly characters that manage to make an impact with little to no words! His amazing animation managed to convey his entire story despite his muteness, speaking to the great talent of his animators!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #4: Coraline</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Coraline (2008)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Coraline (2008)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Dakota Fanning</p>
<p>Coraline’s animation is certainly unique, but that’s one of the reasons why she and her film stand out so much! In terms of <strong>animated characters</strong>, Coraline stands out with her unique design and equally unique story. She’s certainly not a heroine that you should mess with!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #5: Jack Skellington</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Chris Sarandon, Henry Sellick (singing)</p>
<p>Although Jack Skellington’s film, ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’ may not be as well known as others, those that do know of it speak well of his character! His complex personality gives way for a very interesting tale, one that has captivated many an audience and merited repeat viewings (perfect for the holiday season!)</p>

<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep!

<p>Today, in order to reminisce a little, we’ll be going through some of the more <strong>famous animated characters</strong>!</p>
<p>Although we initially promised only 15 <strong>animated characters</strong>, we’ve stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more <strong>popular animated characters</strong> to reminisce about! We’ve also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!</p>

<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tim Allen</p>
<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep!

<p>The story of Chihiro from ‘Spirited Away’ is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget!

<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved <strong>Disney Animated Characters</strong>, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (<strong>Voiced by</strong> Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the ‘Be Our Guest’ track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast’s love story.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG"
                      alt="delete animation folder unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject"></a>02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject</h3><p>Now, you may have different subjects. We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG"
                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator"><a href="#01Add-the-animator" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG"
                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation"><a href="#03Create-an-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG"
                      alt="delete keyframe unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum"><a href="#04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum" class="headerlink" title="04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum"></a>04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum</h3><p>With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG"
                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG"
                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject"></a>02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject</h3><p>Now, you may have different subjects. We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG"
                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-1"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-1" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-1"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-1" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG"
                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-1"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="delete keyframe unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-1"><a href="#04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-1" class="headerlink" title="04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum"></a>04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum</h3><p>With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG"
                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation-1"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG"
                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG"
                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-2"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-2" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-2"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-2" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG"
                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-2"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG"
                      alt="delete keyframe unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-2"><a href="#04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-2" class="headerlink" title="04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum"></a>04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum</h3><p>With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG"
                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation-2"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG"
                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="unity animation"
                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-7"><a href="#In-this-article-7" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-3"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-3" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-3"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-3" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-3"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation-3"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: “learning.” Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician’s assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.</p>
<p>Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of <strong>cartoon character drawing</strong> and practice some <strong>easy, simple cartoon drawing</strong> before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw cartoons characters"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Cartoon-Easy-Sketch-Drawing-Step-by-Step"><a href="#Part-2-Cartoon-Easy-Sketch-Drawing-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step"></a>Part 2 <strong>Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step</strong></h2><p>This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you’re going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.</p>
<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to sketch drawing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>

Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you’re going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.</p>
<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>

                      alt="how to sketch drawing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: “learning.” Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician’s assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.</p>
<p>Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of <strong>cartoon character drawing</strong> and practice some <strong>easy, simple cartoon drawing</strong> before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw cartoons characters"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-3"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>
