Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

So, the next part would be to turn these raw images into an animation. To do this, you can use different types of video editing applications. However, we recommend using Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.</p>

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

The procedures are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can take references from real-life objects.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the Animation we see here has been taken from real-life references, be it a cat, car, house, etc. So, to develop the <strong>cartoon styles,</strong> you can take references from real-life objects. You can also search for a particular characteristic in things you won’t use as your reference. If you want to draw a cat, you can use a living cat as your reference.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can copy and try to make Animation like your favorite animator.</strong></p>
<p>If you use this method, this will help you improve your skill. No animation is 100% real, no matter what kind of Animation it is or who is creating it. However, you cannot keep on making animations like your favorite animator because you will not be able to find your <strong>anime art styles</strong> and skills.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can create an animated character of your own.</strong></p>
<p>After taking your reference from real-life objects and knowing about the animation styles and the basic principles of Animation, you can create your animated character. If you create your character, keeping all the skills and techniques in mind, you can develop outstanding animation styles.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>To develop your cartoon style, you need to practice drawing regularly.</strong></p>
<p>To get s grasp this whole process of Animation, you need to draw and practice <strong>different cartoon art styles.</strong> You can draw anything you like, or you don’t like on paper or on a drawing tablet. You can also color sketchbooks to improve your skills in Animation.</p>
<p>You can use Filmora to make cartoon videos and, at the same time, make cartoon videos of normally captured videos. These cartoon videos can be compiled into one video. You can use this video to edit different types of videos. Filmora has a user-friendly interface that can help you create your cartoon video effortlessly.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> These methods can help you make the best for your next marketing project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> These methods are easy, efficient, and efficient. All the aforementioned methods were discovered in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.</p>
