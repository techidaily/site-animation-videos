These days you can do whatever you want online so animating still pictures should be a piece of cake if you know-how.</p>
<p>A video is basically an entire collage of moving pictures. So if you can cut out pictures from a video why not turn still pictures into animations.</p>
<p><strong>There are a number of ways you can use to animate still images →</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Videos are multiple pictures that move at a frame rate. Make short copies of a video by cutting out the essential moments and playing them in a loop.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add and play video animation elements over a picture. With the right software, this task is as easy as copy-pasting over another image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply an animated 3D image with a transparent background over another image. Remember, the bigger the element the closer it is. So size is directly translated as distance.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can use multiple filters and effects on an image with an <strong>animated portrait app</strong>. Find out what app you can use further on in this article.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Turn an image into a GIF. No matter its small size and cartoonish style, GIF animation has a very wide appeal as online content.</p>

<p>A video is basically an entire collage of moving pictures. So if you can cut out pictures from a video why not turn still pictures into animations.</p>
<p><strong>There are a number of ways you can use to animate still images →</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Videos are multiple pictures that move at a frame rate. Make short copies of a video by cutting out the essential moments and playing them in a loop.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Apply an animated 3D image with a transparent background over another image. Remember, the bigger the element the closer it is. So size is directly translated as distance.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can use multiple filters and effects on an image with an <strong>animated portrait app</strong>. Find out what app you can use further on in this article.</p>

If you are a big fan of fantasy games, your imaginations should not have any boundaries. But, in the case of a sports game, you might have to limit your imagination based on realistic features.</p>
<p><strong>How to streamline wild ideas to get a brilliant character out of it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Get an idea</strong></p>
<p>Decide whether the character in mind is the main character or what role, in particular, is it going to play in the game.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Gender</strong></p>
<p>Gender plays a crucial role in character creation. As it pre-decides certain character traits.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Build personality</strong></p>
<p>Every character has a specific goal. The personality of each character helps them to achieve their goal.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Back-story</strong></p>
<p>The personality traits of every character are derived from their back-story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Strength&amp; Weakness</strong></p>
<p>Each character should have something unique be it in their personality or in their strength.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Define Relationship</strong></p>
<p>It is important to imagine and define what relationship the characters have.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Provide aesthetics</strong></p>
<p>Visual Aesthetics is a realm that has no bounds in the art of gaming.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create more characters</strong></p>
<p>Including other characters in relation to the protagonist of the game would make the game or the storyline more interesting.</p>

But, creating a character from an initial sketch all the way to making it into a full-drawn animation is about developing details keeping the speed of work steady.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed animate game tutorials available online:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create composition</strong></p>
<p>Make it more defined and structured. A tip to immediately jump-start your imagination would be to see your character in different lights and shades.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Refine the Character Sketch</strong></p>
<p>Once you have the clay, it’s time to add form.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add References</strong></p>
<p>Start looking for references that suit your character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add Details</strong></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to get into the details, like literally. Start breaking your character into blocks and pieces. Maybe not too literally.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Animated games have a global appeal because of their unique style, history, customization, and action features. Animating your own character requires you to pay attention to the details like personality, back story, gender, and aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can start your animation process with 5 simple steps - concept, composition, sketch, reference, and detailing.</p>
