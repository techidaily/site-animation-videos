Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover-2"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character-2"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Is-Adobe-Character-Animator-Easy-to-Use-2"><a href="#Part-2-Is-Adobe-Character-Animator-Easy-to-Use-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?"></a>Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?</h2><p>That’s how you can animate a character in Adobe character animator and create visually stunning animations. However, many beginners want to know if it’s easy to use Adobe character animator. The answer is Yes! With Character Animator, Adobe has developed a relatively easy-to-use interface that anyone can use easily.</p>

<p>Childhood crushes and idolization of <strong>animated characters</strong> were very normal things! <strong>Popular animated characters</strong> were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!</p>
<p>Today, in order to reminisce a little, we’ll be going through some of the more <strong>famous animated characters</strong>!</p>
<p>Although we initially promised only 15 <strong>animated characters</strong>, we’ve stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more <strong>popular animated characters</strong> to reminisce about! We’ve also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!</p>
<h3 id="01Mickey-Mouse"><a href="#01Mickey-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="01Mickey Mouse"></a>01Mickey Mouse</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Steamboat Willie (1928)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine</p>
<p>When it comes to admirable <strong>animated characters</strong>, Disney’s Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune! He merited the top spot simply for that fame, even though, in all honesty, his time on the big screen had been pretty limited (with his biggest performance having been from Fantasia).</p>

<h3 id="02Woody"><a href="#02Woody" class="headerlink" title="02Woody"></a>02Woody</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tom Hanks</p>
<p>We of course also cannot forget Toy Story’s Woody in a discussion of <strong>famous animated characters</strong>. This cowboy toy comes equipped with a pull-string that just oozes personality (both good and bad), leading up to a very satisfying movie-watching experience as we watch him grow from the selfish toy that he had been in the beginning to the generous, and forgiving toy that he developed into by the fourth movie in the series!</p>

<h3 id="03Buzz-Lightyear"><a href="#03Buzz-Lightyear" class="headerlink" title="03Buzz Lightyear"></a>03Buzz Lightyear</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tim Allen</p>
<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<h3 id="04Dory"><a href="#04Dory" class="headerlink" title="04Dory"></a>04Dory</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Finding Nemo (2003), Finding Dory (2016)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Finding Nemo (2003)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>Dory was undoubtedly the underdog of the Finding Nemo franchise! This lovable fish, <strong>Voiced by</strong> the equally loveable Ellen DeGeneres, stole the show and earned herself her own feature film that all the animated movie lovers came to watch in 2016! Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.</p>

<h3 id="05Totoro"><a href="#05Totoro" class="headerlink" title="05Totoro"></a>05Totoro</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Hitoshi Takagi</p>
<p>Speaking of cute characters, how can one forget about Totoro! Despite having been written in a different language, ‘My Neighbor Totoro’ has managed to burrow its way into the hearts of many a movie watcher. And of course, this is all things to the loveable animated character, Totoro — who is cuddly, gentle, and peaceful!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="06Genie"><a href="#06Genie" class="headerlink" title="06Genie"></a>06Genie</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Aladdin (1992), The Return of Jafar (1994), Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Aladdin (1992)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Robin Williams</p>
<p>When talking about <strong>animated characters</strong>, one must also not forget the phenomenal performance of Genie from the Aladdin franchise! <strong>Voiced by</strong> Robin Williams, Genie was brought to life in a way that changed the industry for good, bringing an influx of more lively voice acting in the future!</p>
<p>If you’re the type to want to <strong>make your animated character</strong>, taking inspiration from Robin William’s Genie would surely not lead you astray! In fact, you can get started on it today, if you wanted! All you have to do is pick up a good mic and a professional video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> Pro that can help you in your quest to bring your characters to life!</p>

<h3 id="07Wall-E"><a href="#07Wall-E" class="headerlink" title="07Wall-E"></a>07Wall-E</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Wall-E (2008)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Cameo in Cars (2006)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ben Burtt</p>
<p>Wall-E broke the box office for its underlying message regarding how we humans treat our world, but also because of its loveable characters! Who can say that they did not fall in love with Wall-E and his darling Eve? Despite his almost-mute character, he was brought to life in a way that made him very easy to love and would be remembered for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="08Donkey"><a href="#08Donkey" class="headerlink" title="08Donkey"></a>08Donkey</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek 3, Shrek Forever After, a Christmas short</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Shrek</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Eddie Murphy</p>
<p>Shrek’s Donkey is another one of those characters that you just cannot forget! <strong>Voiced by</strong> the hilarious Eddie Murphy, he added that constant spark of humor that kept the movie’s tone light and exciting, fully encompassing the kind of tone that the film was going for.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="09Cruella-de-Vil"><a href="#09Cruella-de-Vil" class="headerlink" title="09Cruella de Vil"></a>09Cruella de Vil</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: 101 Dalmatians</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: 101 Dalmatians</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Betty Lou Gerson</p>
<p>When it comes to classic villain <strong>animated characters</strong>, one cannot forget about the illustrious Cruella de Vil! This character was pure evil in a feminine form! Designed to be the enemy of puppy lovers everywhere all while bringing a little spice into what would have otherwise been a sweet, slice of life film.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="10Boo"><a href="#10Boo" class="headerlink" title="10Boo"></a>10Boo</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Monsters Inc.</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Monsters Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Mary Gibbs</p>
<p>Boo from Monsters Inc is one of the most <strong>popular animated characters</strong> on the big screen! She was loveable, sweet, and perfectly voice acted — bringing on some much-needed cute into the heart-warming story.</p>

<h3 id="11Mike-Wasowski"><a href="#11Mike-Wasowski" class="headerlink" title="11Mike Wasowski"></a>11Mike Wasowski</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Monsters Inc</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Monsters Inc</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Billy Crystal</p>
<p>Still on the Monster Inc train, we have Mike Wasowski! His refreshing character brought some levity into the story, bringing on some much-needed laughs and just, in general, providing a solid counterpart to Sulley!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="12Toothless"><a href="#12Toothless" class="headerlink" title="12Toothless"></a>12Toothless</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon, How to Train your Dragon 2</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="13Chihiro"><a href="#13Chihiro" class="headerlink" title="13Chihiro"></a>13Chihiro</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase</p>
<p>The story of Chihiro from ‘Spirited Away’ is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget! This character, if you weren’t aware, was also created by Miyazaki (the same creator of ‘Totoro!’) She’s a part of a long line of greatly designed and developed characters whose journey you just can’t look away from.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="14Lumiere"><a href="#14Lumiere" class="headerlink" title="14Lumiere"></a>14Lumiere</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991), The Enchanted Christmas (1997)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jerry Orbach</p>
<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved <strong>Disney Animated Characters</strong>, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (<strong>Voiced by</strong> Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the ‘Be Our Guest’ track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast’s love story.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="15Sophie"><a href="#15Sophie" class="headerlink" title="15Sophie"></a>15Sophie</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Chieko Baisho; Emily Mortimer &amp; Jean Simmons</p>
<p>To wrap up our main list, we have another Miyazaki character in the form of Sophie — from Howl’s Moving Castle! Howl’s Moving Castle is another beautiful classic that you just can’t help but love, and a lot of that is all thanks to its complex and believable heroine, Sophie!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #1: Baloo</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: The Jungle Book (1967), The Jungle Book 2 (2003)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: The Jungle Book (1967)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Phil Harris; John Goodman</p>
<p>For the first of our honorable mentions, we have Baloo from ‘The Jungle Book’! Baloo is soft and cuddly — perfectly loveable while providing sage advice for the main character! His performance in the film was certainly an unforgettable one (worth the repeat viewing!)</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #2: Maleficent</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Sleeping Beauty (1959)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Sleeping Beauty (1959)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Eleanor Audley</p>
<p>Maleficent from ‘Sleeping Beauty’ also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent’s LIVE action form merited a sequel.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Dumbo (1941)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Dumbo (1941)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>Dumbo joins the cast of cute and cuddly characters that manage to make an impact with little to no words! His amazing animation managed to convey his entire story despite his muteness, speaking to the great talent of his animators!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #4: Coraline</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Coraline (2008)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Coraline (2008)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Dakota Fanning</p>
<p>Coraline’s animation is certainly unique, but that’s one of the reasons why she and her film stand out so much! In terms of <strong>animated characters</strong>, Coraline stands out with her unique design and equally unique story. She’s certainly not a heroine that you should mess with!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #5: Jack Skellington</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Chris Sarandon, Henry Sellick (singing)</p>
<p>Although Jack Skellington’s film, ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’ may not be as well known as others, those that do know of it speak well of his character! His complex personality gives way for a very interesting tale, one that has captivated many an audience and merited repeat viewings (perfect for the holiday season!)</p>

<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Coraline (2008)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Coraline (2008)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Dakota Fanning</p>
<p>Coraline’s animation is certainly unique, but that’s one of the reasons why she and her film stand out so much! In terms of <strong>animated characters</strong>, Coraline stands out with her unique design and equally unique story. She’s certainly not a heroine that you should mess with!</p>

<p>Childhood crushes and idolization of <strong>animated characters</strong> were very normal things! <strong>Popular animated characters</strong> were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!</p>
<p>Today, in order to reminisce a little, we’ll be going through some of the more <strong>famous animated characters</strong>!</p>
<p>Although we initially promised only 15 <strong>animated characters</strong>, we’ve stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more <strong>popular animated characters</strong> to reminisce about! We’ve also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!</p>
<h3 id="01Mickey-Mouse-3"><a href="#01Mickey-Mouse-3" class="headerlink" title="01Mickey Mouse"></a>01Mickey Mouse</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Steamboat Willie (1928)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine</p>
<p>When it comes to admirable <strong>animated characters</strong>, Disney’s Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune! He merited the top spot simply for that fame, even though, in all honesty, his time on the big screen had been pretty limited (with his biggest performance having been from Fantasia).</p>

<h3 id="02Woody-3"><a href="#02Woody-3" class="headerlink" title="02Woody"></a>02Woody</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tom Hanks</p>
<p>We of course also cannot forget Toy Story’s Woody in a discussion of <strong>famous animated characters</strong>. This cowboy toy comes equipped with a pull-string that just oozes personality (both good and bad), leading up to a very satisfying movie-watching experience as we watch him grow from the selfish toy that he had been in the beginning to the generous, and forgiving toy that he developed into by the fourth movie in the series!</p>

<h3 id="03Buzz-Lightyear-3"><a href="#03Buzz-Lightyear-3" class="headerlink" title="03Buzz Lightyear"></a>03Buzz Lightyear</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tim Allen</p>
<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Finding Nemo (2003)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>Dory was undoubtedly the underdog of the Finding Nemo franchise! This lovable fish, <strong>Voiced by</strong> the equally loveable Ellen DeGeneres, stole the show and earned herself her own feature film that all the animated movie lovers came to watch in 2016! Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Hitoshi Takagi</p>
<p>Speaking of cute characters, how can one forget about Totoro! Despite having been written in a different language, ‘My Neighbor Totoro’ has managed to burrow its way into the hearts of many a movie watcher. And of course, this is all things to the loveable animated character, Totoro — who is cuddly, gentle, and peaceful!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Aladdin (1992)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Robin Williams</p>
<p>When talking about <strong>animated characters</strong>, one must also not forget the phenomenal performance of Genie from the Aladdin franchise! <strong>Voiced by</strong> Robin Williams, Genie was brought to life in a way that changed the industry for good, bringing an influx of more lively voice acting in the future!</p>
<p>If you’re the type to want to <strong>make your animated character</strong>, taking inspiration from Robin William’s Genie would surely not lead you astray!

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Cameo in Cars (2006)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ben Burtt</p>
<p>Wall-E broke the box office for its underlying message regarding how we humans treat our world, but also because of its loveable characters! Who can say that they did not fall in love with Wall-E and his darling Eve? Despite his almost-mute character, he was brought to life in a way that made him very easy to love and would be remembered for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Shrek</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Eddie Murphy</p>
<p>Shrek’s Donkey is another one of those characters that you just cannot forget! <strong>Voiced by</strong> the hilarious Eddie Murphy, he added that constant spark of humor that kept the movie’s tone light and exciting, fully encompassing the kind of tone that the film was going for.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: 101 Dalmatians</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Betty Lou Gerson</p>
<p>When it comes to classic villain <strong>animated characters</strong>, one cannot forget about the illustrious Cruella de Vil! This character was pure evil in a feminine form! Designed to be the enemy of puppy lovers everywhere all while bringing a little spice into what would have otherwise been a sweet, slice of life film.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="10Boo-3"><a href="#10Boo-3" class="headerlink" title="10Boo"></a>10Boo</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Monsters Inc.</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Monsters Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Mary Gibbs</p>
<p>Boo from Monsters Inc is one of the most <strong>popular animated characters</strong> on the big screen! She was loveable, sweet, and perfectly voice acted — bringing on some much-needed cute into the heart-warming story.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Monsters Inc</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Billy Crystal</p>
<p>Still on the Monster Inc train, we have Mike Wasowski! His refreshing character brought some levity into the story, bringing on some much-needed laughs and just, in general, providing a solid counterpart to Sulley!</p>

<h3 id="12Toothless-3"><a href="#12Toothless-3" class="headerlink" title="12Toothless"></a>12Toothless</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon, How to Train your Dragon 2</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="13Chihiro-3"><a href="#13Chihiro-3" class="headerlink" title="13Chihiro"></a>13Chihiro</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase</p>
<p>The story of Chihiro from ‘Spirited Away’ is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget! This character, if you weren’t aware, was also created by Miyazaki (the same creator of ‘Totoro!’) She’s a part of a long line of greatly designed and developed characters whose journey you just can’t look away from.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="14Lumiere-3"><a href="#14Lumiere-3" class="headerlink" title="14Lumiere"></a>14Lumiere</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991), The Enchanted Christmas (1997)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jerry Orbach</p>
<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved <strong>Disney Animated Characters</strong>, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (<strong>Voiced by</strong> Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the ‘Be Our Guest’ track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast’s love story.</p>

<h3 id="15Sophie-3"><a href="#15Sophie-3" class="headerlink" title="15Sophie"></a>15Sophie</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Chieko Baisho; Emily Mortimer &amp; Jean Simmons</p>
<p>To wrap up our main list, we have another Miyazaki character in the form of Sophie — from Howl’s Moving Castle! Howl’s Moving Castle is another beautiful classic that you just can’t help but love, and a lot of that is all thanks to its complex and believable heroine, Sophie!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #1: Baloo</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: The Jungle Book (1967), The Jungle Book 2 (2003)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: The Jungle Book (1967)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Phil Harris; John Goodman</p>
<p>For the first of our honorable mentions, we have Baloo from ‘The Jungle Book’! Baloo is soft and cuddly — perfectly loveable while providing sage advice for the main character! His performance in the film was certainly an unforgettable one (worth the repeat viewing!)</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #2: Maleficent</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Sleeping Beauty (1959)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Sleeping Beauty (1959)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Eleanor Audley</p>
<p>Maleficent from ‘Sleeping Beauty’ also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent’s LIVE action form merited a sequel.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Dumbo (1941)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Dumbo (1941)</p>
