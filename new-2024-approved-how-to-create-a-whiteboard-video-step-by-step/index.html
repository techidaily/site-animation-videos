<h2 id="Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video"><a href="#Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?"></a>Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?</h2><p>To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level.

<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images.

<h2 id="Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?"></a>Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?</h2><p>To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script-3"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-Create-Images-3"><a href="#Step-3-Create-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create Images"></a>Step 3: Create Images</h4><p>If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.</p>

<h4 id="Step-4-Animate-Those-Images-3"><a href="#Step-4-Animate-Those-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Animate Those Images"></a>Step 4: Animate Those Images</h4><p>Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.</p>

Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.</p>

You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.</p>
<p>By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.</p>
<h4 id="Personalize-the-Images-3"><a href="#Personalize-the-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Personalize the Images"></a>Personalize the Images</h4><p>Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project. And if you are wondering how you will edit your video, we recommend <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cinderella</p>

<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies.

<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time.
