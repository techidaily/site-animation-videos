<h3 id="Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop"></a>Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Launch-your-software"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-your-software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch your software"></a>Step 1: Launch your software</h4><p> Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported"><a href="#Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get your video clip imported"></a>Step 2: Get your video clip imported</h4><p> As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings"></a>Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.</p>
<p> It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:</p>
<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.</p>
<p><strong>Dither:</strong> The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.</p>
<p><strong>Lossy:</strong> If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file"><a href="#Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file"></a>Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file</h4><p> When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose “Save for Web” option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.</p>

In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop’s animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:</p>
<h4 id="1-Step-1"><a href="#1-Step-1" class="headerlink" title="1.  Step 1"></a>1.  Step 1</h4><p> First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts.

It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.</p>
<p> Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.</p>
<p> All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File &gt; New option to start working with a new project.

Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.</p>
<p> Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have “Load Files into Stack” feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Step-2"><a href="#2-Step-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Step 2"></a>2.  Step 2</h4><p> Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.</p>
<p> As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose “Make Frames from Layer” option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.</p>
<h4 id="3-Step-3"><a href="#3-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Step 3"></a>3.  Step 3</h4><p> Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.</p>

<p> Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-a-GIF-in-Photoshop-3"><a href="#How-to-make-a-GIF-in-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="How to make a GIF in Photoshop"></a>How to make a GIF in Photoshop</h2><ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop"></a>Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Launch-your-software-3"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-your-software-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch your software"></a>Step 1: Launch your software</h4><p> Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported-3"><a href="#Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get your video clip imported"></a>Step 2: Get your video clip imported</h4><p> As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings-3"><a href="#Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings"></a>Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.</p>
<p> It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:</p>
<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.</p>
<p><strong>Dither:</strong> The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.</p>
<p><strong>Lossy:</strong> If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file-3"><a href="#Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file"></a>Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file</h4><p> When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose “Save for Web” option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.</p>

<h3 id="Method-2-Make-a-GIF-from-Still-Photos-in-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Method-2-Make-a-GIF-from-Still-Photos-in-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop"></a>Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop</h3><p> It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop’s animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:</p>
<h4 id="1-Step-1-3"><a href="#1-Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="1.  Step 1"></a>1.  Step 1</h4><p> First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts. It will provide you an option for Load Files into Stack. Now hit browse button and choose your images from desktop folder that you further want to use for development of GIF image. Hit OK. It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.</p>
<p> Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.</p>
<p> All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File &gt; New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.</p>
<p> Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have “Load Files into Stack” feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Step-2-3"><a href="#2-Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="2.  Step 2"></a>2.  Step 2</h4><p> Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.</p>
<p> As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose “Make Frames from Layer” option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.</p>
<h4 id="3-Step-3-3"><a href="#3-Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Step 3"></a>3.  Step 3</h4><p> Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.</p>

Various streaming platforms like YouTube have allowed different creators to <strong>draw cartoon videos</strong> and publish them as they want. It has long been said that cartoons are specifically made for kids to enjoy on Saturday morning, but this is no longer the case as adults now enjoy watching cartoons in their free time.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Do-You-Remember-the-Very-Popular-Simpsons"><a href="#Part-1-Do-You-Remember-the-Very-Popular-Simpsons" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Do You Remember the Very Popular Simpsons?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Do You Remember the Very Popular Simpsons?</strong></h2><p>The Simpsons is an American animated cartoonist Matt Groening created for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that’s pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel.

<p>There has been an advancement in the cartoon since the last publication made by “Paste” (a 5,800-word short story by Henry James). However, traditional cable networks have created exciting and new worlds and characters. Various streaming platforms like YouTube have allowed different creators to <strong>draw cartoon videos</strong> and publish them as they want. It has long been said that cartoons are specifically made for kids to enjoy on Saturday morning, but this is no longer the case as adults now enjoy watching cartoons in their free time.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

<p>However, here are the ten best cartoon shows that have existed since the Simpsons:</p>
<h3 id="01Futurama-1"><a href="#01Futurama-1" class="headerlink" title="01Futurama"></a>01Futurama</h3><p>This <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that’s pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.</p>

<h3 id="02The-Critic-1"><a href="#02The-Critic-1" class="headerlink" title="02The Critic"></a>02The Critic</h3><p>This cartoon series was first created in 1994 by the Simpson’s writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss. This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor’s non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz’s Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.</p>

<h3 id="03Bojack-Horseman-1"><a href="#03Bojack-Horseman-1" class="headerlink" title="03Bojack Horseman"></a>03Bojack Horseman</h3><p>Bojack Horseman is a <strong>dumb cartoon character</strong> series first created on August 22, 2014. However, four (4) days later, the series was renewed for a second season, released on July 17, 2015.

<h3 id="04Family-Guy-1"><a href="#04Family-Guy-1" class="headerlink" title="04Family Guy"></a>04Family Guy</h3><p>Family Guy, the <strong>snoopy cartoon</strong> series, was first created on January 31, 1999, which goes for anything for a laugh style. However, you might not like the Griffin family or the other residents of Quahog, but you have to admit that the show stumbles on a great joke.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>
<h3 id="04Intro-to-Rigging-Software"><a href="#04Intro-to-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="04Intro to Rigging Software"></a>04Intro to Rigging Software</h3><p>You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.</p>
<p>Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.</p>
<p>Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.</p>
<p>Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.</p>
<p>You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.</p>

The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>

                ></p>
<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>

<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>
