<p>The function of <strong>character rigging</strong> can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Intro-to-Character-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-Intro-to-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging"></a>Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging</h2><p>As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.</p>
<p>Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).</p>
<p>The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.</p>
<p>Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.</p>
<p>Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.</p>
<p>This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.</p>

Are There Any Plugins or Easy"></a>Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy</h2><p><strong>How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy</strong></p>
<p>When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.</p>
<p>The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>In <strong>Cinema, character rigging</strong> has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.</p>
<p>Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.</p>
<p>The process;</p>
<p><strong>Weight Painting:</strong> An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.</p>
<p><strong>Placing Bones:</strong> After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics:</strong> Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon’s tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Constraints:</strong> The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can’t do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation Skeletons:</strong> Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.</p>
<p><strong>Create an animated movie:</strong> You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with <strong>Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.</strong> Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigs:</strong> Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.</p>

<p>The function of <strong>character rigging</strong> can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.</p>

<p>When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.</p>
<p>The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>In <strong>Cinema, character rigging</strong> has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.</p>
<p>Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.</p>
<p>The process;</p>
<p><strong>Weight Painting:</strong> An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.</p>
<p><strong>Placing Bones:</strong> After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics:</strong> Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon’s tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Constraints:</strong> The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can’t do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation Skeletons:</strong> Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.</p>
<p><strong>Create an animated movie:</strong> You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with <strong>Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.</strong> Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigs:</strong> Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.</p>

<p>The function of <strong>character rigging</strong> can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.</p>

It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.</p>
<p>Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).</p>
<p>The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.</p>
<p>Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.</p>
<p>Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.</p>
<p>This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.</p>
<p>Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.</p>

The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.</p>
<p>You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don’t. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.</p>

Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.</p>

Are There Any Plugins or Easy"></a>Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy</h2><p><strong>How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy</strong></p>
<p>When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.</p>
<p>The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>In <strong>Cinema, character rigging</strong> has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.</p>
<p>Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.</p>
<p>The process;</p>
<p><strong>Weight Painting:</strong> An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.</p>
<p><strong>Placing Bones:</strong> After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics:</strong> Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon’s tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.</p>
<p><strong>Applying Constraints:</strong> The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can’t do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation Skeletons:</strong> Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.</p>
<p><strong>Create an animated movie:</strong> You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with <strong>Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.</strong> Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigs:</strong> Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-3"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can’t be artistic with it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

<h3 id="02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker"><a href="#02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker" class="headerlink" title="02Color Cartoon Caricature Maker"></a>02<strong>Color Cartoon Caricature Maker</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>caricature maker</strong> app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a <strong>political caricature</strong> of famous individuals and politicians. It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style.

<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

(A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-2"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-2" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-2"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-2"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-2" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-2"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-2"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-2" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-3"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-3" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-3"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-3"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-3" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-3"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-3"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>
