We don’t get much opportunity to meet familiar faces too often so why not just try and animate still images of relatives. Now we already know how we can start animating images on apps but restoring original images maybe a tad more complicated than that. This time a bit of the animation is dependent on the physical state of the picture so be sure it’s in mint condition.</p>
<p>These photos can be restored or manipulated digitally with the help of smart AI. We have listed down some of the <strong>apps</strong> <strong>to animate old photos</strong> and reconstruct faces;</p>
<h3 id="01Photos-Revive-3"><a href="#01Photos-Revive-3" class="headerlink" title="01Photos Revive"></a>01Photos Revive</h3><p>You can add colour to old worn out photos and make them look more realistic in terms of tonal colorization using artificial intelligence. The app also asks you recollect any details of the photo that you might remember in terms of the image.</p>

<p>This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of <strong>animate rigging</strong></p>
<p>To help them out (as well as other <strong>animation rigging</strong> beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-8"><a href="#In-this-article-8" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [The Only Guide You’ll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation](#Part 1)</p>

This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

<h3 id="02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging"><a href="#02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging"></a>02<strong>An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>
<h3 id="04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving"><a href="#04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving" class="headerlink" title="04Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving"></a>04<strong>Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving</strong></h3><p>Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Animate-Rigging"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Animate-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Animate Rigging?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do You Animate Rigging?</strong></h2><p>Now, onto actually talking about how you can start <strong>animate rigging</strong>. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging4.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>
<h3 id="02Beginners-Tutorial-on-Shape-Rigging"><a href="#02Beginners-Tutorial-on-Shape-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging"></a>02<strong>Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging</strong></h3><p>This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:</p>
<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="03How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works"><a href="#03How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works" class="headerlink" title="03How Auto Rig Mapping Works"></a>03<strong>How Auto Rig Mapping Works</strong></h3><p>Auto-rigging is the use of pre-made rigs in order to simplify the process. The tool automatically maps the areas where the characters and the rig are given the same symbol names and snaps them together to create joints for a motion to be applied.</p>
<h3 id="04How-Visual-Rig-Mapping-Works"><a href="#04How-Visual-Rig-Mapping-Works" class="headerlink" title="04How Visual Rig Mapping Works"></a>04<strong>How Visual Rig Mapping Works</strong></h3><p>Visual mapping is a lot more complicated the auto-rig mapping, so it’s not something you want to jump into immediately. However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>Manually make connections starting with the joints.</p>
<p>Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.</p>
<p>Motion can then be added to the timeline.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-4"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-4" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Start off on the right footing by learning the basics of animation! These days, there are more options than ever, with the modern 3D animation rigging style now just as popular as the more classic 2D animation style.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The best way to learn animation rigging is to practice! Structured guides can help you get to the point of almost mastery, but it’s not until you start playing with the tools of your craft that you can truly learn how to create beautiful animations!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some of the more complex functions of rigging require a lot of patience, so make sure that you always go into your projects with a level-head. And, just to be sure, invest in tools that will help rather than hinder your progress! There are many advanced software out there that can help you improve more easily.</p>

<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>

This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-1"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"

<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>

<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-2"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-2"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-2" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>

<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>

<h3 id="02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging-3"><a href="#02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging"></a>02<strong>An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-3"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>
<h3 id="04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving-3"><a href="#04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving-3" class="headerlink" title="04Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving"></a>04<strong>Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving</strong></h3><p>Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>

This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-3"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging4.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>
<h3 id="02Beginners-Tutorial-on-Shape-Rigging-3"><a href="#02Beginners-Tutorial-on-Shape-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging"></a>02<strong>Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging</strong></h3><p>This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:</p>
<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

<h3 id="03How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works-3"><a href="#03How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works-3" class="headerlink" title="03How Auto Rig Mapping Works"></a>03<strong>How Auto Rig Mapping Works</strong></h3><p>Auto-rigging is the use of pre-made rigs in order to simplify the process. The tool automatically maps the areas where the characters and the rig are given the same symbol names and snaps them together to create joints for a motion to be applied.</p>
<h3 id="04How-Visual-Rig-Mapping-Works-3"><a href="#04How-Visual-Rig-Mapping-Works-3" class="headerlink" title="04How Visual Rig Mapping Works"></a>04<strong>How Visual Rig Mapping Works</strong></h3><p>Visual mapping is a lot more complicated the auto-rig mapping, so it’s not something you want to jump into immediately. However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>Manually make connections starting with the joints.</p>
<p>Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.</p>
<p>Motion can then be added to the timeline.</p>

In the following section of this article, let us keep our focus on learning about some of the most amazing tips and tricks to upgrade your Insta story slideshow to the next level:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>A Compact Photo Album</strong></p>
<p>Do you land among those social media freaks how want to share just every moment of your day with your peers, or are you confused on selecting the best photos and videos of a cherished event, vacation or bringing home a new utility and end up posting a heap of media on your social media handles?</p>
<p>If your answer is a guilty ‘Yes’, you can try on giving up the habit now by creating an <strong>Instagram story photo slideshow</strong> to share mini album of your most loved images from the event or vacation. You can use the feature to create a collection of amazing videos as well and share it too with your friends on social media without the guilt of becoming a feed-hog.</p>
<p>Want a practical experience of using Instagram slideshows? See through the following tutorial to understand the exact creation process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Choose the First Image</strong></p>
<p>Begin with selecting the first image for your slideshow, just as you would ideally do for a normal, single image Instagram feed and long press the same.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Confirming the Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the bottom right corner of your selected image to locate a button similar to a photo slideshow. Tap the button to see a ‘1’ inscribed in a blue circle appear on your chosen image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Make Further Selections</strong></p>
<p>You can now proceed to select other images or videos for the slideshow, in a similar fashion as the first one. You are allowed to include a maximum of 10 media files within the slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>Tap the ‘Next’ button when you have finished making the required selections. The editor interface will now open to let you customize the selected images with a series of effects and filters, both one at a time, as well as the entire set altogether. You can also work with modifying the order of appearance of the photos and videos if required.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: The Final Touches</strong></p>
<p>Once you are done with the editing process, continue to follow the remaining steps, as you would do to create a normal Instagram post. You can include captions, locations and tag your peers on the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Time to Share!</strong></p>
<p>Your Instagram slideshow is ready to be posted. Upload it either to your feed or story to receive a hoard of likes and comments!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animated Text Overlays</strong></p>
<p>If your Instagram story slideshows are missing out on the visual spunk, try complimenting their images and videos with animated transitions and text overlays. Short and quick animations are the best ways to enhance a slideshow story with an eye catching effect. Applying a variety of text overlays would help to keep the audience curious about the next visual delight.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer a Vertical Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>While the landscape mode tends to ward off certain portions of the visual media from a slideshow being played across multiple sized screens, using the portrait mode with a vertical aspect ratio suits best to almost every screen size. Taking care of this fact will ensure that your audience does not get distracted with the semi visible contents of the slideshow story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Choose Your Editing Effects Wisely</strong></p>
<p>Regardless of the slideshow creation tool you prefer, there are a diversity of effects, templates, design elements and filters to uplift your craft with the perfect look. However, you should be cautious enough while making your choice so that the balance of colors, fonts and themes is affordably maintained, lest you would end up with a messy and loud Instagram story slideshow, that would not gather much appeal.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

                      alt="add feet skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

This is a widely recognized American cartoon. Many people can relate to Charlie. Charlie is shy, nervous, and lacks confidence. These characteristics make him relatable to a chunk of common people. Charlie is referred to as the “Loveable Loser.”Charlie is an overwhelmingly short and stout character physically. Have you ever imagined how Charlie’s skeleton version would look? Here is how the <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> of Charlie would look.</p>

<h3 id="02Fred-Flintstone-3"><a href="#02Fred-Flintstone-3" class="headerlink" title="02Fred Flintstone"></a>02Fred Flintstone</h3><p>I have known very few people who do not know about Fred Flintstone. Fred Flinstone is the protagonist of the famous American sitcom show Yabba-Dabba-Dinosaurs and the entire franchise. The Flinstone is another show that features Fred with his family. Of course, the show’s main attraction is the Flinstone family and the way this show is set. This show is set in a way that romanticizes a family living in a cave. Coming to talk about skeletons, have you ever thought that what if a <strong>skeleton cartoon show</strong> version of The Flintstone were made. How would this short, fat man with almost a square look as a skeleton? We can look up here how the skeleton version of Fred Flintstone looks:</p>

<h3 id="03Bubbles-3"><a href="#03Bubbles-3" class="headerlink" title="03Bubbles"></a>03Bubbles</h3><p>The Bubble is one of the main characters of the popular TV cartoon show Powerpuff girls. The other protagonists are Blossom and Buttercup, her sisters. The Bubble is named Bubble because she is the bubbliest and most fun-loving among the three sisters. Bubble is a sweet little girl with a round face and big round eyes and short limbs. These characteristics in this character make it look cuter. But to think, how would we imagine Bubble in a skeleton version. This is how Bubble would look like a skeleton.</p>

<h3 id="04Dexter-3"><a href="#04Dexter-3" class="headerlink" title="04Dexter"></a>04Dexter</h3><p>Dexter is the protagonist in the show Dexter’s Laboratory. Dexter is one of the most outstanding kid scientists who have made great inventions in his secret laboratory. It would be more appropriate to call Dexter an anti-heroic protagonist. He works in his secret laboratory for various projects like stopping bullying worldwide. Dexter is a short young boy with curly hair. Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious. But this is how Dexter would look like a <strong>skeleton cartoon.</strong></p>

<h3 id="05Pikachu-3"><a href="#05Pikachu-3" class="headerlink" title="05Pikachu"></a>05Pikachu</h3><p>Pikachu is one of the characters or one of the Pokémons in the famous animated Japanese series Pokémon. Pikachu is a small yellow furry Pokémon. It seems very sweet to the audience and the general public, but it acquires a dangerous skill to give out an electric shock. This small yellow furry creature has featured in many films with the protagonist of the famous show Pokémon Ash Ketchum. This cartoon character has a presence in the fashion industry. It has been used to fashion dresses, bags, and many more. How would it be if we sat to think of a skeleton version of this furry creature? This may not a pleasant experience for everyone. The perfect way to demonstrate pikachu as a skeleton version would be:</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

                      alt="add feet skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 19:</strong> You can color your skeleton drawing or give your shading style after your skeleton drawing is done.</p>
<p>You can make quirky <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> animations and compile them to a video, adding music effects. You might think you need different apps for the video and the audio editing part. That might be the case for other apps.
