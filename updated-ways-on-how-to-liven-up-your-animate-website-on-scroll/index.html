This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.</strong></h2><p>This is a series for people who want to learn how to create <strong>3D blender animation</strong> characters from keeping a reference image. Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>

Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Samples-for-Well-Done-Animated-GIF-3"><a href="#Part-2-Samples-for-Well-Done-Animated-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Samples for Well Done Animated GIF"></a>Part 2 Samples for Well Done Animated GIF</h2><p>They say that an image is worth looking at a thousand words, so you must consider an animated GIF even more regarding this statement. In the current scenario, email marketers are revamping the boundaries of email design by including well-done animated GIFs to showcase their services and products in action.</p>
<p>Here is a collection of 5 beautiful samples of well-done animated GIFs in email marketing that proved to be very creative, engaging, and colorful.</p>
<h3 id="1-ShoeMint-3"><a href="#1-ShoeMint-3" class="headerlink" title="1. ShoeMint"></a>1. ShoeMint</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-4.gif"
                      alt="shoemint"
                ></p>
<p>This cute GIF syncs pretty well with the ShoeMint’s email marketing template’s title – “C’mon, Get Happy!.” You can smile when you see the colorful socks swaying in a carefree manner.</p>
<h3 id="2-Mr-Porter-3"><a href="#2-Mr-Porter-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Mr. Porter"></a>2. Mr. Porter</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-3.gif"
                      alt="mr porter"
                ></p>
<p>This is an animated fireplace in the email marketing newsletter of Mr. Porter. It gives a pretty cozy and warm feel and atmosphere to the entire image, which is what they’re looking for or wandering for with the casual clothes the man is wearing.</p>
<h3 id="3-American-Apparel-3"><a href="#3-American-Apparel-3" class="headerlink" title="3. American Apparel"></a>3. American Apparel</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-1.gif"
                      alt="american apparel"
                ></p>
<p>American Apparel sells “power washed” T-shirts to make them “super soft.”</p>
<p>This critical merit would not attract many users if it weren’t for simulating the animated GIF of the T-shirts getting washed in an imaginary washing machine.</p>
<h3 id="4-Looper-3"><a href="#4-Looper-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Looper"></a>4. Looper</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-2.gif"
                      alt="looper"
                ></p>
<p>One of the major motion pictures was Looper, that introduced us to the world’s first “official” GIF movie poster when the film premiered. The clock GIF inside the first O is exclusively creative, and the incredible animated dust effect suggests that both characters are fading away due to the events in the movie.</p>
<h3 id="5-West-Elm-3"><a href="#5-West-Elm-3" class="headerlink" title="5. West Elm"></a>5. West Elm</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-5.gif"
                      alt="west elm"
                ></p>
<p>West Elm offers modern furniture and various home decorations. In this email newsletter, they are presenting a selection of lamps, and what better way to showcase them than a GIF of them turning on at the same time.</p>
<p>Thus, these were the top five samples of our animated GIF tutorial you can take cue from right away.</p>
<h5 id="Versatile-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora-4"><a href="#Versatile-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora-4" class="headerlink" title="Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora"></a>Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora</h5><p>An easy yet powerful editor</p>
<p>Numerous effects to choose from</p>

<h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>While the lots of GIF makers available might prove to be good at times, they won’t be able to provide the value you want all the time. That’s what makes Wondershare Filmora an ideal pick to use for finishing well done animated GIF and one that will undoubtedly deliver on its promise. Creating a well-done animated GIF is simple, easy, and quick with Filmora. Have you tried it out yet?</p>
