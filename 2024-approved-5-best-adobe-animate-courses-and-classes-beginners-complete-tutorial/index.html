Sometimes things are very hard to explain with the still images whereas with the help of a few seconds of motion graphics you can clear everything perfectly.</p>
<p>If we talk about animation then this is a term under which motion graphics falls. Animation is used for more than 1years. So, we can say motion graphics are a part of animation itself. Any technique in the world which helps users to move static images or objects is known as animation. It can be Claymation, anime, cartoons, or motion graphics.</p>
