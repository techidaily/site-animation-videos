<p>With present-day technology, <strong>3D animation</strong> has reached all spheres be it entertainment, advertising, architecture, education, and much more. With the increasing use of 3D animation, there is a rise in the tools and programs used for creating such animations.</p>
<p>So, to help you get all the details about 3D animation, <strong>3D modelling and animation process</strong>, best tools, tips, and tricks, keep reading the following parts.</p>

The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating <strong>animation 3D models</strong>.</p>
<p>The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.</p>

Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Modeling"><a href="#01Modeling" class="headerlink" title="01Modeling"></a>01Modeling</h3><p>The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.</p>
<h3 id="02Layout-and-animation"><a href="#02Layout-and-animation" class="headerlink" title="02Layout and animation"></a>02Layout and animation</h3><p>The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="03Rendering"><a href="#03Rendering" class="headerlink" title="03Rendering"></a>03Rendering</h3><p>The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.</p>
<p>After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.</p>

The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating <strong>animation 3D models</strong>.</p>
<p>The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.</p>

The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating <strong>animation 3D models</strong>.</p>
<p>The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.</p>

Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Modeling-3"><a href="#01Modeling-3" class="headerlink" title="01Modeling"></a>01Modeling</h3><p>The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.</p>
<h3 id="02Layout-and-animation-3"><a href="#02Layout-and-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Layout and animation"></a>02Layout and animation</h3><p>The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.</p>
<h3 id="03Rendering-3"><a href="#03Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="03Rendering"></a>03Rendering</h3><p>The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.</p>
<p>After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-10-Photo-Animator-Templates-to-Bring-Your-Images-to-Life"><a href="#02Best-10-Photo-Animator-Templates-to-Bring-Your-Images-to-Life" class="headerlink" title="02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life"></a>02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life</h3><p><strong>3D motion photo animator</strong></p>
<p>The first tool on the list of <strong>3d photo animators online</strong>is an excellent tool called 3D motion photo Animator. The tool helps to split landscape shots into numerous panels depending on the distance of the object from the camera. Furthermore, the plug-in also adds a soft parallax movement into the layers, giving the final image a beautiful 3D effect. The tool also has several editing options and a wide range of lens flare. The animator tool allows you to tweak the weather by using the weather effect options available in the tool.</p>
<p><strong>3D photo animator</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>3d animation photo maker online</strong> takes the hype of the parallax effect in animation to a whole different level. The animator allows you to add parallax effects to any still image to make it appear 3 dimensional. Moreover, you can also add depth to the animated image to enhance the 3 dimensional effects and make it appear more realistic.</p>
<p><strong>Live photo animation</strong></p>
<p>Live photo animation is another seamless tool that offers <strong>free 3d motion graphics</strong>. The tool which is mainly meant for animation gives you the ability to mask the object and a keyframe from vivid natural movements. Once the subject and the background have been isolated and processed, they work independently from each other. This means that, due to independent operation, live photo animation becomes even more realistic since the subject can be animated without affecting the background. The tool also has cool zooming and 3D tracking effects.</p>
<p><strong>Easy 3D face photo Animator</strong></p>
<p>Most tools for <strong>3d photo animation online</strong> fail to make the image look completely 3 dimensional. Even after the animation is performed, the people and the objects continue to look 2 dimensional. However easy 3D face photo Animator solves the problem. Using this tool, you can individually animate a face and make it 3 dimensional. It uses several panels to recreate the effect that’d be provided by a video recorder.</p>
<p><strong>Live photo Animator</strong></p>
<p>Looking for an animating tool to animate still images and transform them into stunning videos like action pictures? Live photo Animator is just the perfect tool for you then. The tool has a simple interface and helps generate realistic 3d action images. The plug-in works on the principle of duplicating action elements in an image. These action images include water, dust, fire, and other different kinds of moving objects in an image.</p>
<p><strong>Photo Animator tool</strong></p>
<p>The photo Animator tool kit is a great tool to generate animated 3D images. This quick time-saving tool is your go-to tool for photo effects and zooming. Moreover, the pack also consists of 50 preset animation templates that you can choose from. All you need to do is drag and drop the still images into the tool, and then you need to select the template that you’d like to apply to the image. The tool then processes the image and animates it to convert the still image into a 3d one.</p>
<p><strong>Media animator</strong></p>
<p>Think of smooth and seamless media transitions? Media animator is the perfect tool for you. This software offers a set of seamless and dynamically animated media transitions. The smooth transition effects make the images produced by this tool perfect for using the 3D animations in your official presentations and slideshows.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

(It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily.

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator.

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily.

This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<h3 id="05Express-Animate-3"><a href="#05Express-Animate-3" class="headerlink" title="05Express Animate"></a>05Express Animate</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $60 (full license)</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you’ll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.</p>

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too!

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>
