<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Animation, Action, Adventure</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: TV-Y7</p>
<p><strong>Metascore</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p><strong>Director</strong>: Aaron Hammersley, Dominic Bisignano, Brett Varon, Sabrina Cotugno, Piero Piluso, Tyler Chen, Giancarlo Volpe, David Wasson, Michael Mullen , John Davis Infantino, and Amelia Lorenz.</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong>: 7.9</p>
<p><strong>Votes</strong>: 13,266</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, ‘Star vs. the Forces of Evil’ This is an American animated ‘magical-girl’ television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)</p>
<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand — only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully</p>
<h2 id="Top-9-Gargoyles"><a href="#Top-9-Gargoyles" class="headerlink" title="Top 9   Gargoyles"></a>Top 9   <strong>Gargoyles</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1994–1996 [2 Seasons, 30m per episode]</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We go back into the older <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called ‘Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles’ instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action&#x2F;adventure show.</p>
<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.</p>

Having aired between 2006 to 2016 with exactly 125 episodes around 30 minutes long.</p>
<p>The demographics for this one mainly comprises of very young children. But, if you like, it’s a safe-for-viewing show that you can have your kids watch and keep distracted And, perhaps, along the way, you can find some joy in these classic characters coming back to life.</p>

It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it’s not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it’s sure to provide a good time</p>

<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

<p>Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.</p>

<p>The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are dozen animated films that were way ahead of their time and were discontinued as the medium was seen more to be specifically directed for children only. Tim Burton’s creation ‘Frankenweenie’ was considered a ‘love letter’ to the Golden Age of Horror films. It was considered too dark for the average viewer so the director was later let go by Disney.</p>

<p>A more somber attempt at stop motion films was Paranorman. It featured printed faces in the characters which needed a new and innovative creative approach. People experienced ground breaking characterization of an openly gay character in the film which was a milestone in terms of mainstream animated films.

It went to becoming an Oscar winning work of art.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Victor Van Dort (Corpse Bride):</strong> The persona of a handsome man in his prime. Short and messy brown vest over a slim structure with big brown eyes. The protagonist of the corpse bride, Victor is a character in conflict stuck within an epic love triangle involving the dead. This amazing dark satire brings out the best in clay animation with precise movements and amazing music.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rocky (Chicken Run):</strong> Mel Gibson went out on a foot with Rocky, though he is known for the same. Rocky is the second character with prominence in the film. The plot is about chickens attempting to escape their inevitable demise. Rocky crash lands in the coop pretending to have figured out how to fly.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Coraline:</strong> Not your everyday story about an eleven year old. Coraline Jones continues to haunt&#x2F;impact us all even today and has a strong cult backing. It was initially meant to be live action but was later shifted to Claymation which took over four years to make.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Shaun the Sheep:</strong> Shaun is a sheep (obviously) who goes on world adventures. The movies was featured as the TV spin off. The character was meant to appeal to both children and family.

It went to becoming an Oscar winning work of art.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Victor Van Dort (Corpse Bride):</strong> The persona of a handsome man in his prime. Short and messy brown vest over a slim structure with big brown eyes. The protagonist of the corpse bride, Victor is a character in conflict stuck within an epic love triangle involving the dead. This amazing dark satire brings out the best in clay animation with precise movements and amazing music.</p>

The plot is about chickens attempting to escape their inevitable demise. Rocky crash lands in the coop pretending to have figured out how to fly.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Coraline:</strong> Not your everyday story about an eleven year old. Coraline Jones continues to haunt&#x2F;impact us all even today and has a strong cult backing. It was initially meant to be live action but was later shifted to Claymation which took over four years to make.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Shaun the Sheep:</strong> Shaun is a sheep (obviously) who goes on world adventures. The movies was featured as the TV spin off. The character was meant to appeal to both children and family. The entire movie was dependant on movement and expressions rather than dialogue making Claymation the perfect medium to bring out the character.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw a circle that would form Stitch’s head</p>

                      alt="draw a circle for its head"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Using a long curved line, draw an irregular peanut shape beneath the head to represent its body.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Draw Stitch’s outstretched arm using a pair of curved lines and small “C” shaped lines to represent the fingers. Use short lines to connect the fingers. Draw small “V” shapes at the tip of the fingers for the triangular claws.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other. Sketch too long curved lines to show the mouth and small blonde triangles for the teeth. Above the eyes and nose, draw curved lines.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw a circle that would form Stitch’s head</p>

                      alt="draw a circle for its head"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Using a long curved line, draw an irregular peanut shape beneath the head to represent its body.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Draw Stitch’s outstretched arm using a pair of curved lines and small “C” shaped lines to represent the fingers. Use short lines to connect the fingers. Draw small “V” shapes at the tip of the fingers for the triangular claws.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other. Sketch too long curved lines to show the mouth and small blonde triangles for the teeth. Above the eyes and nose, draw curved lines.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

                      alt="draw the head and chest"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Draw his arm and waist</p>
<p>Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Draw his legs</p>
<p>Here, we shall portray Captain America in action. Use curved lines to show his extended right leg with boots. The left leg should appear more petite.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Draw his shield</p>
<p>Against his right arm, carefully draw a flattened circular shape. You can achieve this by drawing concentric circles with a large star in the middle. Draw his arm poking out from behind his shield.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Draw Stitch’s outstretched arm using a pair of curved lines and small “C” shaped lines to represent the fingers. Use short lines to connect the fingers. Draw small “V” shapes at the tip of the fingers for the triangular claws.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other. Sketch too long curved lines to show the mouth and small blonde triangles for the teeth. Above the eyes and nose, draw curved lines.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

                      alt="draw the head and chest"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Draw his arm and waist</p>
<p>Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Draw his legs</p>
<p>Here, we shall portray Captain America in action. Use curved lines to show his extended right leg with boots. The left leg should appear more petite.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Draw his shield</p>
<p>Against his right arm, carefully draw a flattened circular shape. You can achieve this by drawing concentric circles with a large star in the middle. Draw his arm poking out from behind his shield.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other.
