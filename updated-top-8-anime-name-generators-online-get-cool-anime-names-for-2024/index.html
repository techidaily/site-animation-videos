These animation videos are incredibly effective in communicating complex ideas and boosting attention and retention for your audience. A custom whiteboard animation video is a do-it-yourself video that does not require a template, but you need to start from scratch. Here are top reasons why you need a custom whiteboard animation video to work:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="custom whiteboard animation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When you want to describe a complex, highly technical, or intricate idea, product, or system, a custom whiteboard animated video will help you out. The more detailed an explanation is, the harder it is to focus, and people often get bored during the description. Therefore, sharing a new business process with a custom whiteboard animation with your team is more manageable. Getting your point across will maintain our interest as long as the video is playing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A custom whiteboard animation saves you the stress of hiring actors to play in your video and turn, saves costs and serious embarrassment by actors.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Custom whiteboard animation videos are helpful when you want to use social media ads or YouTube for marketing as people like them, so, therefore, it is a good chance for you to get clicks, views, and more sales.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A custom whiteboard animation helps you to tell the story of your brand.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps to reuse old audio content lying around, for example, podcast episodes. You can create pre-existing audio with a custom whiteboard animation that will help you capitalize on content that has already been created and breathe in new life.</p>

<p> We all love GIFs and their impressive style of delivering stories. They not only contain set of frames rather they wrap inside lots of emotions and thoughts of creators. You can easily find numbers of eye catching GIF collections over social media sites.</p>
<p> If you love these animated images then probably you might have initiated a search over internet about how to create GIFs. And search engine must have shown you a path to unlimited <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GIF creator tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That’s common. But here we are going to talk about one professional recommendation for GIF creation. Yeah, it is Photoshop and it can instantly generate appealing animated Gifs for you.</p>
<p> Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-a-GIF-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-to-make-a-GIF-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How to make a GIF in Photoshop"></a>How to make a GIF in Photoshop</h2><ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop"></a>Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Launch-your-software"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-your-software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch your software"></a>Step 1: Launch your software</h4><p> Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported"><a href="#Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get your video clip imported"></a>Step 2: Get your video clip imported</h4><p> As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings"></a>Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.</p>
<p> It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:</p>
<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.</p>
<p><strong>Dither:</strong> The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.</p>
<p><strong>Lossy:</strong> If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file"><a href="#Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file"></a>Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file</h4><p> When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose “Save for Web” option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.</p>

<h3 id="Method-2-Make-a-GIF-from-Still-Photos-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Method-2-Make-a-GIF-from-Still-Photos-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop"></a>Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop</h3><p> It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop’s animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:</p>
<h4 id="1-Step-1"><a href="#1-Step-1" class="headerlink" title="1.  Step 1"></a>1.  Step 1</h4><p> First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts. It will provide you an option for Load Files into Stack. Now hit browse button and choose your images from desktop folder that you further want to use for development of GIF image. Hit OK. It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.</p>
<p> Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.</p>
<p> All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File &gt; New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.</p>
<p> Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have “Load Files into Stack” feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Step-2"><a href="#2-Step-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Step 2"></a>2.  Step 2</h4><p> Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.</p>
<p> As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose “Make Frames from Layer” option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.</p>
<h4 id="3-Step-3"><a href="#3-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Step 3"></a>3.  Step 3</h4><p> Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.</p>

<p> If you love these animated images then probably you might have initiated a search over internet about how to create GIFs. And search engine must have shown you a path to unlimited <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GIF creator tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That’s common. But here we are going to talk about one professional recommendation for GIF creation. Yeah, it is Photoshop and it can instantly generate appealing animated Gifs for you.</p>
<p> Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-a-GIF-in-Photoshop-2"><a href="#How-to-make-a-GIF-in-Photoshop-2" class="headerlink" title="How to make a GIF in Photoshop"></a>How to make a GIF in Photoshop</h2><ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop-2"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop"></a>Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Launch-your-software-2"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-your-software-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch your software"></a>Step 1: Launch your software</h4><p> Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported-2"><a href="#Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get your video clip imported"></a>Step 2: Get your video clip imported</h4><p> As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings-2"><a href="#Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings"></a>Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.</p>
<p> It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:</p>
<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.</p>
<p><strong>Dither:</strong> The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.</p>
<p><strong>Lossy:</strong> If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file-2"><a href="#Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file"></a>Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file</h4><p> When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose “Save for Web” option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.</p>

<p> Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.</p>
<p> All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File &gt; New option to start working with a new project.

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-20"><a href="#In-this-article-20" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?](#Part 1)</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>
<p><img

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>
<p><img

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX"><a href="#05IKMAX" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-1"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-1"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-1"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-1" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro-1"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-1"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-1" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-1"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-1" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>

We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-3"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-3"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-3"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-3" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro-3"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-3"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-3" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-3"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-3" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX-3"><a href="#05IKMAX-3" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-15"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-15" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in introducing animations into your content but you don’t have the time or the patience to get too involved with <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>As with learning any profession, to become a professional Adobe 3D animation expert isn’t something generally fulfilled in just a few weeks, months, or even years. Instead, it’s a career path that takes a great deal of dedication and love to the art form, but it will be entirely worth considering if you wish it.</p>
<p>This article will explain how to proceed with <strong>Adobe 3D animation</strong> and the supportive steps to get you there successfully.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Does-Adobe-Have-3D-Animation-Software"><a href="#Part-1-Does-Adobe-Have-3D-Animation-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Does Adobe Have 3D Animation Software?"></a>Part 1 Does Adobe Have 3D Animation Software?</h2><p>You’ll be able to create a range of animation styles using After Effects CC once you grasp the basic concepts. This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.</p>
<p>Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
<p>This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although <strong>Adobe 3D animation</strong> can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.</p>
<p>This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.</p>
<p>It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.</p>
<h3 id="01How-is-After-Effects-used"><a href="#01How-is-After-Effects-used" class="headerlink" title="01How is After Effects used?"></a>01How is After Effects used?</h3><p>The primary uses of After Effects categorize into three sections:</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Animation</strong>, and</p>
<p><strong>Compositing.</strong></p>
<p>The kind of animation for which After Effects is widely used is Motion Graphics, which includes making the motion of traditionally static objects such as text, logos, and other graphic elements.</p>
<p>Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.</p>
<p>It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.</p>
<h3 id="02Who-uses-After-Effects"><a href="#02Who-uses-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="02Who uses After Effects?"></a>02Who uses After Effects?</h3><p>The After Effects is valuable to animators, visual artists, advertising agencies, video editors, video artists, video producers, social media professionals, motion graphics designers, UX professionals, etc. Gaining proficiency in After Effects comes in-depth from training, tutorials, and other hands-on use courses.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-5-Video-After-Effects-Templates-for-2022-Inspiration"><a href="#Part-2-5-Video-After-Effects-Templates-for-2022-Inspiration" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 5 Video After Effects Templates for 2022 Inspiration"></a>Part 2 5 Video After Effects Templates for 2022 Inspiration</h2><p>It’s a great time to promote your business, craft an excellent video presentation, or showcase your product launch.

This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.</p>
<p>Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
<p>This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although <strong>Adobe 3D animation</strong> can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.</p>
<p>This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.</p>
<p>It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.</p>
<h3 id="01How-is-After-Effects-used-3"><a href="#01How-is-After-Effects-used-3" class="headerlink" title="01How is After Effects used?"></a>01How is After Effects used?</h3><p>The primary uses of After Effects categorize into three sections:</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Animation</strong>, and</p>
<p><strong>Compositing.</strong></p>
<p>The kind of animation for which After Effects is widely used is Motion Graphics, which includes making the motion of traditionally static objects such as text, logos, and other graphic elements.</p>
<p>Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.</p>
<p>It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.</p>

<p>Now, let’s add some music to the video. So, go to the Audio tab and select any one of the options among them. There are different choices for you to explore here as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-video-1.jpg"
                      alt="add audio canva"
                ></p>
<p>After you’re done, you can hit the Preview Play button on the top and see your project, as shown below.</p>
<p>It’s all done, and you can proceed with the next section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-Canva-animated-video-with-your-video-3"><a href="#Part-2-Create-Canva-animated-video-with-your-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Create Canva animated video with your video"></a>Part 2 Create Canva animated video with your video</h2><p>We’ll discuss how to create an animated video by uploading our video in Canva without using any template in this section. After logging in to the Canva account credentials, select the Video tab and choose the different templates offered.</p>
<p>We’ve selected a blank template for the purpose as follows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-video-9.jpg"
                      alt="select blank template"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to head directly towards the Uploads tab and upload your video created over here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-video-5.jpg"
                      alt="canva uploads"
                ></p>
<p>By now, you have most probably got over with uploading your media. Click the uploaded video, and it will automatically enter within the editing panel of Canva, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-video-4.jpg"
                      alt="canva uploaded video”"
                ></p>
<p>You’re all done now, and it’s all finished! Even though template usage is quite simple, it’s pretty straightforward when you don’t use any ready-made template. However, you can still beautify this simple video with different elements like text, music, etc.</p>
<p>Animation style videos influence people of all ages to whatever generation, or the kind you belong to will be one of them for sure.</p>
<p>Animated ones provoke diverse impacts instead of ordinary videos on the audience utilizing illustration, kinesthetic, etc. But the fact is, due to technological advancements and overexposure to social media sites, we have forgotten its significance.</p>
<p>Want to know some other most accessible software tools that can bring out the artist in you? Here is an alternative that is all you need.</p>
