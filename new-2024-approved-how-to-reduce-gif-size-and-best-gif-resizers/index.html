It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.</p>
<p> <strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.</p>

These files use to have small size so they can be transferred and downloaded with ease and at faster rate. If you are interested to know about various resizing concepts related to GIFs then the article below can be helpful for you.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-reduce-GIF-size-1"><a href="#How-to-reduce-GIF-size-1" class="headerlink" title="How to reduce GIF size?"></a>How to reduce GIF size?</h2><p>There are so many things that contribute in managing overall size of GIFs. The list includes the colour count inside, dimensions of images that you have used for development of GIFs and number of frames included inside one GIF folder. In case if it is an animated GIF then size may increase accordingly. Somehow, if you become able to optimize your Gifs then it is much easier to share them over internet.</p>
<p>Photoshop is a great tool to edit your image, including gif images. Here we are going to show you how to make your GIF smaller in Photoshop.</p>

                ></p>

<p>The very first task for users is to bring your GIF video file onto Photoshop timeline. Sometimes, it is not essential to update whole series of your GIF animation to the library, the GIF can be simply trimmed at timeline panel. One needs to turn on loop option and then be active enough to allocate the right place to trim your video.</p>
<p> <strong>2. Reduce dimensions of Output:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Those who are working on Photoshop CC 2017 version will be able to develop GIFs by simply executing Explore As option from menu. To do this, they need to move to files and then from drop down menu select Export as. Soon a menu will open where you need to choose your output file format as GIF and adjust weight and height parameter to reduce physical dimensions of your image.</p>
<p>In case if you are using Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 then on its interface, users need to move to File and then hit Save for Web option. It will help to open a Save for Web type dialogue box immediately, on this new window you can apply desired changes to physical dimensions of your content, reduce color information and apply dithering etc.</p>
<p> <strong>3. Adjust number of colors in image:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-number-photoshop.jpg"
                     
                ></p>

<p>One of the most useful tricks for marketers is to optimize size of their GIF images by adjusting total number of colours to it. It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.</p>
<p> <strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can also reduce number of frames in their GIFs.</li>
<li>Never forget to avoid dithering as it may help to improve appearance of images.</li>
<li>It is essential work with loss less compression algorithms otherwise huge loss in information will be carried out.</li>
<li>Interlacing is not good option for your GIFs as it causes significant increase in overall file size.</li>

<p>Anime is an elaborate form of animation with its bright colors and vivid imagination. It is a modified version of animation as we know it in the West with a peculiar Japanese taste of art. Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.</p>
<p>Now, who is the <strong>coolest anime character</strong> in the history of anime, and what are <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 popular cartoon characters that you won’t want to miss <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the <strong>best anime characters</strong> in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-Coolest-Anime-Characters-Ever"><a href="#Top-10-Coolest-Anime-Characters-Ever" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever"></a>Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever</h2><ul>

<li><a href="#part9">9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)</a></li>
<li><a href="#part10">10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Light-Yagami-Death-Note"><a href="#1-Light-Yagami-Death-Note" class="headerlink" title="1. Light Yagami (Death Note)"></a>1. Light Yagami (Death Note)</h3><p>Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.</p>
<p>The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.</p>
<h3 id="2-Itachi-Uchiha-Naruto"><a href="#2-Itachi-Uchiha-Naruto" class="headerlink" title="2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)"></a>2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)</h3><p>Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.</p>
<h3 id="3-Naruto-Uzumaki-Naruto"><a href="#3-Naruto-Uzumaki-Naruto" class="headerlink" title="3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)"></a>3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)</h3><p>The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.</p>
<p>Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.</p>
<h3 id="4-Spike-Spiegel-Cowboy-Bebop"><a href="#4-Spike-Spiegel-Cowboy-Bebop" class="headerlink" title="4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)"></a>4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)</h3><p>Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.</p>
<p>Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.</p>
<h3 id="5-Levi-Attack-on-Titan"><a href="#5-Levi-Attack-on-Titan" class="headerlink" title="5. Levi (Attack on Titan)"></a>5. Levi (Attack on Titan)</h3><p>A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.</p>
<p>His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.</p>
<h3 id="6-Saitama-One-Punch-Man"><a href="#6-Saitama-One-Punch-Man" class="headerlink" title="6. Saitama (One Punch Man)"></a>6. Saitama (One Punch Man)</h3><p>Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.</p>
<h3 id="7-Portagas-D-Ace-One-Piece"><a href="#7-Portagas-D-Ace-One-Piece" class="headerlink" title="7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)"></a>7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)</h3><p>Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.</p>
<h3 id="8-Meliodas-The-Seven-Deadly-Sins"><a href="#8-Meliodas-The-Seven-Deadly-Sins" class="headerlink" title="8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)"></a>8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)</h3><p>Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.</p>
<p>The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.</p>
<h3 id="9-Shoto-Todoroki-My-Hero-Academia"><a href="#9-Shoto-Todoroki-My-Hero-Academia" class="headerlink" title="9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)"></a>9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)</h3><p>Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.</p>
<p>Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.</p>
<h3 id="10-Killua-Zaoldyeck-Hunter-X-Hunter"><a href="#10-Killua-Zaoldyeck-Hunter-X-Hunter" class="headerlink" title="10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)"></a>10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)</h3><p>Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.</p>
<p>Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.</p>

<p>Anime is an elaborate form of animation with its bright colors and vivid imagination. It is a modified version of animation as we know it in the West with a peculiar Japanese taste of art. Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.</p>
<p>Now, who is the <strong>coolest anime character</strong> in the history of anime, and what are <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 popular cartoon characters that you won’t want to miss <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the <strong>best anime characters</strong> in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-Coolest-Anime-Characters-Ever-1"><a href="#Top-10-Coolest-Anime-Characters-Ever-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever"></a>Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever</h2><ul>

<li><a href="#part10">10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Light-Yagami-Death-Note-1"><a href="#1-Light-Yagami-Death-Note-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Light Yagami (Death Note)"></a>1. Light Yagami (Death Note)</h3><p>Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.</p>
<p>The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.</p>
<h3 id="2-Itachi-Uchiha-Naruto-1"><a href="#2-Itachi-Uchiha-Naruto-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)"></a>2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)</h3><p>Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.</p>
<h3 id="3-Naruto-Uzumaki-Naruto-1"><a href="#3-Naruto-Uzumaki-Naruto-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)"></a>3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)</h3><p>The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.</p>
<p>Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.</p>
<h3 id="4-Spike-Spiegel-Cowboy-Bebop-1"><a href="#4-Spike-Spiegel-Cowboy-Bebop-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)"></a>4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)</h3><p>Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.</p>
<p>Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.</p>
<h3 id="5-Levi-Attack-on-Titan-1"><a href="#5-Levi-Attack-on-Titan-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Levi (Attack on Titan)"></a>5. Levi (Attack on Titan)</h3><p>A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.</p>
<p>His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.</p>
<h3 id="6-Saitama-One-Punch-Man-1"><a href="#6-Saitama-One-Punch-Man-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Saitama (One Punch Man)"></a>6. Saitama (One Punch Man)</h3><p>Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.</p>
<h3 id="7-Portagas-D-Ace-One-Piece-1"><a href="#7-Portagas-D-Ace-One-Piece-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)"></a>7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)</h3><p>Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.</p>
<h3 id="8-Meliodas-The-Seven-Deadly-Sins-1"><a href="#8-Meliodas-The-Seven-Deadly-Sins-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)"></a>8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)</h3><p>Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.</p>
<p>The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.</p>
<h3 id="9-Shoto-Todoroki-My-Hero-Academia-1"><a href="#9-Shoto-Todoroki-My-Hero-Academia-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)"></a>9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)</h3><p>Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.</p>
<p>Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.</p>
<h3 id="10-Killua-Zaoldyeck-Hunter-X-Hunter-1"><a href="#10-Killua-Zaoldyeck-Hunter-X-Hunter-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)"></a>10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)</h3><p>Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life.

He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.</p>

<p>Anime is an elaborate form of animation with its bright colors and vivid imagination. It is a modified version of animation as we know it in the West with a peculiar Japanese taste of art. Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.</p>
<p>Now, who is the <strong>coolest anime character</strong> in the history of anime, and what are <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >10 popular cartoon characters that you won’t want to miss <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the <strong>best anime characters</strong> in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.</p>
<h2 id="Top-10-Coolest-Anime-Characters-Ever-3"><a href="#Top-10-Coolest-Anime-Characters-Ever-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever"></a>Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever</h2><ul>
<li><a href="#part1">1. Light Yagami (Death Note)</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)</a></li>
<li><a href="#part3">3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)</a></li>

<li><a href="#part9">9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)</a></li>
<li><a href="#part10">10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Light-Yagami-Death-Note-3"><a href="#1-Light-Yagami-Death-Note-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Light Yagami (Death Note)"></a>1. Light Yagami (Death Note)</h3><p>Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.</p>
<p>The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.</p>
<h3 id="2-Itachi-Uchiha-Naruto-3"><a href="#2-Itachi-Uchiha-Naruto-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)"></a>2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)</h3><p>Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.</p>
<h3 id="3-Naruto-Uzumaki-Naruto-3"><a href="#3-Naruto-Uzumaki-Naruto-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)"></a>3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)</h3><p>The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.</p>
<p>Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.</p>
<h3 id="4-Spike-Spiegel-Cowboy-Bebop-3"><a href="#4-Spike-Spiegel-Cowboy-Bebop-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)"></a>4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)</h3><p>Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.</p>
<p>Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.</p>
<h3 id="5-Levi-Attack-on-Titan-3"><a href="#5-Levi-Attack-on-Titan-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Levi (Attack on Titan)"></a>5. Levi (Attack on Titan)</h3><p>A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.</p>
<p>His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.</p>
<h3 id="6-Saitama-One-Punch-Man-3"><a href="#6-Saitama-One-Punch-Man-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Saitama (One Punch Man)"></a>6. Saitama (One Punch Man)</h3><p>Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.</p>
<h3 id="7-Portagas-D-Ace-One-Piece-3"><a href="#7-Portagas-D-Ace-One-Piece-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)"></a>7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)</h3><p>Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.</p>
<h3 id="8-Meliodas-The-Seven-Deadly-Sins-3"><a href="#8-Meliodas-The-Seven-Deadly-Sins-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)"></a>8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)</h3><p>Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.</p>
<p>The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.</p>
<h3 id="9-Shoto-Todoroki-My-Hero-Academia-3"><a href="#9-Shoto-Todoroki-My-Hero-Academia-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)"></a>9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)</h3><p>Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.</p>
<p>Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.</p>
<h3 id="10-Killua-Zaoldyeck-Hunter-X-Hunter-3"><a href="#10-Killua-Zaoldyeck-Hunter-X-Hunter-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)"></a>10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)</h3><p>Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.</p>
<p>Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-Adobe-Animate-CC"><a href="#What-is-Adobe-Animate-CC" class="headerlink" title="What is Adobe Animate CC?"></a>What is Adobe Animate CC?</h2><p>The animation lovers when seeking to serve the purpose, must have used and heard about Adobe Flash, but now we would here inform you that Adobe Animate CC has now replaced the old Adobe Flash.</p>
<p>Along with renaming the tool, the evolution from Flash to Adobe Animate CC has added a wide range of advanced functionalities like support to WebGL and HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p>You will not regret your decision after reading this article and will find that using Adobe Animate CC is a wise choice. Hence, let’s begin to get enlightened on the features.</p>
<h2 id="New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC"><a href="#New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC" class="headerlink" title="New features of Adobe Animate CC"></a>New features of Adobe Animate CC</h2><h4 id="1-Adobe-Animate-Camera"><a href="#1-Adobe-Animate-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1. Adobe Animate Camera"></a>1. Adobe Animate Camera</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC introduces virtual camera functionality unlike other <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of this feature, you can easily stimulate your camera’s movement giving your animation a more realistic view.</p>
<p>Making it simpler, you can effortlessly execute panning, zooming and rotating to your animations if you wish. Using the virtual camera in Animate CC, you will be enabling to add more dramatic effects while creating an animation.</p>
<p>For instance, if there’s a fighting scene in our animated movie, you can rotate at the moment the scene shows destruction to give it a dramatic effect or you can zoom in or out and change the viewer’s attention from one point to the other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-camera.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc camera"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Export-format"><a href="#2-Export-format" class="headerlink" title="2. Export format"></a>2. Export format</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC has adapted the web standards for the exporting your animation which makes it easier for everyone to view it from desktop to mobile device.</p>
<p>This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.</p>
<p>Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-export-format.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc export format"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Vector-brushes"><a href="#3-Vector-brushes" class="headerlink" title="3. Vector brushes"></a>3. Vector brushes</h4><p>Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.</p>
<p>This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-vector-brush.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc vector brush"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Audio-Syncing"><a href="#4-Audio-Syncing" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Syncing"></a>4. Audio Syncing</h4><p>The timeline feature of the tool will now allow the users to sync audios in their animations and this is a yet another feature that Animate CC has added. This means you can do audio synchronization for your animation series.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-audio-syncing.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc audio syncing"
                ></p>
<p>Nevertheless, doing this can be a little demanding as well as time-consuming with HTML5 alone. In addition, you also get enabled for audio loop control with the Adobe Animate CC’s timeline feature.</p>
<h4 id="5-Font"><a href="#5-Font" class="headerlink" title="5. Font"></a>5. Font</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts. These web fonts will be present for HTML5 canvas documents in the tool. Users can pick out from thousands of high-quality fonts via a subscription plan.</p>
<p>Putting in different words, first you can try some selected fonts available in the Typekit library via any level of Creative Cloud plan. Then when you subscribe by spending some money, you can then get access to complete Typekit library where there are thousands of premium fonts for HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-font.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc font"
                ></p>

<p>Along with renaming the tool, the evolution from Flash to Adobe Animate CC has added a wide range of advanced functionalities like support to WebGL and HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p>You will not regret your decision after reading this article and will find that using Adobe Animate CC is a wise choice. Hence, let’s begin to get enlightened on the features.</p>
<h2 id="New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC-1"><a href="#New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC-1" class="headerlink" title="New features of Adobe Animate CC"></a>New features of Adobe Animate CC</h2><h4 id="1-Adobe-Animate-Camera-1"><a href="#1-Adobe-Animate-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Adobe Animate Camera"></a>1. Adobe Animate Camera</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC introduces virtual camera functionality unlike other <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of this feature, you can easily stimulate your camera’s movement giving your animation a more realistic view.</p>
<p>Making it simpler, you can effortlessly execute panning, zooming and rotating to your animations if you wish. Using the virtual camera in Animate CC, you will be enabling to add more dramatic effects while creating an animation.</p>
<p>For instance, if there’s a fighting scene in our animated movie, you can rotate at the moment the scene shows destruction to give it a dramatic effect or you can zoom in or out and change the viewer’s attention from one point to the other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-camera.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc camera"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Export-format-1"><a href="#2-Export-format-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Export format"></a>2. Export format</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC has adapted the web standards for the exporting your animation which makes it easier for everyone to view it from desktop to mobile device.</p>
<p>This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.</p>
<p>Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animate cc export format"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Vector-brushes-1"><a href="#3-Vector-brushes-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Vector brushes"></a>3. Vector brushes</h4><p>Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.</p>
<p>This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Audio-Syncing-1"><a href="#4-Audio-Syncing-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Syncing"></a>4. Audio Syncing</h4><p>The timeline feature of the tool will now allow the users to sync audios in their animations and this is a yet another feature that Animate CC has added. This means you can do audio synchronization for your animation series.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animate cc audio syncing"
                ></p>
<p>Nevertheless, doing this can be a little demanding as well as time-consuming with HTML5 alone. In addition, you also get enabled for audio loop control with the Adobe Animate CC’s timeline feature.</p>
<h4 id="5-Font-1"><a href="#5-Font-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Font"></a>5. Font</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts. These web fonts will be present for HTML5 canvas documents in the tool. Users can pick out from thousands of high-quality fonts via a subscription plan.</p>
<p>Putting in different words, first you can try some selected fonts available in the Typekit library via any level of Creative Cloud plan. Then when you subscribe by spending some money, you can then get access to complete Typekit library where there are thousands of premium fonts for HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p><img

<p>No, this is a not another feature, but an interesting yet powerful video editing software created by Wondershare, one of the leading brand in multimedia field. You can use this tool and get your animated videos edited using its extraordinary effects.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-6-Animated-PowerPoint-Templates-with-Interactive-Features"><a href="#Part-1-6-Animated-PowerPoint-Templates-with-Interactive-Features" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features"></a>Part 1 <strong>6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features</strong></h2><p>The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>
<h3 id="01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template"><a href="#01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template" class="headerlink" title="01Company Presentation PowerPoint Template"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm_campaign=elements_af_493214&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius&mp=Theme%20Junkie"><strong>Company Presentation PowerPoint Template</strong></a></h3><p>For the first of the <strong>Moving Animation PowerPoint</strong> templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Open Project.</strong></h3><p>First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Animation"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2. Add Animation."></a>02<strong>Step 2. Add Animation.</strong></h3><p>Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="03Step-3-Choose-Animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Choose-Animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Choose Animation."></a>03<strong>Step 3. Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="04Step-4-Choose-Motion-Path-Animation"><a href="#04Step-4-Choose-Motion-Path-Animation" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4. Choose Motion Path Animation"></a>04<strong>Step 4. Choose Motion Path Animation</strong></h3><p>In order to make <strong>motion animation in PowerPoint</strong>, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.</p>
<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h3 id="05Step-5-Adjust-Animation"><a href="#05Step-5-Adjust-Animation" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5. Adjust Animation."></a>05<strong>Step 5. Adjust Animation.</strong></h3><p>With <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions"><a href="#01Transitions" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations"><a href="#02Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start"><a href="#03Animation-Start" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png"
                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png"
                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay"><a href="#05Animation-Delay" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Delay"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Separate into Sections with Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>

Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish.

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>

It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1.

Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>

Choose Motion Path Animation</strong></h3><p>In order to make <strong>motion animation in PowerPoint</strong>, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.</p>
<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-1"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-1"><a href="#01Transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-1"><a href="#02Animations-1" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-1"><a href="#03Animation-Start-1" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-1"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-1"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-1" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>

                     lazyload

<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-1"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-1" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-1"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-1" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-1"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-1" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>

<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-1"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-1" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-1"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-1" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>

It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1.

Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>

<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-2"><a href="#01Transitions-2" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-2"><a href="#02Animations-2" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-2"><a href="#03Animation-Start-2" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-2"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-2" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>

<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-2"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-2" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>

<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-2"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-2" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-2"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-2" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-2"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-2" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>

<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-2"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-2" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>

It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-3"><a href="#01Transitions-3" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-3"><a href="#02Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>

<h3 id="03Animation-Start-3"><a href="#03Animation-Start-3" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>

<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-3"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-3" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>

<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-3"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-3" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>

<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-3"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-3" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-3"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-3" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-3"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-3" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-3"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-3" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-3"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-3" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

In the following section of this article, let us keep our focus on learning about some of the most amazing tips and tricks to upgrade your Insta story slideshow to the next level:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>A Compact Photo Album</strong></p>
<p>Do you land among those social media freaks how want to share just every moment of your day with your peers, or are you confused on selecting the best photos and videos of a cherished event, vacation or bringing home a new utility and end up posting a heap of media on your social media handles?</p>

You can use the feature to create a collection of amazing videos as well and share it too with your friends on social media without the guilt of becoming a feed-hog.</p>
<p>Want a practical experience of using Instagram slideshows? See through the following tutorial to understand the exact creation process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Choose the First Image</strong></p>
<p>Begin with selecting the first image for your slideshow, just as you would ideally do for a normal, single image Instagram feed and long press the same.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Confirming the Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the bottom right corner of your selected image to locate a button similar to a photo slideshow. Tap the button to see a ‘1’ inscribed in a blue circle appear on your chosen image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Make Further Selections</strong></p>
<p>You can now proceed to select other images or videos for the slideshow, in a similar fashion as the first one. You are allowed to include a maximum of 10 media files within the slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>Tap the ‘Next’ button when you have finished making the required selections. The editor interface will now open to let you customize the selected images with a series of effects and filters, both one at a time, as well as the entire set altogether.

<p><strong>Step 5: The Final Touches</strong></p>
<p>Once you are done with the editing process, continue to follow the remaining steps, as you would do to create a normal Instagram post. You can include captions, locations and tag your peers on the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Time to Share!</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animated Text Overlays</strong></p>
<p>If your Instagram story slideshows are missing out on the visual spunk, try complimenting their images and videos with animated transitions and text overlays. Short and quick animations are the best ways to enhance a slideshow story with an eye catching effect. Applying a variety of text overlays would help to keep the audience curious about the next visual delight.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer a Vertical Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
