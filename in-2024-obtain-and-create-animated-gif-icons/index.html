<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop video repeat"
                ></p>

                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>

While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>

                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to include the image zoom and camera pan features within your project by clicking on the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option. You can further, modify the preset durations of transitions, effects and photos in the ‘Editing’ tab itself before adding them to the editor timeline.

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>

Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Overlays and Filters for an Improvised Colour Scheme</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

                ></p>

<p>Once you have selected all the music tracks, place them one by one on the project timeline and move ahead with adjusting their play durations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Export Your Creation</strong></p>

All you need to do is, navigate to and tap the ‘Export’ button in the top right corner of the editor screen and proceed to set the resolution and frame rate, and select the output file format of your created slideshow in the ‘Export Window’ that appears.</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 07"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 12"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
