<p>Ever since the debut of Charles M. Schulz’s comic strip in 1950, Charlie Brown has been a mainstay of children’s television. His adventures have been featured in several movies and television specials, and they have been published in books and comic strips. He is an iconic character that children have loved for over six decades.</p>

<h3 id="02George-of-the-Jungle"><a href="#02George-of-the-Jungle" class="headerlink" title="02George of the Jungle"></a>02George of the Jungle</h3><p>George was based on Tarzan, but there were a few differences. For example, George was really quite stupid. When he left home, he sometimes forgot that he resided in a tree house. One time, when swinging on vines, he crashed into trees because they felt solid under his arms.</p>

<h3 id="03Bart-Simpson"><a href="#03Bart-Simpson" class="headerlink" title="03Bart Simpson"></a>03Bart Simpson</h3><p>The first born of Homer and Marge is a troublemaking, mischievous, cheeky brat who lives to torment his father. This story follows the life of the first born son of Homer and Marge, Bart Simpson. Bart is ten years old in this story, but he’s full of mischief.</p>
<p>The very first episode of The Simpsons, “Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,” was broadcast on August 13, 1990. In that episode, Bart starts out as a mischievous and rebellious child. As the show progressed into the 90s, Bart’s catchphrases became well-known amongst children and adults alike and were often used in conversations. He is one of the most iconic cartoon characters ever created, having won many awards for his work, and he stars in a show that doesn’t seem to be losing any popularity.</p>

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

                      alt="Cartoon Lens on Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

                ></p>
<p>Again, we’re moving towards a different kind of animation style with this next filter from Snapchat, but the Comics Style filter does have its own promises of fun as well Especially for those who are long-time fans of American comics (or, even, your average modern-day Avengers fan)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-4"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-4" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-1"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg"
                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-12"><a href="#Pros-12" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-12"><a href="#Cons-12" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-13"><a href="#Pros-13" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-13"><a href="#Cons-13" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-14"><a href="#Pros-14" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>

<h5 id="Cons-14"><a href="#Cons-14" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-2"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-24"><a href="#Pros-24" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-24"><a href="#Cons-24" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-25"><a href="#Pros-25" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-25"><a href="#Cons-25" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-26"><a href="#Pros-26" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-26"><a href="#Cons-26" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-6"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-6" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>

                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-36"><a href="#Pros-36" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>

<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-38"><a href="#Pros-38" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>

<h5 id="Cons-38"><a href="#Cons-38" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list.

                      alt="Cartoon Lens on Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

<p><strong>Anime Filter #9: Comics Style</strong></p>

                      alt="Comics Style Lens from Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>Again, we’re moving towards a different kind of animation style with this next filter from Snapchat, but the Comics Style filter does have its own promises of fun as well Especially for those who are long-time fans of American comics (or, even, your average modern-day Avengers fan)</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, this might get confusing, but for our last picks, we actually have a set of filters all called <strong>Cartoon 3D Style</strong> But trust us They’re all different This first version is one you would probably relate more to the DreamWorks motion picture, Ratatouille</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-7"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-7" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

<p>When we talk about motion, it makes us think about moves, but it refers to step motion when speaking about still-motion. So, in simple words, <strong>still motion animation</strong> refers to the animation that holds picture-to-picture motion animation.</p>
<p>This article covers all the relevant information related to <strong>still motion animation</strong>, paper motion animation, liquid motion animation. The name may vary, but such motions come under stop motion or <strong>still motion</strong> techniques to a great extent. That uses picture after picture or stopping camera process from reflecting animation to any inanimate objects or things. Under paper motion animation, images are adjusted in such a manner that results in continual animation reflection.</p>

<p><strong>Still motion animation</strong> is also known as <strong>walking motion animation and stalk motion animation</strong> used to boost a scene in animation. It comes in a frame-to-frame outlook. It can be a booster in horror movies, comedy, and thrillers. It used to express flashbacks, dreams, and summaries of a long scene. Sometimes it could be slower, faster, fade, blur or split frames to discover&#x2F;show unconscious scenes.</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first.

Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more. Be warned, it’s not the kind of project you should go into if you’re not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Still, there’s something satisfying about a well-done <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1.

Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first.

Before the 2016 classic, we first meet Dory in the 2003 Pixar’s classic ‘finding Nemo’ where Dory helps Marlin, a clownfish, reunites with his son, Nemo. In ‘Finding Dory, ‘ young Dory’s amnesiac was finally brought back thirteen years later. Dory is perseverant, has a trim physique, and yet she can do whatever she has set her mind to do.</p>

He happens to be Moana’s best friend. Pua made his first appearance during the ‘Where you are’ performance alongside the village chief’s daughter. On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>

Dory was voiced by the seven-year-old daughter of producer Lindsey Collins. Dory saw her short-term memory loss as a form of weakness. Her parents assured her that it was okay but warned her to stay away from the undertow. Before the 2016 classic, we first meet Dory in the 2003 Pixar’s classic ‘finding Nemo’ where Dory helps Marlin, a clownfish, reunites with his son, Nemo. In ‘Finding Dory, ‘ young Dory’s amnesiac was finally brought back thirteen years later. Dory is perseverant, has a trim physique, and yet she can do whatever she has set her mind to do.</p>

He happens to be Moana’s best friend. Pua made his first appearance during the ‘Where you are’ performance alongside the village chief’s daughter. On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>

Even though Lilo’s classmates all see Stitch as unattractive and captain Gantu does not like him, Lilo makes away with societal beauty standards, and views Stitch as cute and fluffy.</p>
