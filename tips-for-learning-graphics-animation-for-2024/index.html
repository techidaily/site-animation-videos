<p>In the recent few years, videos have become the primary tool for marketers to attract their target customers. Unlike banners and pamphlets, videos are relatively more engaging and make it easier for marketers to establish a connection with the viewers. Now, each brand has different preferences when it comes to choosing the right video marketing strategy.</p>
<p>While some brands opt for conventional video advertisements, others get a bit creative and introduce <strong>graphics animation</strong> to their videos to make them more captivating. Of course, if you want to maximize the user’s attention and retain more customers, you would prefer the latter. Animated videos are more engaging and also sets the brand apart from the rest of the crowd.</p>

The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.</p>
<p>However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why <strong>graphics and animations</strong> should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.</p>
<p>Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Motion-Graphics-and-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Motion-Graphics-and-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What’s the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?"></a>Part 2 What’s the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?</h2><p>Now, whenever we talk about <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.</p>
<h3 id="01Motion-Graphics"><a href="#01Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="01Motion Graphics"></a>01Motion Graphics</h3><p><img

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.</p>
<h3 id="02Animations"><a href="#02Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02Animations</h3><p>Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of <strong>graphics animations.</strong> However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text&#x2F;objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.</p>
<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Graphic-Design-Techniques-for-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#Part-3-5-Graphic-Design-Techniques-for-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics"></a>Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics</h2><p>So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="01Start-With-a-Template"><a href="#01Start-With-a-Template" class="headerlink" title="01Start With a Template"></a>01Start With a Template</h3><p>Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.</p>
<p>Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.</p>

                      alt="graphic design template"

<h3 id="02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding"><a href="#02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="02Be Subtle With Personal Branding"></a>02Be Subtle With Personal Branding</h3><p>Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your <strong>motion graphics animation.</strong></p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Do-Not-Add-Unnecessary-Elements"><a href="#03Do-Not-Add-Unnecessary-Elements" class="headerlink" title="03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements"></a>03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements</h3><p>It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="unnecessary element"

<h3 id="04Design-Multiple-Variations"><a href="#04Design-Multiple-Variations" class="headerlink" title="04Design Multiple Variations"></a>04Design Multiple Variations</h3><p>It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A&#x2F;B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.</p>
<h3 id="05Use-GIF-Format"><a href="#05Use-GIF-Format" class="headerlink" title="05Use GIF Format"></a>05Use GIF Format</h3><p>Finally, once your <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.</p>

As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of <strong>graphics animations.</strong> However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text&#x2F;objects.

<p>However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why <strong>graphics and animations</strong> should be a part of your marketing strategy.

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.</p>

While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.</p>

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.</p>
<h3 id="02Animations-3"><a href="#02Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02Animations</h3><p>Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of <strong>graphics animations.</strong> However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text&#x2F;objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.</p>
<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.</p>

Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="01Start-With-a-Template-3"><a href="#01Start-With-a-Template-3" class="headerlink" title="01Start With a Template"></a>01Start With a Template</h3><p>Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.</p>
<p>Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.</p>

<h3 id="02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding-3"><a href="#02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding-3" class="headerlink" title="02Be Subtle With Personal Branding"></a>02Be Subtle With Personal Branding</h3><p>Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your <strong>motion graphics animation.</strong></p>

Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.</p>

That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A&#x2F;B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps"><a href="#Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps"></a>Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps</h2><p>We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.</p>
<p>Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.</p>
<h3 id="1-GIPHY"><a href="#1-GIPHY" class="headerlink" title="1. GIPHY"></a>1. GIPHY</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg"
                      alt="giphy"
                ></p>
<p>The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.</p>
<p>Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.</p>
<p>It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.</p>
<h3 id="2-Motionleap"><a href="#2-Motionleap" class="headerlink" title="2. Motionleap"></a>2. Motionleap</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg"
                      alt="motionleap"
                ></p>
<p>Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there’s a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn’t put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.</p>
<p>The app’s primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.</p>
<p>You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.</p>
<p>Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you’ve paid for a Pro account.</p>
<h3 id="3-Movepic"><a href="#3-Movepic" class="headerlink" title="3. Movepic"></a>3. Movepic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg"
                      alt="movepic"
                ></p>
<p>Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that you wouldn’t be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.</p>
<h3 id="4-ImgPlay"><a href="#4-ImgPlay" class="headerlink" title="4. ImgPlay"></a>4. ImgPlay</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg"
                      alt="imgplay"
                ></p>
<p>ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can’t remove unless you update to a complete account.</p>
<p>The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.</p>
<h3 id="5-Zoetropic"><a href="#5-Zoetropic" class="headerlink" title="5. Zoetropic"></a>5. Zoetropic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg"
                      alt="zoetropic"
                ></p>
<p>If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren’t as extensive as other apps we’ve mentioned, it does the job pretty well.</p>
<p>To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.</p>
<p>On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you’re considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.</p>
<h3 id="6-StoryZ"><a href="#6-StoryZ" class="headerlink" title="6. StoryZ"></a>6. StoryZ</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg"
                      alt="storyz"
                ></p>
<p>Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.</p>
<p>One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.</p>
<h3 id="7-Lumyer"><a href="#7-Lumyer" class="headerlink" title="7. Lumyer"></a>7. Lumyer</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg"
                      alt="lumyer"
                ></p>

<p>A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they’re ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps-1"><a href="#Part-1-Top-10-Animated-Photo-Collage-Apps-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps"></a>Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps</h2><p>We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.</p>
<p>Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.</p>
<h3 id="1-GIPHY-1"><a href="#1-GIPHY-1" class="headerlink" title="1. GIPHY"></a>1. GIPHY</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg"
                      alt="giphy"
                ></p>
<p>The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.</p>
<p>Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.</p>
<p>It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.</p>
<h3 id="2-Motionleap-1"><a href="#2-Motionleap-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Motionleap"></a>2. Motionleap</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg"
                      alt="motionleap"
                ></p>
<p>Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there’s a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn’t put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.</p>
<p>The app’s primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.</p>
<p>You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.</p>
<p>Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you’ve paid for a Pro account.</p>
<h3 id="3-Movepic-1"><a href="#3-Movepic-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Movepic"></a>3. Movepic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg"
                      alt="movepic"
                ></p>
<p>Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that you wouldn’t be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.</p>
<h3 id="4-ImgPlay-1"><a href="#4-ImgPlay-1" class="headerlink" title="4. ImgPlay"></a>4. ImgPlay</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg"
                      alt="imgplay"
                ></p>
<p>ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can’t remove unless you update to a complete account.</p>
<p>The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.</p>
<h3 id="5-Zoetropic-1"><a href="#5-Zoetropic-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Zoetropic"></a>5. Zoetropic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg"
                      alt="zoetropic"
                ></p>
<p>If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren’t as extensive as other apps we’ve mentioned, it does the job pretty well.</p>
<p>To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.</p>
<p>On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you’re considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.</p>
<h3 id="6-StoryZ-1"><a href="#6-StoryZ-1" class="headerlink" title="6. StoryZ"></a>6. StoryZ</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg"
                      alt="storyz"
                ></p>
<p>Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.</p>
<p>One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.</p>
<h3 id="7-Lumyer-1"><a href="#7-Lumyer-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Lumyer"></a>7. Lumyer</h3><p><img

<p>Videos and GIFs are a mainstay of social media. These days it’s rare to see a still photo online. The simplicity with which you can add filter and movement effects to your images has identified a proliferation of these online animated photos.</p>
<p>So what if you wish to apply animation to a still image? There are many apps for such purposes. Given below is a selection of the best apps you can use to animate images on both Android and iPhone devices with the help of animated photo collage apps.</p>

Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.</p>
<p>Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.</p>
<h3 id="1-GIPHY-2"><a href="#1-GIPHY-2" class="headerlink" title="1. GIPHY"></a>1. GIPHY</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.</p>
<p>Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.</p>
<p>It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.</p>
<h3 id="2-Motionleap-2"><a href="#2-Motionleap-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Motionleap"></a>2. Motionleap</h3><p><img

                      alt="motionleap"
                ></p>
<p>Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.</p>
<p>Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there’s a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn’t put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.</p>
<p>The app’s primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.</p>
<p>You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.</p>
<p>Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you’ve paid for a Pro account.</p>
<h3 id="3-Movepic-2"><a href="#3-Movepic-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Movepic"></a>3. Movepic</h3><p><img

                      alt="movepic"
                ></p>
<p>Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.</p>
<p>The only limitation is that you wouldn’t be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.</p>
<h3 id="4-ImgPlay-2"><a href="#4-ImgPlay-2" class="headerlink" title="4. ImgPlay"></a>4. ImgPlay</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg"
                      alt="imgplay"
                ></p>
<p>ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can’t remove unless you update to a complete account.</p>
<p>The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.</p>
<h3 id="5-Zoetropic-2"><a href="#5-Zoetropic-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Zoetropic"></a>5. Zoetropic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg"
                      alt="zoetropic"
                ></p>
<p>If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren’t as extensive as other apps we’ve mentioned, it does the job pretty well.</p>
<p>To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.</p>
<p>On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you’re considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.</p>
<h3 id="6-StoryZ-2"><a href="#6-StoryZ-2" class="headerlink" title="6. StoryZ"></a>6. StoryZ</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg"
                      alt="storyz"
                ></p>
<p>Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.</p>
<p>One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.</p>
<h3 id="7-Lumyer-2"><a href="#7-Lumyer-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Lumyer"></a>7. Lumyer</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg"
                      alt="lumyer"
                ></p>
<p>Lumyer is one of the useful animated photo collage apps on our list, which lets you add hundreds and thousands of effects to your pictures to animate them. So whether you wish to include sparkle or subtle weather effects, seasonal animations for Christmas and Halloween, or all-out scene transformations like appearing on a rollercoaster, Lumyer can do it.</p>
<p>If you’re okay with the watermark, Lumyer is a good choice, but otherwise, you may prefer one of our other recommended photo animation college apps.</p>
<h3 id="8-VIMAGE-3D-2"><a href="#8-VIMAGE-3D-2" class="headerlink" title="8. VIMAGE 3D"></a>8. VIMAGE 3D</h3><p><img

                      alt="vimage 3d"
                ></p>
<p>VIMAGE got recognized with Google Play award in 2018. It can make some pretty good-looking animated photos in just a few clicks. There’s a wide variety of animations, filters, and sounds to select among a bundle of options.</p>
<p>You don’t even need to select the object because VIMAGE detects and replaces it for you quite automatically.</p>
<p>Similar to these apps, you do need to pay to remove the watermark, get access to the full effects library, and you can export your photos online in up to 2560p resolution.</p>
<h3 id="9-Photo-Bender-2"><a href="#9-Photo-Bender-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Photo Bender"></a>9. Photo Bender</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-7.jpg"
                      alt="photo bender"
                ></p>
<p>Photo Bender is an Android-specific animated photo collage app that helps you warp to animate photos digitally by coloring your image by stretching it, bending it, and using brushes. You can then export your transformed images as GIFs, JPEGs, MP4s, and PNGs.</p>
<p>While this app doesn’t contain ratings like others on this list, it is highly rated, so it’s still worth a look.</p>
<h3 id="10-Werble-2"><a href="#10-Werble-2" class="headerlink" title="10. Werble"></a>10. Werble</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="werble"
                ></p>
<p>The primary purpose of Werble is to animate your images, and while the basic account is free, in-app purchases are also available. Most of Werble’s animations come through different filter effects that you can add on top of your images.</p>
<p>A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they’re ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The primary purpose of Werble is to animate your images, and while the basic account is free, in-app purchases are also available. Most of Werble’s animations come through different filter effects that you can add on top of your images.</p>
<p>A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they’re ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.</p>
