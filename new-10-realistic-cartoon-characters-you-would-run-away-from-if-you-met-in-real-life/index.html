<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-2D-Animation-Tips-for-Beginners"><a href="#Part-1-2D-Animation-Tips-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners"></a>Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners</h2><h3 id="1-Find-a-reference-in-the-real-world"><a href="#1-Find-a-reference-in-the-real-world" class="headerlink" title="1. Find a reference in the real world"></a>1. Find a reference in the real world</h3><p>This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

<h3 id="2-Observe-real-life"><a href="#2-Observe-real-life" class="headerlink" title="2. Observe real life"></a>2. Observe real life</h3><p>The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

<h3 id="3-Simplicity-is-the-key"><a href="#3-Simplicity-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="3. Simplicity is the key"></a>3. Simplicity is the key</h3><p>2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.</p>

<h3 id="4-Draw-animation-again-and-again"><a href="#4-Draw-animation-again-and-again" class="headerlink" title="4. Draw animation again and again"></a>4. Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can’t be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.</p>
<p>In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can’t master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.</p>

It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.</p>

<h3 id="6-Carefully-use-keyframing"><a href="#6-Carefully-use-keyframing" class="headerlink" title="6. Carefully use keyframing"></a>6. Carefully use keyframing</h3><p>3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The keyframes in 3D animation videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.</p>

Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.</p>
<p>This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.</p>

<h3 id="8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation"><a href="#8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation" class="headerlink" title="8. Take the rhythm in animation"></a>8. Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>

<h3 id="9-Basic-model"><a href="#9-Basic-model" class="headerlink" title="9. Basic model"></a>9. Basic model</h3><p>You may see your system working too hard when you use a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/" >high-res model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.</p>

A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.</p>

Find a reference in the real world"></a>1. Find a reference in the real world</h3><p>This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

<h3 id="2-Observe-real-life-1"><a href="#2-Observe-real-life-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Observe real life"></a>2. Observe real life</h3><p>The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

Simplicity is the key</h3><p>2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.</p>

It can’t be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.</p>
<p>In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can’t master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.</p>

Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.</p>
<p>This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.</p>

<h3 id="8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation-1"><a href="#8-Take-the-rhythm-in-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Take the rhythm in animation"></a>8. Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>

<h3 id="9-Basic-model-1"><a href="#9-Basic-model-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Basic model"></a>9. Basic model</h3><p>You may see your system working too hard when you use a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/" >high-res model <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.</p>

A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.</p>

Take the rhythm in animation</h3><p>For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.</p>

A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.</p>

Find a reference in the real world"></a>1. Find a reference in the real world</h3><p>This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/" >voice-over artists <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.</p>

<h3 id="2-Observe-real-life-3"><a href="#2-Observe-real-life-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Observe real life"></a>2. Observe real life</h3><p>The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/" >how emotion can be portrayed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and choose each movement carefully.</p>
<p>Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.</p>

<h3 id="3-Simplicity-is-the-key-3"><a href="#3-Simplicity-is-the-key-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Simplicity is the key"></a>3. Simplicity is the key</h3><p>2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.</p>

<h3 id="4-Draw-animation-again-and-again-3"><a href="#4-Draw-animation-again-and-again-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Draw animation again and again"></a>4. Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can’t be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.</p>
<p>In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can’t master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.</p>
