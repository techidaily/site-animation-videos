<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>

High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-1"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-2"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-3"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to sharpen the picture by 50%. This is available in the picture corrections effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, copy the image and paste it back as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Repeat these steps four times to make the lines in the image stand out sharply.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, add the color effect of Black and White at 20%.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You will get quite a fairly detailed output.</p>
