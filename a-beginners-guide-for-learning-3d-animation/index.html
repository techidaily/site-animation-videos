<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p>Arguably the hilarious moment of online communication, GIFs are a sequence of static images that throw a unique effect when strung together. They add excitement to social media posts, energy to email conversations, and even standard text, and usually create the internet (and this post) the funniest place to be.</p>
<p>Many people like to create GIFs on their websites, on digital platforms, or within their social media. We’ve collected a list of the best-animated GIF text makers around and reviewed them, so you don’t have to. You’ve come to the perfect article if you’re also one among them.</p>
<h2 id="Top-7-Animated-GIF-Text-Makers-2022"><a href="#Top-7-Animated-GIF-Text-Makers-2022" class="headerlink" title="Top 7 Animated GIF Text Makers 2022"></a>Top 7 Animated GIF Text Makers 2022</h2><p>Without further ado, let’s jump in! Here are the five best-recommended websites or text GIF makers worth considering in 2021.</p>
<h3 id="1-Bloggif"><a href="#1-Bloggif" class="headerlink" title="1. Bloggif"></a>1. Bloggif</h3><p><img

                      alt="bloggif"
                ></p>
<p>This site shows an appropriate GIF for just about anything you’re wondering. Based upon what you’re looking for, there are numerous ways to uncover a perfect match.</p>
<p>One way is to search among the dropdown menus on the main website’s interface. These menus allow users to surface GIFs such as animated text, resize a picture, GIF slideshow, GIF effect, and more.</p>
<h3 id="2-Gfycat"><a href="#2-Gfycat" class="headerlink" title="2. Gfycat"></a>2. Gfycat</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/web-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="gfycat"
                ></p>
<p>Gfycat is another online text GIF maker with millions of GIFs to dive into as a GIF text generator. Not only is it one of the highly famous GIF sites, but it has a simple animated GIF text maker to turn your favorite Vimeo, Twitter, and Twitch streams into your library of memes.</p>
<p>You can easily navigate its wide variety of GIFs from the search bar or left menu, select from the latest “Explore” or “Trending” section to look for multiple categories of stickers or GIFs.</p>
<h3 id="3-GIPHY"><a href="#3-GIPHY" class="headerlink" title="3. GIPHY"></a>3. GIPHY</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/web-text-gif-3.jpg"
                      alt="giphy"
                ></p>
<p>This is another go-to resource for text GIF maker hunting. Alex Chung and Jace Cooke launched it; GIPHY began as a search engine for GIFs. The platform has seen significant growth by introducing integrations, partnering with brands, and making browser extensions, and a lot more. (Check out GIPHY Labs to explore their expansion efforts.)</p>
<p>The best part? Looking for the database of GIFs couldn’t be easier: Users can browse categories — Music, Adjectives, Nature, Science, Nature, etc. — or seek out a specific phrase or a word using the search feature.</p>
<h3 id="4-Make-a-GIF"><a href="#4-Make-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a GIF"></a>4. Make a GIF</h3><p><img

                      alt="make a gif"
                ></p>
<p>Make A GIF allows you to create a GIF from many images, a video from your computer, a Facebook or YouTube video, or directly from your webcam.</p>
<p>With this tool, it’s pretty simple to customize the order of the photos and rearrange them via drag-and-drop editor. You can also resize its images and create a personalized animation speed. In addition, there is a captioning tool included to add text on top of your GIF, but you can’t preview it before creating the GIF or change where the text GIF maker is displayed.</p>
<p>You can save the GIF to your PC and copy its URL to find it online once created. It further consists of options for making your GIF public, private, or unlisted. You can even link directly to the GIF file.</p>
<h3 id="5-ImgFlip"><a href="#5-ImgFlip" class="headerlink" title="5. ImgFlip"></a>5. ImgFlip</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/web-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="imgflip"
                ></p>
<p>ImgFlip displays a preview of your GIF during the creation, which is valuable. You can develop these GIFs from images, a GIF URL, a video URL, or a video you upload yourself.</p>
<p>Besides, you can alter animation delay, width, height, photo order, and quality for a GIF created with images. There’s also a crop option, text tool, and the ability to rotate the GIF, change the play count, reverse it, and change the background color.</p>
<p>You can download your GIF and share it over a few social media sites once done, or not post it online while setting it as private.</p>
<p>A watermark displayed on all GIFs created is here at Imgflip. Also, most of the custom settings for making a GIF from this GIF text generator are usable only if you subscribe to ImgFlip Pro.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-Make-animated-GIF-Text-in-video"><a href="#Tip-Make-animated-GIF-Text-in-video" class="headerlink" title="Tip: Make animated GIF Text in video"></a>Tip: Make animated GIF Text in video</h3><p>Now you may be wandering to create your GIF.

They add excitement to social media posts, energy to email conversations, and even standard text, and usually create the internet (and this post) the funniest place to be.</p>
<p>Many people like to create GIFs on their websites, on digital platforms, or within their social media. We’ve collected a list of the best-animated GIF text makers around and reviewed them, so you don’t have to. You’ve come to the perfect article if you’re also one among them.</p>

Here are the five best-recommended websites or text GIF makers worth considering in 2021.</p>
<h3 id="1-Bloggif-3"><a href="#1-Bloggif-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Bloggif"></a>1. Bloggif</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>This site shows an appropriate GIF for just about anything you’re wondering. Based upon what you’re looking for, there are numerous ways to uncover a perfect match.</p>
<p>One way is to search among the dropdown menus on the main website’s interface. These menus allow users to surface GIFs such as animated text, resize a picture, GIF slideshow, GIF effect, and more.</p>

<p>02 [How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [5 Amazing Blender 2D Animation Examples](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blender-2D-Animation-As-Awesome-AS-3D-3"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blender-2D-Animation-As-Awesome-AS-3D-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blender 2D Animation As Awesome AS 3D?"></a>Part 1 Is Blender 2D Animation As Awesome AS 3D?</h2><p>There’s no arguing the fact that Blender is a remarkable tool for 3D animations. Its worldwide popularity is clear proof of what one can achieve while creating a 3D animation with Blender. But, the real question is - are Blender 2D animations as good as their 3D alternatives. Well, the answer is Yes! Blender has a built-in feature known as Grease Pencil that’s specifically designed to create 2D animations. With Grease Pencil, you can create different 2D layouts from scratch and turn them into visually appealing animations to engage the potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?"></a>Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?</h2><p>So, how can you create 2D animations in Blender? Well, it depends! The process to create a 2D animation in Blender mainly depends on what you want to design. You can find different Blender 2D animation tutorials on YouTube and use them to get started with 2D animations in Blender. But, we would like to point out that there’s a generic process that’ll remain consistent in every situation. If you are also getting started with creating 2D animations in Blender, here’s the step-by-step process that’ll help you start sailing in the right direction and make the 2D animation designing a hassle-free task.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-3"><a href="#Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>First and foremost, launch Blender on your system and set it up to get started. On the home screen, click on “File&gt;New” and then, select “2D Animation”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-1.jpg"
                      alt="file new blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-2.jpg"
                      alt="design image blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.</p>
<h5 id="Step-4-3"><a href="#Step-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-3.jpg"
                      alt="array modifier blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5-3"><a href="#Step-5-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5"></a>Step 5</h5><p>Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you’ve drawn on the screen and then, select “Rotation and Scale”. A separate editing window will pop up on your screen. Here you can customize the movement of the object by changing its scaling options through keyframing.</p>
<p>That’s it; your 2D animation is now ready and you can save it on your computer.</p>
