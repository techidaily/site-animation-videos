<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>
<h3 id="01Fred-Flintstone"><a href="#01Fred-Flintstone" class="headerlink" title="01Fred Flintstone"></a>01Fred Flintstone</h3><p><img

                      alt="fred flintstone"

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

                      alt="mickey mouse"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

                      alt="spongebob squarepant"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

                      alt="tom and jerry"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1950<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Charles M. Schulz<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1940<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices</p>
<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2014<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Will Arnett</p>
<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain.

However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<p>For this list, we’ll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history’s finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It’s impossible to choose the “best” <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong> in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of “the show is for the toy”).</p>

<p>The best part about cartoons is that there’s something for everyone. There are <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> that are humorous, cute, and cool.</p>
<p>Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.</p>
<p>We thought to update our list of the 12 most <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we’ll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they’re from the program itself or related comics and books.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1960<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others</p>
<p>Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).</p>
<p>Fred Flintstone, the <strong>iconic cartoon character</strong>, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He’s still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1928<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices</p>
<p>Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney’s legendary Disney short “Steamboat Willie,” the public domain will glimpse the mouse.</p>
<p>Walt Disney initially produced the <strong>most iconic cartoon character</strong> Mickey Mouse in 1928. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1999<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Stephen Hillenburg<br><strong>Voice by</strong> Tom Kenny  </p>
<p>Although Sponge’s nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents’ liking, Tom Kenny’s renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers’ brains all across the world after two decades of programming.</p>
<p>For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It’s a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.</p>
<p>The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.</p>
<p>SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1941<br><strong>Creators:</strong> William Hanna, Joseph Barbera<br><strong>Voices:</strong> William Hanna and various other voices</p>
<p>The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer’s theatrical short films.</p>
<p>Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> star in the original shorts. They don’t always get along, but they’re usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.</p>
<p>Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1987<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Matt Groening<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Dan Castellaneta</p>
<p>The Simpsons’ first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.</p>
<p>Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1950<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Charles M. Schulz<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy’s Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy’s crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.</p>
<p>Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You’ve undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven’t heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children’s characters who are appreciated by many.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 1940<br><strong>Creators:</strong> Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery<br><strong>Voices:</strong> Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices</p>
<p>The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Samantha’s pistols, or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.</p>
<p>Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo and Shaggy’s narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo’s incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.</p>
<p>Norville “Shaggy” Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.</p>

<p>The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children’s books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie’s friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.</p>

<p>While many <strong>iconic cartoon characters</strong> have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain’s not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.</p>

<p>The Powerpuff Girls, the i<strong>conic female cartoon characters</strong> and the ideal vanguard of “you can be pretty and yet kick-ass,” emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.</p>

<p><strong>Created:</strong> 2014<br><strong>Creator:</strong> Raphael Bob-Waksberg<br><strong>Voice:</strong> Will Arnett</p>
<p>The redemption arc of Will Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn’t love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up ‘90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.</p>

<p>That’s right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can’t seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko’s narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>
<p>Once everything is complete, click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the <strong>Preview</strong> window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the <strong>animated travel map</strong> in your preferred format.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                      alt="create travel map video with pictramap "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-2"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers&#x2F;creators of the symbols while using their objects.

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>
<p>Once everything is complete, click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the <strong>Preview</strong> window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the <strong>animated travel map</strong> in your preferred format.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>
<p><img

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-3"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers&#x2F;creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms &amp; Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-animation-animated-travel-map.jpg"
                      alt="add animations to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg"
                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>
<p>Once everything is complete, click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the <strong>Preview</strong> window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the <strong>animated travel map</strong> in your preferred format.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                      alt="create travel map video with pictramap "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview the Animation</strong></p>
<p>Click the <strong>View Animation</strong> button from the upper-right corner of the page to see the <strong>animated travel map</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-3.png"
                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png"
                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"
                      alt="Canva page animations"
                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video"><a href="#2-3-Video" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-1"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-1"><a href="#2-1-Image-1" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-2-Text-1"><a href="#2-2-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-3"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png"
                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-3"><a href="#2-1-Image-3" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"
                      alt="Canva page animations"
                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text-3"><a href="#2-2-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video-3"><a href="#2-3-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>

This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>

<h2 id="Top-10-Star-vs-the-Forces-of-Evil"><a href="#Top-10-Star-vs-the-Forces-of-Evil" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Star vs. the Forces of Evil"></a>Top 10 <strong>Star vs. the Forces of Evil</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 2015–2019 [4 Seasons, 22m per episode]</p>
<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Animation, Action, Adventure</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: TV-Y7</p>
<p><strong>Metascore</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p><strong>Director</strong>: Aaron Hammersley, Dominic Bisignano, Brett Varon, Sabrina Cotugno, Piero Piluso, Tyler Chen, Giancarlo Volpe, David Wasson, Michael Mullen , John Davis Infantino, and Amelia Lorenz.</p>
<p><strong>Stars</strong>: 7.9</p>
<p><strong>Votes</strong>: 13,266</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, ‘Star vs. the Forces of Evil’ This is an American animated ‘magical-girl’ television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)</p>
<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand — only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully</p>
<h2 id="Top-9-Gargoyles"><a href="#Top-9-Gargoyles" class="headerlink" title="Top 9   Gargoyles"></a>Top 9   <strong>Gargoyles</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1994–1996 [2 Seasons, 30m per episode]</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We go back into the older <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called ‘Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles’ instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action&#x2F;adventure show.</p>
<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.</p>

<p>This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn’t make it any less fun</p>

<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn’t make it any less fun</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The fourth most popular of the <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> on IMBD is Phineas and Ferb This is an action&#x2F;comedy series that ran all from 2007 to 2015 And yes, that does mean that this show is 100% now binge-able from start to end</p>
<p>This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn’t make it any less fun</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), ‘The Owl House’ is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)</p>
<p>The story’s main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She’s a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets “The Owl Lady” Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn’t stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.</p>

<p><strong>Stars</strong>: 7.9</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, ‘Star vs. the Forces of Evil’ This is an American animated ‘magical-girl’ television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)</p>
<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand — only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully</p>
<h2 id="Top-9-Gargoyles-3"><a href="#Top-9-Gargoyles-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 9   Gargoyles"></a>Top 9   <strong>Gargoyles</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1994–1996 [2 Seasons, 30m per episode]</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We go back into the older <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called ‘Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles’ instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action&#x2F;adventure show.</p>
<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.</p>
