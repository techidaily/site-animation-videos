Before the 2016 classic, we first meet Dory in the 2003 Pixar’s classic ‘finding Nemo’ where Dory helps Marlin, a clownfish, reunites with his son, Nemo. In ‘Finding Dory, ‘ young Dory’s amnesiac was finally brought back thirteen years later. Dory is perseverant, has a trim physique, and yet she can do whatever she has set her mind to do.</p>

He happens to be Moana’s best friend. Pua made his first appearance during the ‘Where you are’ performance alongside the village chief’s daughter. On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>
