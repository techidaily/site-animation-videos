<p>As is evident, critics of the audio regard it to be a bit hefty, though the sound is somewhat appealing to opera lovers.</p>
<h3 id="09Largo-al-Factotum-3"><a href="#09Largo-al-Factotum-3" class="headerlink" title="09Largo al Factotum"></a>09Largo al Factotum</h3><p>This high end opera was a rehearsal favorite of Giovanni Jones, the famous opera singer in The Long-Haired Hare, a well-known cartoon classic released in 1949. The star is supported in his streak by our adorable Bugs, who strums out loud on his banjo at a little distance.</p>
<p>All seemed well until Jones, in an annoyed state barges into break the poor rabbit’s instruments, while stretching him upwards through his long and pointed ears. The incident eventually transforms into war by the adorable bunny, who had been enraged by the time.</p>
