<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-GIF-Illustration"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-GIF-Illustration" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?"></a>Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?</h2><p>GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.</p>
<p>Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.</p>
<p>These are now used as everything from advertisements to commentary from all walks of life. The users of GIFs seem to be endless! They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Best-12-Illusion-Gifs"><a href="#Part-2-Best-12-Illusion-Gifs" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs"></a>Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs</h2><p>This curated list will help you to know the best <strong>Illusion GIF</strong> that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-</p>
<h3 id="01Van-Gogh-Stare-GIF"><a href="#01Van-Gogh-Stare-GIF" class="headerlink" title="01Van Gogh Stare GIF"></a>01Van Gogh Stare GIF</h3><p>The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the “dazzle camouflage,” is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye’s instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/9tXAXIgFsKyuotYjDh" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02This-brain-busting-rotation"><a href="#02This-brain-busting-rotation" class="headerlink" title="02This brain-busting rotation"></a>02This brain-busting rotation</h3><p>We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can’t see it from every angle.</p>
<h3 id="03This-loop-tea-GIF"><a href="#03This-loop-tea-GIF" class="headerlink" title="03This loop tea GIF"></a>03This loop tea GIF</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn’t make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/meme-image-know-K79kKDx86GMik" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="04No-smkoing-Well-you-should-never"><a href="#04No-smkoing-Well-you-should-never" class="headerlink" title="04No smkoing! Well, you should never"></a>04No smkoing! Well, you should never</h3><p>The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you’ll notice that there’s actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it’s not really a head either - it’s just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.</p>
<p>The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren’t always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are</p>
<h3 id="05The-never-ending-corridor"><a href="#05The-never-ending-corridor" class="headerlink" title="05The never-ending corridor"></a>05The never-ending corridor</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.</p>
<p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can’t process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.</p>
<h3 id="06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser"><a href="#06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser" class="headerlink" title="06Now, this, the eye-pleaser"></a>06Now, this, the eye-pleaser</h3><p>The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there’s only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="07Commercial-At-design-GIF"><a href="#07Commercial-At-design-GIF" class="headerlink" title="07Commercial At design GIF"></a>07Commercial At design GIF</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="08Wait-what-Is-this-truly-a-reflection"><a href="#08Wait-what-Is-this-truly-a-reflection" class="headerlink" title="08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?"></a>08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?</h3><p>This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what’s really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it’s just inverted.</p>
<h3 id="09This-haunting-tableau-Not-exactly-a-GIF-but-worth-sharing"><a href="#09This-haunting-tableau-Not-exactly-a-GIF-but-worth-sharing" class="headerlink" title="09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)"></a>09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.</p>
<h3 id="10This-safety-hazard"><a href="#10This-safety-hazard" class="headerlink" title="10This safety hazard"></a>10This safety hazard</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="11Welcome-to-the-3d-World"><a href="#11Welcome-to-the-3d-World" class="headerlink" title="11Welcome to the 3d World"></a>11Welcome to the 3d World</h3><p>It’s an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.</p>

<h3 id="12I-will-keep-this-table-forever"><a href="#12I-will-keep-this-table-forever" class="headerlink" title="12I will keep this table forever"></a>12I will keep this table forever</h3><p>The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.</p>

The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.</p>

This includes:-</p>
<h3 id="01Van-Gogh-Stare-GIF-2"><a href="#01Van-Gogh-Stare-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="01Van Gogh Stare GIF"></a>01Van Gogh Stare GIF</h3><p>The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the “dazzle camouflage,” is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye’s instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/9tXAXIgFsKyuotYjDh" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can’t see it from every angle.</p>
<h3 id="03This-loop-tea-GIF-2"><a href="#03This-loop-tea-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="03This loop tea GIF"></a>03This loop tea GIF</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn’t make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.</p>

Well, you should never</h3><p>The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you’ll notice that there’s actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it’s not really a head either - it’s just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.</p>
<p>The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren’t always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are</p>
<h3 id="05The-never-ending-corridor-2"><a href="#05The-never-ending-corridor-2" class="headerlink" title="05The never-ending corridor"></a>05The never-ending corridor</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.</p>
<p>This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can’t process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.</p>
<h3 id="06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser-2"><a href="#06Now-this-the-eye-pleaser-2" class="headerlink" title="06Now, this, the eye-pleaser"></a>06Now, this, the eye-pleaser</h3><p>The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there’s only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE" >via GIPHY <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="07Commercial-At-design-GIF-2"><a href="#07Commercial-At-design-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="07Commercial At design GIF"></a>07Commercial At design GIF</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.</p>

Is this truly a reflection?</h3><p>This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what’s really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it’s just inverted.</p>
<h3 id="09This-haunting-tableau-Not-exactly-a-GIF-but-worth-sharing-2"><a href="#09This-haunting-tableau-Not-exactly-a-GIF-but-worth-sharing-2" class="headerlink" title="09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)"></a>09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)</h3><p>The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.</p>
<h3 id="10This-safety-hazard-2"><a href="#10This-safety-hazard-2" class="headerlink" title="10This safety hazard"></a>10This safety hazard</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.</p>

<p>It’s also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it’s just inverted.</p>

The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.</p>
<h3 id="10This-safety-hazard-3"><a href="#10This-safety-hazard-3" class="headerlink" title="10This safety hazard"></a>10This safety hazard</h3><p>This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.</p>

The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.</p>

<h2 id="Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？"><a href="#Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？" class="headerlink" title="Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？"></a>Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？</h2><p>What makes anime boys so attractive is their gentle demeanor. Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an <strong>anime boy</strong> is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.</p>
<p>Also, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese don’t desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, <strong>a male anime character</strong> is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!</p>

<h2 id="Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-1"><a href="#Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？"></a>Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？</h2><p>What makes anime boys so attractive is their gentle demeanor. Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an <strong>anime boy</strong> is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.</p>
<p>Also, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese don’t desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, <strong>a male anime character</strong> is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!</p>

<h2 id="Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-2"><a href="#Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？"></a>Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？</h2><p>What makes anime boys so attractive is their gentle demeanor. Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an <strong>anime boy</strong> is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.</p>
<p>Also, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese don’t desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, <strong>a male anime character</strong> is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!</p>

<h2 id="Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-3"><a href="#Why-Anime-Boys-Are-Attractive？-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？"></a>Why Anime Boys Are Attractive？</h2><p>What makes anime boys so attractive is their gentle demeanor. Anime has given a different touch to masculinity as compared to western shows - where an attractive man is usually portrayed as a tall macho dude with 6 packs. However, the concept of an <strong>anime boy</strong> is generally someone with a soft, cute, lithe yet athletic and badass personality. These hardcore tough guys have feminine qualities which set them apart from the mainstream heartthrobs like Chris Evans as Captain America or Zac Efron as Matt Brody.</p>
<p>Also, the ideal Japanese male is also much different than a Western guy. Japanese don’t desire strong, muscular, handsome Greek God-looking men. For them, the idea of an attractive man is a cool, laidback, charming, gentle guy with adorable looks and a goofy personality. Thus, <strong>a male anime character</strong> is a perfect combination of manly and sensitive - and women love that!</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-1"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg"
                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-12"><a href="#Pros-12" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-12"><a href="#Cons-12" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-13"><a href="#Pros-13" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-13"><a href="#Cons-13" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-14"><a href="#Pros-14" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-14"><a href="#Cons-14" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

                      alt="Cartoon Lens on Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

<p><strong>Anime Filter #9: Comics Style</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="Comics Style Lens from Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>Again, we’re moving towards a different kind of animation style with this next filter from Snapchat, but the Comics Style filter does have its own promises of fun as well Especially for those who are long-time fans of American comics (or, even, your average modern-day Avengers fan)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-2"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg"
                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-24"><a href="#Pros-24" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-24"><a href="#Cons-24" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-25"><a href="#Pros-25" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-25"><a href="#Cons-25" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-26"><a href="#Pros-26" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-26"><a href="#Cons-26" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

                      alt="Cartoon Lens on Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

                ></p>
<p>Again, we’re moving towards a different kind of animation style with this next filter from Snapchat, but the Comics Style filter does have its own promises of fun as well Especially for those who are long-time fans of American comics (or, even, your average modern-day Avengers fan)</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, this might get confusing, but for our last picks, we actually have a set of filters all called <strong>Cartoon 3D Style</strong> But trust us They’re all different This first version is one you would probably relate more to the DreamWorks motion picture, Ratatouille</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>

                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-36"><a href="#Pros-36" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-36"><a href="#Cons-36" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-37"><a href="#Pros-37" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>

<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-38"><a href="#Pros-38" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>

<h5 id="Cons-38"><a href="#Cons-38" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

<p>Canva is a graphic design platform that allows users to create stunning designs for social media posts, presentations, assignments, recipe cards, birthday videos.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Canva’s animation feature, a whole new world of possibilities are open to the public. Also, with pre-designed templates from professional designers, content creation has never been easier than Canva.</p>
<p>Animations themselves have the option of being individually customized element by element. Canva animated graphics makes it easy to unleash your creative potential.</p>
<p>This article will explore how to animate graphics in Canva that can suit every occasion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Animate Your Graphic In Canva](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva</h2><p>People can create animations in Canva in one of two ways. You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>
<p>● A4 Documents</p>
<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>
<p>● YouTube Thumbnails</p>
<p>● Presentation</p>
<p>● Flyer&#x2F;Poster</p>
<p>● Instagram Logo</p>
<p>● Infographic</p>
<p>These options generate the ability to be presented in both portrait and landscape mode. The multitude of options makes it an ideal medium for you to create your animation. The animation options at Canva also come with the opportunity to animate an existing image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-1.png"
                      alt="Free Animated Presentation"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-3.png"
                      alt="Animating Images in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva"><a href="#2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?"></a>2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?</h3><p>Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva"><a href="#2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?"></a>2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?</h3><p>Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>

<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>

Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>

<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>

<p>Canva is a graphic design platform that allows users to create stunning designs for social media posts, presentations, assignments, recipe cards, birthday videos.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Canva’s animation feature, a whole new world of possibilities are open to the public. Also, with pre-designed templates from professional designers, content creation has never been easier than Canva.</p>
<p>Animations themselves have the option of being individually customized element by element. Canva animated graphics makes it easy to unleash your creative potential.</p>

You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>
<p>● A4 Documents</p>
<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>
<p>● YouTube Thumbnails</p>
<p>● Presentation</p>
<p>● Flyer&#x2F;Poster</p>
<p>● Instagram Logo</p>
<p>● Infographic</p>
<p>These options generate the ability to be presented in both portrait and landscape mode. The multitude of options makes it an ideal medium for you to create your animation. The animation options at Canva also come with the opportunity to animate an existing image.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-3"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-3"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva-3"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>

The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva-3"><a href="#2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?"></a>2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?</h3><p>Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>
