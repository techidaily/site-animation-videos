<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>

Whether it be about <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender facial rigging</strong>, <strong>free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs</strong>, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.</p>
<h3 id="01Where-to-Learn-the-Course"><a href="#01Where-to-Learn-the-Course" class="headerlink" title="01Where to Learn the Course?"></a>01<strong>Where to Learn the Course?</strong></h3><p>The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters’ <strong>blender rigging</strong> course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.</p>

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>

However, this is a general way of answering the important question. There are several reasons that make it necessary and beneficial for you to integrate <strong>animated graphics for websites</strong> for marketing your brand name. And they are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="01-Eye-catching"><a href="#01-Eye-catching" class="headerlink" title="01 Eye-catching"></a>01 Eye-catching</h3><p>One of the most important reasons for your marketing to include animated graphics is that they catch the attention of the audience more than any other method of marketing. They are interesting and fun, and that is the feature that attracts the attention of the audience. They get to see your brand in a more exciting and exciting way. Consequently, marketing your brand becomes ideally effective.</p>

<h3 id="02-Easily-informative"><a href="#02-Easily-informative" class="headerlink" title="02 Easily informative"></a>02 Easily informative</h3><p>The motive for marketing is to inform the audience and other people about different information about your brand or company. Often, conveying information about your brands, services, and products becomes uninteresting for the audience. To make it more appealing, animated graphics can do the perfect job. They are fascinating to watch and deliver all the required information in a new and novel way. This does not bore the audience. Instead, if the animations are unique and exciting, people can actually be interested in watching them at will.</p>

And it is not just about the needs; it can be based on the audience genre you have. For example, if your products or services are meant for the kids, the animation will be made according to those factors that appeal to the kids. If your brand is for senior citizens, the animations will be different. Most importantly, if your brand shifts its audience genre, animations can also be created in the genre that you are choosing to serve at present. Thus, the customization ability of graphics animation offers flexibility in marketing.</p>

<p>Making an overall excellent and unique <strong>character design cartoon art style</strong> is sometimes hard. The truth is that everyone has a favorite cartoon character, but the question is, how does this character come to life? While you are about to start copying other well-known cartoon or comic characters, you will eventually branch out and come with your own. In addition, there are several ways to come up with ideas for cartoon characters’ concept art to draw. Any of these ways can get you started on populating your world of cartoons.</p>

But need to exert a vast amount of skill and effort to make them effective.</p>

They are;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Do not lose the magic</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.</p>
<p>The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.</p>

                      alt="cartoon character design tips 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Avoid reference material</strong></p>
<p>Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn’t have the reference material right in front of you as you work.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make research on other characters</strong></p>
<p>For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Also, take a look elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character’s posture or idea’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Try not to lose sight of the original idea</strong></p>
<p>It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Exaggerate</strong></p>
<p>When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters’ essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Decide the aim of your character design</strong></p>
<p>When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your ‘thing.’ Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make your character distinctive</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create clear silhouettes</strong></p>
<p>A silhouette is required to help you understand the character’s gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character ‘reads’ and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Consider line quality</strong></p>

They are;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Do not lose the magic</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.</p>
<p>The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.</p>

                      alt="cartoon character design tips 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Avoid reference material</strong></p>
<p>Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn’t have the reference material right in front of you as you work.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make research on other characters</strong></p>
<p>For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Also, take a look elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character’s posture or idea’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Try not to lose sight of the original idea</strong></p>
<p>It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Exaggerate</strong></p>
<p>When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters’ essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Decide the aim of your character design</strong></p>
<p>When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your ‘thing.’ Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make your character distinctive</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create clear silhouettes</strong></p>
<p>A silhouette is required to help you understand the character’s gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character ‘reads’ and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Consider line quality</strong></p>
<p>Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.</p>

<p>The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Avoid reference material</strong></p>
<p>Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn’t have the reference material right in front of you as you work.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make research on other characters</strong></p>
<p>For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Also, take a look elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character’s posture or idea’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Try not to lose sight of the original idea</strong></p>
<p>It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Exaggerate</strong></p>
<p>When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters’ essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Decide the aim of your character design</strong></p>
<p>When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your ‘thing.’ Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make your character distinctive</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create clear silhouettes</strong></p>
<p>A silhouette is required to help you understand the character’s gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character ‘reads’ and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Consider line quality</strong></p>
<p>Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-20"><a href="#In-this-article-20" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Top 10 3D Text Animation Templates ](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates](#Part 3)</p>
<p>04 [Secrets to Learning More Animation Tactics](#Part 4)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png"
                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png"
                      alt="Add Text"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets"><a href="#01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets" class="headerlink" title="01Step 2. Use Animation Presets"></a>01Step 2. Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Use Text Animation Presets"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation"><a href="#01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01Step 3. Per-Character Animation"></a>01Step 3. Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Add Graphic Elements to Text</h3><p>If you really want to make your <strong>3D Animation Text</strong> pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles"><a href="#09Bold-Titles" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-4"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-4" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you don’t have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> SECRET TIP! If you’re looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It’s a video editor, first and foremost, but that’s not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!</p>

<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>

Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-1"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-1" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal-1"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal-1" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-1"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-1"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-1" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-1"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-1" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-1"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-1" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-1"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-1" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want.

<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-1"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-1" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-1"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-1" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-1"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you.

Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png"
                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets-3"><a href="#01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 2. Use Animation Presets"></a>01Step 2. Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation-3"><a href="#01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 3. Per-Character Animation"></a>01Step 3. Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-3"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-3" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal-3"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal-3" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-3"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-3"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-3" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-3"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-3" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-3"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-3" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-3"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-3" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-3"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-3" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-3"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-3" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-3"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>
<h3 id="01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template"><a href="#01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template" class="headerlink" title="01Company Presentation PowerPoint Template"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm_campaign=elements_af_493214&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius&mp=Theme%20Junkie"><strong>Company Presentation PowerPoint Template</strong></a></h3><p>For the first of the <strong>Moving Animation PowerPoint</strong> templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Open Project.</strong></h3><p>First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)</p>

Add Animation.</strong></h3><p>Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="03Step-3-Choose-Animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Choose-Animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Choose Animation."></a>03<strong>Step 3. Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Choose Motion Path Animation</strong></h3><p>In order to make <strong>motion animation in PowerPoint</strong>, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.</p>
<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions"><a href="#01Transitions" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations"><a href="#02Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start"><a href="#03Animation-Start" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png"
                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay"><a href="#05Animation-Delay" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Separate into Sections with Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add Animation - Emphasis"
                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Add Animation - Exit"
                ></p>
<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>
<h3 id="01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template-1"><a href="#01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="01Company Presentation PowerPoint Template"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm_campaign=elements_af_493214&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius&mp=Theme%20Junkie"><strong>Company Presentation PowerPoint Template</strong></a></h3><p>For the first of the <strong>Moving Animation PowerPoint</strong> templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>

Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>

<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-1"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-1"><a href="#01Transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-1"><a href="#02Animations-1" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-1"><a href="#03Animation-Start-1" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-1"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-1"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-1" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-1"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-1" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-1"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-1" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-1"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-1" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add Animation - Emphasis"
                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-1"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-1" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-1"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-1" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Open Project.</strong></h3><p>First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)</p>

Add Animation.</strong></h3><p>Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)</p>

<h3 id="03Step-3-Choose-Animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Choose-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Choose Animation."></a>03<strong>Step 3. Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Choose Motion Path Animation</strong></h3><p>In order to make <strong>motion animation in PowerPoint</strong>, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.</p>
<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-2"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-2"><a href="#01Transitions-2" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-2"><a href="#02Animations-2" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-2"><a href="#03Animation-Start-2" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-2"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-2" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-2"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-2" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Delay"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-2"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-2" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-2"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-2" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-2"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-2" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add Animation - Emphasis"
                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-2"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-2" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-2"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-2" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>

It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Open Project.</strong></h3><p>First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)</p>

Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>
<p><img

<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-3"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-3"><a href="#01Transitions-3" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-3"><a href="#02Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-3"><a href="#03Animation-Start-3" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-3"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-3" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-3"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-3" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-3"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-3" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-3"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-3" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-3"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-3" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-3"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-3" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-3"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-3" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
