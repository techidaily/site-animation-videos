The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>

<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>

<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

<p>While there are different ways to enhance the overall user experience of a website, using an <strong>animated sticky navbar</strong> is the most ideal solution to get the job done.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll walk you through some of the top benefits of animated sticky navbars and why you should incorporate them in your website’s design. So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-Animated-Sticky-Navbar"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-Animated-Sticky-Navbar" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is an Animated Sticky Navbar?"></a>Part 1 What is an Animated Sticky Navbar?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, an <strong>animated sticky navbar</strong> is a dedicated header that stays fixed on the website, irrespective of the web page you’re accessing. Ideally, designers use a sticky navbar to allow website visitors to visit any web page within 2-3 clicks.</p>
<p>The <strong>animated navbar</strong> also incorporates a few animations that uplift the overall visual appearance of the website. It doesn’t matter if you are planning to design an e-commerce store or a simple service-based website, the animated navbar will allow you to make your website more user-friendly for the end-users.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-An-Animated-Sticky-Navbar"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-An-Animated-Sticky-Navbar" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Are the Benefits of An Animated Sticky Navbar?"></a>Part 2 What Are the Benefits of An Animated Sticky Navbar?</h2><p>Now, there are endless benefits of using an <strong>animated sticky navbar</strong> on your website. However, these are a few factors that make <strong>animated sticky navbars</strong> the most useful on-page element of a website.</p>
<h3 id="01Quick-Navigation"><a href="#01Quick-Navigation" class="headerlink" title="01Quick Navigation"></a>01Quick Navigation</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, easy navigation is one of the key features of a sticky navbar. You can place links to all the other web pages within the navbar in the form of drop-down menus and ensure that users can visit any webpage within a single click. This will enhance the overall user experience and you’ll be able to encourage one-time visitors to spend more time on your website. Using the navbar will also improve your search engine rankings because the search engine crawler will be able to crawl all the web pages easily.</p>
<h3 id="02Aesthetically-Pleasing"><a href="#02Aesthetically-Pleasing" class="headerlink" title="02Aesthetically Pleasing"></a>02Aesthetically Pleasing</h3><p>The way your website looks has a huge impact on whether you’re going to retain the website visitors or not. An <strong>animated sticky navbar</strong> will make your website look aesthetically pleasing and captivate the visitors more effectively. You can add different animations and visual elements to the navbar and make them match your website’s overall color scheme.</p>
<h3 id="03Better-User-Experience"><a href="#03Better-User-Experience" class="headerlink" title="03Better User Experience"></a>03Better User Experience</h3><p>Another reason why you would want to place an <strong>animated sticky navbar</strong> on your website is that it’ll uplift the overall user experience for the website visitors. From finding easy navigation to all the web pages to ensuring that all the web pages offer the same browsing experience, a navbar will make your website engaging and it’ll become easier to captivate the users.</p>
