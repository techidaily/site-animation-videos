<p>Make A GIF allows you to create a GIF from many images, a video from your computer, a Facebook or YouTube video, or directly from your webcam.</p>
<p>With this tool, it’s pretty simple to customize the order of the photos and rearrange them via drag-and-drop editor. You can also resize its images and create a personalized animation speed. In addition, there is a captioning tool included to add text on top of your GIF, but you can’t preview it before creating the GIF or change where the text GIF maker is displayed.</p>
<p>You can save the GIF to your PC and copy its URL to find it online once created. It further consists of options for making your GIF public, private, or unlisted. You can even link directly to the GIF file.</p>

<p>With this tool, it’s pretty simple to customize the order of the photos and rearrange them via drag-and-drop editor. You can also resize its images and create a personalized animation speed. In addition, there is a captioning tool included to add text on top of your GIF, but you can’t preview it before creating the GIF or change where the text GIF maker is displayed.</p>
<p>You can save the GIF to your PC and copy its URL to find it online once created. It further consists of options for making your GIF public, private, or unlisted. You can even link directly to the GIF file.</p>

<p>ImgFlip displays a preview of your GIF during the creation, which is valuable. You can develop these GIFs from images, a GIF URL, a video URL, or a video you upload yourself.</p>
<p>Besides, you can alter animation delay, width, height, photo order, and quality for a GIF created with images. There’s also a crop option, text tool, and the ability to rotate the GIF, change the play count, reverse it, and change the background color.</p>
<p>You can download your GIF and share it over a few social media sites once done, or not post it online while setting it as private.</p>
<p>A watermark displayed on all GIFs created is here at Imgflip. Also, most of the custom settings for making a GIF from this GIF text generator are usable only if you subscribe to ImgFlip Pro.</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Top 10 3D Text Animation Templates ](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates](#Part 3)</p>
<p>04 [Secrets to Learning More Animation Tactics](#Part 4)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png"
                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png"
                      alt="Add Text"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets"><a href="#01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets" class="headerlink" title="01Step 2. Use Animation Presets"></a>01Step 2. Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Use Text Animation Presets"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation"><a href="#01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01Step 3. Per-Character Animation"></a>01Step 3. Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Add Graphic Elements to Text</h3><p>If you really want to make your <strong>3D Animation Text</strong> pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!</p>

                     lazyload

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles"><a href="#09Bold-Titles" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you don’t have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> SECRET TIP! If you’re looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It’s a video editor, first and foremost, but that’s not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets-1"><a href="#01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 2. Use Animation Presets"></a>01Step 2. Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation-1"><a href="#01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 3. Per-Character Animation"></a>01Step 3. Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-1"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-1" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal-1"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal-1" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-1"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-1"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-1" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-1"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-1" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-1"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-1" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-1"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-1" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-1"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-1" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-1"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-1" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-1"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>

<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-2"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-2" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud.

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png"
                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets-3"><a href="#01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 2. Use Animation Presets"></a>01Step 2. Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation-3"><a href="#01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 3. Per-Character Animation"></a>01Step 3. Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Add Graphic Elements to Text</h3><p>If you really want to make your <strong>3D Animation Text</strong> pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!</p>

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-3"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-3" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal-3"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal-3" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-3"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-3"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-3" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-3"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-3" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-3"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-3" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-3"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-3" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-3"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-3" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-3"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-3" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-3"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010.

We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Download the Slideshow Creator Tool</strong></p>
<p>Visit the official website of FlexClip to download and install the slideshow maker software in your preferred device.</p>

<p>After a successful installation, proceed to launch the tool in your system and wait till the software greets you with its welcome interface. Here, you will have to reach to and tap the ‘Start to Create’ button to begin with the slideshow creation process. You can also select a preset template to work on your slideshow if nothing new clicks in your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>In the tool’s creator window, navigate to the ‘Options Panel’ at the left and click on ‘More’ to select a suitable aspect ratio. Picking the 9:16 ratio would be a good choice.</p>

<p>You can proceed to include the image zoom and camera pan features within your project by clicking on the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option. You can further, modify the preset durations of transitions, effects and photos in the ‘Editing’ tab itself before adding them to the editor timeline.

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>When all the images and videos have been added, proceed to arrange them in the desired order of appearance in the slideshow, followed by adjusting their screen time and play durations through any of the methods explained above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>

Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Overlays and Filters for an Improvised Colour Scheme</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>

<p>Adobe Animate is Adobe’s very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It’s also the one that we’d recommend if you’re looking into advanced <strong>adobe animate text animation</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects"></a>Part 3 <strong>5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects</strong></h2><p>Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>
<h3 id="01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets-3"><a href="#01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets-3" class="headerlink" title="01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets"></a>01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets</h3><p>The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.</p>

To clarify, you add ‘animators’ to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a ‘selector’ in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.</p>

This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a “Text” preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!</p>

<h3 id="04METHOD-4-Path-Animation-3"><a href="#04METHOD-4-Path-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04METHOD 4: Path Animation"></a>04METHOD 4: Path Animation</h3><p>The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we’ve introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.</p>
