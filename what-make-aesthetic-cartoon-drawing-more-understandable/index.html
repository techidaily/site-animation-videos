                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Timeline Positioning of Media Files</strong></p>

<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to include the image zoom and camera pan features within your project by clicking on the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option. You can further, modify the preset durations of transitions, effects and photos in the ‘Editing’ tab itself before adding them to the editor timeline. Another way of doing the same is to drag the ends of the media files inward or outward, post the timeline adding process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Effect Play Duration Adjustments"
                ></p>

<p>When all the images and videos have been added, proceed to arrange them in the desired order of appearance in the slideshow, followed by adjusting their screen time and play durations through any of the methods explained above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Slide Transitions"
                ></p>
<p>Post the timeline adding of a transition, you can double click on the same to reach the ‘Transition Setting Window’, where you are allowed to customize the play duration and select its ‘Transition Mode’. Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Overlays and Filters for an Improvised Colour Scheme</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Record Voiceovers and Create Soundtracks</strong></p>
<p>To record a voiceover for your slideshow, navigate to the ‘Media’ tab and tap the ‘Record’ dropdown menu. Click on ‘Record Voiceover’ in the list of options that appears. The ‘Record Audio’ icon pops up and you now need to select a microphone to be used in the recording process. When you are ready, tap the ‘Record’ button to let the recording begin.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can now see your voice recording appear in the ‘Media’ tab with the previously imported media files, ready to be placed within the audio track of the project timeline. Filmora’s audio library is a storehouse of free access music and audio effects. To add one to your slideshow, navigate and click on the ‘Audio’ tab to select from the extensive Rock, Young &amp; Bright, Electronic, etc., music subcategories till you get the perfect match for your presentation.</p>

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Soundtracks"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the music tracks, place them one by one on the project timeline and move ahead with adjusting their play durations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Export Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>When you are satisfied with your work, you can export the slideshow directly from Filmora to a number of media sharing platforms. All you need to do is, navigate to and tap the ‘Export’ button in the top right corner of the editor screen and proceed to set the resolution and frame rate, and select the output file format of your created slideshow in the ‘Export Window’ that appears.</p>

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Slideshow Export Interface"

Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>

Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>

Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>
