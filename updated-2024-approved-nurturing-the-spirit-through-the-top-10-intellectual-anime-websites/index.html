<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

<p>03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 All You Need to Know About Rigging"></a>Part 1 <strong>All You Need to Know About Rigging</strong></h2><p>For this first part, we’re going to talk about <strong>Rigging</strong> in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

<h3 id="03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software"><a href="#03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="03What is Animation Rigging Software?"></a>03<strong>What is Animation Rigging Software?</strong></h3><p>Now, for the last section of this <strong>Rigging</strong> overview, let’s talk about <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

<h3 id="02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations"><a href="#02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Time Investments for Creating and Animations"></a>02<strong>Time Investments for Creating and Animations</strong></h3><p>Next, let’s talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Best-Rigging-Animation-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Best-Rigging-Animation-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?"></a>Part 3 <strong>What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?</strong></h2><p>For this final section of the guide, we’re finally moving on to our introduction to <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker"><a href="#05Animaker" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro"><a href="#06Moho-Pro" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D"><a href="#07Pencil-2D" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz"><a href="#08OpenToonz" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-4"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-4" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-1"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation-1"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-1"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-1" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-1"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-1" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom-1"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom-1" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio-1"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate-1"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate-1" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker-1"><a href="#05Animaker-1" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro-1"><a href="#06Moho-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D-1"><a href="#07Pencil-2D-1" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz-1"><a href="#08OpenToonz-1" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-5"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-5" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz-2"><a href="#08OpenToonz-2" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-6"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-6" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 All You Need to Know About Rigging"></a>Part 1 <strong>All You Need to Know About Rigging</strong></h2><p>For this first part, we’re going to talk about <strong>Rigging</strong> in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-3"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation-3"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

<h3 id="03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software-3"><a href="#03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="03What is Animation Rigging Software?"></a>03<strong>What is Animation Rigging Software?</strong></h3><p>Now, for the last section of this <strong>Rigging</strong> overview, let’s talk about <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-3"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-3" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

<h3 id="02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations-3"><a href="#02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Time Investments for Creating and Animations"></a>02<strong>Time Investments for Creating and Animations</strong></h3><p>Next, let’s talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-3"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-3" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom-3"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom-3" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio-3"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate-3"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate-3" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker-3"><a href="#05Animaker-3" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro-3"><a href="#06Moho-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D-3"><a href="#07Pencil-2D-3" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz-3"><a href="#08OpenToonz-3" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>

<p>With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools. This one works quite simply as well though. Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>

The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

<p>When it comes to <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend.

<p>The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an <strong>online photo animator</strong> and an application that you can download and install on your phone.

Well, you are right. These videos are representations of stop-motion animation, which is created with the help of plasticine clay.</p>

<p>The use of platicsine is not only restricted to the animated characters, but these are also considered for creating the ultimate surroundings. The videos are recorded in such a manner that synchronization must be established with background and character, and viewers will be able to enjoy the same. After creating the videos, they are played in quick succession to get the right appearance of the movement.</p>

It was founded in 189and since then, clamaytion videos have been able to find their way to silver screens. In earlier times, people used to dip their toes into color and then try to create artwork. But with innovation, the process has been changed and the oldest known extant clay animation film is <strong>Long Live the Bull (1926)</strong> by Joseph Sunn. The main procedure for creating this film is Claymation.</p>

<p>In the 190as well, there were some productions going on considering the claymation work, and some turned out to be successful, while some had no existence after that. For example, “Animated Putty” (1911), a historic feature by Walter R. Booth, dates back. So, yes, one can consider that this has existed for a very long time.</p>

Small projects and big budget features alike are finding new and innovative ways to combine traditional models with other digital filmmaking methodologies like character animation, green screens, etc.</p>
<p>You can see that the team behind Missing Link went to great lengths to create an incredible looking production. They used both practical rigging systems and green screens as props. They used live-action footage and computer animation for more complex water and action sequences. All of them make it more appealing to the audience.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different ways you might want to get into claymation. Hand-drawn stop animation has seen an increase in popularity lately, with people looking for new ways to explore it. Drawing frames by hand is a really satisfying experience, not only because you have the chance to explore your interests and have some fun with them, but also because it pushes you creatively to explore new limits.</p>
<p>So yes, it is right to conclude that there is a great scope for claymation video production and one must be aware of <strong>claymation animators</strong> to try their hands on it.</p>
