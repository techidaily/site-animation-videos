<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation"><a href="#023D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation-2"><a href="#023D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Some tips you can keep in mind while creating logo are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be specific to your brand. Be sure that you are not choosing a logo that may deviate customers from your brand perspective.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Always choose colors in contrast because a single color logo does not seem to be appealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure to choose a template that is easy to understand. If the template seems to be difficult to understand, a user will not be able to get it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure to choose a template that is easy to understand. If the template seems to be difficult to understand, a user will not be able to get it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blender-best-for-animation"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blender-best-for-animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blender best for animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blender best for animation?</strong></h2><p>The answer to if the Blender is suitable for animation is yes. <strong>Blender animation</strong> is the best for making animations and bringing any living to animator. This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.</strong></h2><p>This is a series for people who want to learn how to create <strong>3D blender animation</strong> characters from keeping a reference image. Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.</strong></h2><p>This is a series for people who want to learn how to create <strong>3D blender animation</strong> characters from keeping a reference image. Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blender-best-for-animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blender-best-for-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blender best for animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blender best for animation?</strong></h2><p>The answer to if the Blender is suitable for animation is yes. <strong>Blender animation</strong> is the best for making animations and bringing any living to animator. This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.</strong></h2><p>This is a series for people who want to learn how to create <strong>3D blender animation</strong> characters from keeping a reference image. Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

                      alt="Importing"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>
