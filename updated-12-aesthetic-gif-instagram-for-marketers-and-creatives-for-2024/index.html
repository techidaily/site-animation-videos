<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Custom-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-Work-1"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Custom-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-Work-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Custom Whiteboard Animation Videos Work"></a>Part 1 Why Custom Whiteboard Animation Videos Work</h2><p>The whiteboard animation video is an explainer video used to sell a product or describe a system. These animation videos are incredibly effective in communicating complex ideas and boosting attention and retention for your audience. A custom whiteboard animation video is a do-it-yourself video that does not require a template, but you need to start from scratch. Here are top reasons why you need a custom whiteboard animation video to work:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="custom whiteboard animation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When you want to describe a complex, highly technical, or intricate idea, product, or system, a custom whiteboard animated video will help you out. The more detailed an explanation is, the harder it is to focus, and people often get bored during the description. Therefore, sharing a new business process with a custom whiteboard animation with your team is more manageable. Getting your point across will maintain our interest as long as the video is playing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A custom whiteboard animation saves you the stress of hiring actors to play in your video and turn, saves costs and serious embarrassment by actors.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Custom whiteboard animation videos are helpful when you want to use social media ads or YouTube for marketing as people like them, so, therefore, it is a good chance for you to get clicks, views, and more sales.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A custom whiteboard animation helps you to tell the story of your brand.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps to reuse old audio content lying around, for example, podcast episodes. You can create pre-existing audio with a custom whiteboard animation that will help you capitalize on content that has already been created and breathe in new life.</p>
