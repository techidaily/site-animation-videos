<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>

                      alt="detach anime video"

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p> Part 2 Dub an Anime Series with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-record-anime4.jpg"
                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-anime-video6.jpg"

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

If you haven’t heard about claymations so far, you are not alone. Unfortunately, a wide range of the global population is unfamiliar with the concept of stop motion claymation.</p>

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Edit-a-Stop-Motion-Claymation-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Edit-a-Stop-Motion-Claymation-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation"></a>Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation</h2><p>At this point, you would have several hundred photographs and a script in mind to make your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong>. So, the next part would be to turn these raw images into an animation. To do this, you can use different types of video editing applications. However, we recommend using Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.</p>

<h3 id="01Puppet-Putty"><a href="#01Puppet-Putty" class="headerlink" title="01Puppet Putty"></a>01Puppet Putty</h3><p>Puppet Putty is one of the most popular clay brands that’s specifically marketed towards claymation fanatics. As compared to other available options, the Puppet Putty is comparatively softer, which means you can easily mold it into different shapes using your hands only. While the Puppet Putty works great by itself, you can also combine it with other types of clay to make your clay models more appealing.</p>
<h3 id="02Van-Aken"><a href="#02Van-Aken" class="headerlink" title="02Van Aken"></a>02Van Aken</h3><p>Van Aken is another popular clay brand that’s ideal for <strong>claymation animations</strong>. It’s one of the inexpensive clays and that’s the reason why many claymation fanatics use it to create clay models for their projects. One of the best features of the Van Aken clay is that it’s available in different colors, which means you can get creative with your models by mixing different color combinations. Some animators also mix Van Aken with Pupper Putty to make the characters look more stunning under the perfect lighting conditions.</p>
<h3 id="03Sargent-Art"><a href="#03Sargent-Art" class="headerlink" title="03Sargent Art"></a>03Sargent Art</h3><p>Sargent Art is a brand that primarily designs clays for sculpting. However, you can also use it to create clay models for your claymations. Sargent Art’s clay has the perfect blend of Wax and Oil, which makes it quite easier for the animator to sculpt different models.</p>
<h3 id="04Sculpey"><a href="#04Sculpey" class="headerlink" title="04Sculpey"></a>04Sculpey</h3><p>Sculpey is a clay brand that designs polymer-based clays that are relatively better than the traditional ceramic mud clays. This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="05Plastilina"><a href="#05Plastilina" class="headerlink" title="05Plastilina"></a>05Plastilina</h3><p>Finally, Plastilina is also a great option for <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> models. You can use Plastilina to design parts of the model that need to look as natural as possible. For example, you can use Plastilina to create parts such as teeth, eyes, and tongue so that your animation characters don’t contain any distortions.</p>

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

<h3 id="02Van-Aken-2"><a href="#02Van-Aken-2" class="headerlink" title="02Van Aken"></a>02Van Aken</h3><p>Van Aken is another popular clay brand that’s ideal for <strong>claymation animations</strong>.

This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="05Plastilina-2"><a href="#05Plastilina-2" class="headerlink" title="05Plastilina"></a>05Plastilina</h3><p>Finally, Plastilina is also a great option for <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> models.

<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.)

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX"><a href="#05IKMAX" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>

This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-2"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-2" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX-2"><a href="#05IKMAX-2" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-3"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-3"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-3" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>

<p>All you need to do is open the clip, mark the In and Out points, adjust their sequence with previous or next edits in your cue and that’s it. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for this purpose. However, you need to preset these shortcuts before you begin editing your clips.</p>

To remove any unwanted portions of your edits, crop them in adobe Premiere Pro with your desired aspect ratio to give that ‘just perfect’ look to your edits.</p>
<p>Start from importing and adding your footage to your project panel, followed by creating a fresh composition. Now, choose ‘Crop’ from the Effects panel to add it to your clip, either by double-clicking or dragging and dropping.</p>

<p>All you need to do is open the clip, mark the In and Out points, adjust their sequence with previous or next edits in your cue and that’s it. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for this purpose. However, you need to preset these shortcuts before you begin editing your clips.</p>
