<p>02 [Step by Step to Help You Understand 2D&#x2F;3D Character Design](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Animate-Character-Design"><a href="#01Animate-Character-Design" class="headerlink" title="01Animate Character Design"></a>01Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are some steps involved in the designing a character for animation.

<h3 id="02Understanding-your-audience"><a href="#02Understanding-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="02Understanding your audience"></a>02Understanding your audience</h3><p>To create the best character design, it is essential that you understand your target audience. If your target audience includes the kids and the children, your character design will primarily be based on cartoons.</p>
<p>Ensure which genre of animation does your audience prefer? If it is funny or mythological or any other genre, you design your characters accordingly.</p>

Different types serve different purposes and genres. So, let us know about the different types of animations, and this will help you understand which one would suit your requirements.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Pop-style Characters</strong></p>
<p>The characters you see in the comics and superhero animation movies are pop-style characters. They are highly expressive, become the centre of attraction and always are dominant on the screen. They tend to deliver an energy that reaches the audience impeccably.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="pop style character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Iconic design</strong></p>
<p>These characters are less fancy but highly expressive. They usually have a block face yet connect to an audience of all types. They are generally best for the corporate videos and those with some messages to be delivered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iconic design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Editorial Style Characters</strong></p>
<p>These characters are highly elegant and bold. These are characters that we see in different publications. They consist of great style, realisticity and cleanliness. They are mainly used to express the quality of presence.</p>

                      alt="editorial design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sketch and experiment</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know about the different character types, it will help you understand which one would match the genre of animation you prefer to work on. So, start sketching your imagination in a draft.</p>
<p>Decide on the different poses your character might have. Track them down in a draft. It helps you become organised and put down your plan and creativity collectively.</p>
<p>Trial and error are one of the best ways to achieve perfection. So, it is crucial to sketch and then take feedback. If they do not appear praiseworthy, continue sketching and then get feedback again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animate and execute</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be best to execute all your drafts and imaginations. Try using the animation tools that suit your skill capacity and genre of animation the best.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Character-Design"><a href="#04Animate-Character-Design" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Character Design"></a>04Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are five simple steps that will help you animate a character design in 3D. The steps are as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>

                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

                      alt="editorial design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sketch and experiment</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know about the different character types, it will help you understand which one would match the genre of animation you prefer to work on. So, start sketching your imagination in a draft.</p>
<p>Decide on the different poses your character might have. Track them down in a draft. It helps you become organised and put down your plan and creativity collectively.</p>
<p>Trial and error are one of the best ways to achieve perfection. So, it is crucial to sketch and then take feedback. If they do not appear praiseworthy, continue sketching and then get feedback again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animate and execute</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be best to execute all your drafts and imaginations. Try using the animation tools that suit your skill capacity and genre of animation the best.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Character-Design-1"><a href="#04Animate-Character-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Character Design"></a>04Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are five simple steps that will help you animate a character design in 3D. The steps are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Contrivance the ideas</strong></p>

There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>

<p>Our list of the top 8 beats places to download <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>. You may get a lot of <strong>GIF libraries free</strong> by visiting these websites. These websites allow animated GIFs for various purposes, including personal, educational, and commercial ones. You can use the GIFs you download on your websites, blogs, presentations, and emails, among other things. The most excellent part about most of these websites is that you don’t have to pay anything or give them credit in exchange for royalty-free GIFs. These websites include trendy and attractive GIFs, while others only have older royalty-free GIFs. The GIFs on these websites are similarly free of any watermark.</p>
<p>There are numerous websites to download <strong>royalty GIFs</strong> with stock sound effects and photographs. However, when it comes to <strong>copyright-free GIFs</strong>, only a few websites offer them up for download. So, after spending a much time on the internet, I’ve found five websites that can assist you in doing the same. Two of the websites, “Best Animations” and “Animate It,” only enable you to use the GIFs you download for personal use.</p>

Given the preceding, commercial companies’ use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.</p>
<p>The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, “Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are “stolen” from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?</strong></h2><p>All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not <strong>copyright-free GIFs.</strong> However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.

<p>Our list of the top 8 beats places to download <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>. You may get a lot of <strong>GIF libraries free</strong> by visiting these websites. These websites allow animated GIFs for various purposes, including personal, educational, and commercial ones. You can use the GIFs you download on your websites, blogs, presentations, and emails, among other things. The most excellent part about most of these websites is that you don’t have to pay anything or give them credit in exchange for royalty-free GIFs. These websites include trendy and attractive GIFs, while others only have older royalty-free GIFs. The GIFs on these websites are similarly free of any watermark.</p>
<p>There are numerous websites to download <strong>royalty GIFs</strong> with stock sound effects and photographs. However, when it comes to <strong>copyright-free GIFs</strong>, only a few websites offer them up for download. So, after spending a much time on the internet, I’ve found five websites that can assist you in doing the same. Two of the websites, “Best Animations” and “Animate It,” only enable you to use the GIFs you download for personal use.</p>

Given the preceding, commercial companies’ use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.</p>
<p>The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, “Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are “stolen” from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use-1"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?</strong></h2><p>All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not <strong>copyright-free GIFs.</strong> However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.

A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, “Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are “stolen” from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)</p>

<p>Our list of the top 8 beats places to download <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>. You may get a lot of <strong>GIF libraries free</strong> by visiting these websites. These websites allow animated GIFs for various purposes, including personal, educational, and commercial ones. You can use the GIFs you download on your websites, blogs, presentations, and emails, among other things. The most excellent part about most of these websites is that you don’t have to pay anything or give them credit in exchange for royalty-free GIFs. These websites include trendy and attractive GIFs, while others only have older royalty-free GIFs. The GIFs on these websites are similarly free of any watermark.</p>
<p>There are numerous websites to download <strong>royalty GIFs</strong> with stock sound effects and photographs. However, when it comes to <strong>copyright-free GIFs</strong>, only a few websites offer them up for download. So, after spending a much time on the internet, I’ve found five websites that can assist you in doing the same. Two of the websites, “Best Animations” and “Animate It,” only enable you to use the GIFs you download for personal use.</p>

<p>If you want, you can readily import images, GIFs, videos, music, and other media files on Filmora.

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-24"><a href="#In-this-article-24" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [6 Animated Powerpoint Templates with Interactive Features](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-6-Animated-PowerPoint-Templates-with-Interactive-Features"><a href="#Part-1-6-Animated-PowerPoint-Templates-with-Interactive-Features" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features"></a>Part 1 <strong>6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features</strong></h2><p>The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>
<h3 id="01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template"><a href="#01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template" class="headerlink" title="01Company Presentation PowerPoint Template"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm_campaign=elements_af_493214&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius&mp=Theme%20Junkie"><strong>Company Presentation PowerPoint Template</strong></a></h3><p>For the first of the <strong>Moving Animation PowerPoint</strong> templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Open Project.</strong></h3><p>First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Animation"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2. Add Animation."></a>02<strong>Step 2. Add Animation.</strong></h3><p>Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="03Step-3-Choose-Animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Choose-Animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Choose Animation."></a>03<strong>Step 3. Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Choose Motion Path Animation</strong></h3><p>In order to make <strong>motion animation in PowerPoint</strong>, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.</p>
<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

Adjust Animation.</strong></h3><p>With <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions"><a href="#01Transitions" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations"><a href="#02Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start"><a href="#03Animation-Start" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png"
                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay"><a href="#05Animation-Delay" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Delay"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Separate into Sections with Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add Animation - Emphasis"
                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Exit"
                ></p>
<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>

Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>
<p><img

<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-1"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-1"><a href="#01Transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-1"><a href="#02Animations-1" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-1"><a href="#03Animation-Start-1" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-1"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-1"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-1" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Delay"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-1"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-1" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-1"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-1" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-1"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-1" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-1"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-1" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-1"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-1" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Open Project.</strong></h3><p>First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)</p>

Add Animation.</strong></h3><p>Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="03Step-3-Choose-Animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Choose-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Choose Animation."></a>03<strong>Step 3. Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Choose Motion Path Animation</strong></h3><p>In order to make <strong>motion animation in PowerPoint</strong>, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.</p>
<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-2"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-2"><a href="#01Transitions-2" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-2"><a href="#02Animations-2" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-2"><a href="#03Animation-Start-2" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-2"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-2" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-2"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-2" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Delay"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-2"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-2" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-2"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-2" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-2"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-2" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png"
                      alt="Add Animation - Emphasis"
                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-2"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-2" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-2"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-2" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>

It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Open Project.</strong></h3><p>First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)</p>

Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>

<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-3"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-3"><a href="#01Transitions-3" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-3"><a href="#02Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-3"><a href="#03Animation-Start-3" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-3"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-3" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-3"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-3" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-3"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-3" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-3"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-3" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-3"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-3" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-3"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-3" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-3"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-3" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>
