<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-8"><a href="#In-this-article-8" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below.

                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator"><a href="#01Add-the-animator" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG"
                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation"><a href="#03Create-an-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="delete keyframe unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum"><a href="#04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum" class="headerlink" title="04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum"></a>04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum</h3><p>With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG"
                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-9"><a href="#In-this-article-9" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>

<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-1"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-1" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-1"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-1" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-1"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation-1"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="unity animation"
                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-10"><a href="#In-this-article-10" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject"></a>02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject</h3><p>Now, you may have different subjects. We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-2"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-2" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-2"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-2" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>

<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-2"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>

Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="unity animation"
                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-11"><a href="#In-this-article-11" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG"
                      alt="delete animation folder unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject"></a>02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject</h3><p>Now, you may have different subjects. We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG"
                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-3"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-3" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-3"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-3" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-3"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> GIF makers cannot create animated GIFs, so it is impossible to utilize this tool.</p>
<p>How to Use this Online GIF Maker</p>
<p>Visit the GIF maker’s official homepage.</p>
<p>Step 1: Choose an image</p>
<p>Because it can also be helpful to create GIFs from photos, you may use the Load Image option to upload an image from your computer.</p>

Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.</p>

<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>

<p>Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.</p>

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>
