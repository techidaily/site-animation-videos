The profile owners typically upload their own images on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others at different times during the year or when anything significant happens.</p>
<p>Adding a photo gives your followers a chance to put a face to the name and an idea of what you look like. This allows them to better relate to you and creates a strong foundation for conversations and any other type of interactions.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works"><a href="#Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?"></a>Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?</h2><p>The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>

                      alt="Rig Mapping"
                ></p>
<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

<p>Mango animate character animation maker is an amazing software that can perform the task of animation in a very simple manner. We can rightfully comment that the software does make the job of animators rather simple. The rigging animation software automatically generates an energetic skeletal figure of the static character image. Using this skeleton, the software helps you to animate the character.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works-3"><a href="#Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?"></a>Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?</h2><p>The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>

                      alt="Rig Mapping"
                ></p>
<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

<p>GIFs add fun and humor to interactions via text messages. GIFs allow you to convey ideas, emotions, and thoughts in much more precise ways than an emoji would. iPhones operating on iOS 10 or later versions have an in-built GIF keyboard, making it super easy to add GIFs. iPhone text GIFs are readily accessible from GIF keyboards. Still, if you do not have one, you can resort to third-party applications like GIPHY and GIF keyboard for more prominent access to GIF libraries.</p>

If your iPhone belongs to this category, follow the simple steps to add <strong>GIFs in text messages on iPhone</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard"><a href="#01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard"></a>01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard</h3><p>Here’s how you can send <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> using the iOS default keyboard:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-3.jpg"
                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-5.jpg"
                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-6.jpg"
                      alt="select your desired GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Send icon, represented as a blue arrow icon, to send your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-7.jpg"
                      alt="hit send"
                ></p>
<p>You can add comments to a GIF just before sending it on the iMessage app. Type a message under the GIF before clicking “Send” to get the comment delivered together with the GIF.</p>
<p>From these simple steps, you can tell that sending a GIF from an iOS default keyboard is straightforward.</p>

GIFs allow you to convey ideas, emotions, and thoughts in much more precise ways than an emoji would. iPhones operating on iOS 10 or later versions have an in-built GIF keyboard, making it super easy to add GIFs. iPhone text GIFs are readily accessible from GIF keyboards.

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Hence, we dedicated this part to teaching you how to use <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> to revitalize and better express yourself while texting.</p>
<p>On iPhone, there are two different ways to send iPhone text GIFs – employing the default keyboard or through the help of third-party apps. You can use the iOS default keyboard to search for GIFs in iMessage on iPhones directly. This applies to all iPhones running on iOS 10 and later versions. If your iPhone belongs to this category, follow the simple steps to add <strong>GIFs in text messages on iPhone</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard-2"><a href="#01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard-2" class="headerlink" title="01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard"></a>01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard</h3><p>Here’s how you can send <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> using the iOS default keyboard:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-3.jpg"
                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-5.jpg"
                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-6.jpg"
                      alt="select your desired GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Send icon, represented as a blue arrow icon, to send your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hit send"
                ></p>
<p>You can add comments to a GIF just before sending it on the iMessage app. Type a message under the GIF before clicking “Send” to get the comment delivered together with the GIF.</p>

Hence, we dedicated this part to teaching you how to use <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> to revitalize and better express yourself while texting.</p>
<p>On iPhone, there are two different ways to send iPhone text GIFs – employing the default keyboard or through the help of third-party apps. You can use the iOS default keyboard to search for GIFs in iMessage on iPhones directly. This applies to all iPhones running on iOS 10 and later versions. If your iPhone belongs to this category, follow the simple steps to add <strong>GIFs in text messages on iPhone</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard-3"><a href="#01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard-3" class="headerlink" title="01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard"></a>01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard</h3><p>Here’s how you can send <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> using the iOS default keyboard:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-3.jpg"
                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-5.jpg"
                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-6.jpg"
                      alt="select your desired GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Send icon, represented as a blue arrow icon, to send your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-7.jpg"
                      alt="hit send"
                ></p>
<p>You can add comments to a GIF just before sending it on the iMessage app. Type a message under the GIF before clicking “Send” to get the comment delivered together with the GIF.</p>
<p>From these simple steps, you can tell that sending a GIF from an iOS default keyboard is straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Search for your desired GIF on GIPHY or other GIF websites.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Long press on the GIF, and from the pop-up options, click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch Messages, click the Write icon and enter the person’s contact details you want to text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-13.jpg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Click on the text box to bring up your iOS keyboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-14.jpg"
                      alt="click on the text box"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click on the text box again to add the paste option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-15.jpg"
                      alt="click again to bring up the paste option "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: When the GIF appears, click Paste.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-16.jpg"
                      alt="click paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: A preview of the GIF would appear on the text box. Hit Send when you’re ready to send the GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-17.jpg"
                      alt="tap send"
                ></p>
<p>If you use a GIF website other than GIPHY, the sent GIF may appear as a link rather than an image. If you’re okay with that, make sure the address of the shared animated image you end with the file extension, “.gif” if not, iMessage would not be able to load it.</p>
