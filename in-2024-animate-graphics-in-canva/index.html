<p>Canva is a graphic design platform that allows users to create stunning designs for social media posts, presentations, assignments, recipe cards, birthday videos.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Canva’s animation feature, a whole new world of possibilities are open to the public. Also, with pre-designed templates from professional designers, content creation has never been easier than Canva.</p>
<p>Animations themselves have the option of being individually customized element by element. Canva animated graphics makes it easy to unleash your creative potential.</p>
<p>This article will explore how to animate graphics in Canva that can suit every occasion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Animate Your Graphic In Canva](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Make A Moving Graphic In Canva](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [Pricing for Canva You Should Know](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva</h2><p>People can create animations in Canva in one of two ways. You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>
<p>● A4 Documents</p>
<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>
<p>● YouTube Thumbnails</p>
<p>● Presentation</p>
<p>● Flyer&#x2F;Poster</p>
<p>● Instagram Logo</p>
<p>● Infographic</p>
<p>These options generate the ability to be presented in both portrait and landscape mode. The multitude of options makes it an ideal medium for you to create your animation. The animation options at Canva also come with the opportunity to animate an existing image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-1.png"
                      alt="Free Animated Presentation"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>

You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>

<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>
<p>● YouTube Thumbnails</p>
<p>● Presentation</p>

<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>

These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>

You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 04"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

                ></p>
<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>
