Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-10-Photo-Animator-Templates-to-Bring-Your-Images-to-Life"><a href="#02Best-10-Photo-Animator-Templates-to-Bring-Your-Images-to-Life" class="headerlink" title="02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life"></a>02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life</h3><p><strong>3D motion photo animator</strong></p>
<p>The first tool on the list of <strong>3d photo animators online</strong>is an excellent tool called 3D motion photo Animator. The tool helps to split landscape shots into numerous panels depending on the distance of the object from the camera. Furthermore, the plug-in also adds a soft parallax movement into the layers, giving the final image a beautiful 3D effect. The tool also has several editing options and a wide range of lens flare. The animator tool allows you to tweak the weather by using the weather effect options available in the tool.</p>
<p><strong>3D photo animator</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>3d animation photo maker online</strong> takes the hype of the parallax effect in animation to a whole different level. The animator allows you to add parallax effects to any still image to make it appear 3 dimensional. Moreover, you can also add depth to the animated image to enhance the 3 dimensional effects and make it appear more realistic.</p>
<p><strong>Live photo animation</strong></p>
<p>Live photo animation is another seamless tool that offers <strong>free 3d motion graphics</strong>. The tool which is mainly meant for animation gives you the ability to mask the object and a keyframe from vivid natural movements. Once the subject and the background have been isolated and processed, they work independently from each other. This means that, due to independent operation, live photo animation becomes even more realistic since the subject can be animated without affecting the background. The tool also has cool zooming and 3D tracking effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

We are all set to take you through a ride of different animation styles, their importance, and some of the videos that one should give a try!</p>
<h4 id="1-2D-Animation"><a href="#1-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="1.  2D Animation"></a>1.  2D Animation</h4><p>Let’s start with 2D as our fist animation style, which is the traditional or oldest form in practice for more than 100 years since 1908. 2D has widely been in usage to create animated short films, cartoon characters, games, marketing videos, and educational materials. In 2D animation, the characters or items, creatures, and backgrounds get crafted in a two-dimensional space. It produces a graphic of movement with the drawings played serially one after another.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: At present, various free animator tools like Creatoon, Blender, and Pencil 2D, whereas, for professionals, Encore, Flash, Toon Boom Harmony, and Adobe Photoshop can be handy!</p>
<p>The above 2D animation style video is a short film “Dark Dark Woods” directed by the students at “The Animation Workshop.” It is all about the young princess, Maria, drenched, and tired of living a royal life being filled with rules, duties, lessons, responsibilities, and customs. One night, she enters into an adventurous event where she finds herself in a mysterious monster-filled dark wood. Watch the film and find did she find out there!</p>
<h4 id="2-3D-Animation"><a href="#2-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="2.  3D Animation"></a>2.  3D Animation</h4><p>As the next version of 2D, in the animation industry, 3D revolutionized the market since its first appearance in 1972. Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.</p>
<p>Do you know how it feels if you are trapped alone on a deserted island? “It’s a Cinch!” is a fantastic, funny 3D short film that is an adventurous movie made by the ESMA team at CGI. For sure, you will like this funny movie all about atrocities happening with a man and a pelican and enjoy it as much as I did!</p>
<h4 id="3-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#3-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="3.  Motion Graphics"></a>3.  Motion Graphics</h4><p>Our next animation style is motion graphics of the animated graphic design, where text appears to be the main enhancing factor. It is a piece of animation or digital footage that illuminates a motion or notation incorporated with audio. It is a new way of communicating to the audience and in driving them deep into the story. You can categorize it under the visual effect technique, which involves the movement of graphic images or elements like logos or text, sound, music, and motion. Motion graphics are best to be found in action and finds a place in multimedia projects, advertising agencies, branding, television title making, and storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: Tools that are best for motion graphics is Mocha AE, After Effects, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D.</p>
<p>The world is a great place, but we always forget another beautiful hidden green world behind the fantastic buildings we reside in. Yes, “Beautiful World” is a motion graphic video by Blasterjaxx &amp; DBSTF feat. Ryder presents how we humans have developed a great empire by destroying the other beautiful part of the world.</p>
<h4 id="4-Stop-Motion"><a href="#4-Stop-Motion" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stop Motion"></a>4.  Stop Motion</h4><p>Stop motion is one of the traditional animation styles that is the most popular filmmaking technique that uses hand-crafted or manipulated objects, mostly clay models. Puppets, silhouettes, and cut-outs can also be implemented as stop motion aids to produce animation. It is labor-intensive, a form of art, and has its flavor in animation, although 3D and visual effects have replaced it quite a long time before. But still, filmmakers like Tim Burton use stop motion in their films, making it to withstand the animation industry.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: You can make your stop motion video with software like Dragon frame, Stop Motion Pro Eclipse, and IKITMovie.</p>
<p>Although stop motion has gone before ages, there is still a fantastic introduction. Here is an award-winning short film, “Tokri (the basket),” which is a clumsy accident that leads a juvenile girl onto Mumbai’s streets with the trust of making things correct. Studio Eeksaurus, an Indian bastion animation company, has depicted a father and daughter’s tender emotive tale.</p>
<h4 id="5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation"><a href="#5-Paint-On-Glass-Animation" class="headerlink" title="5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation"></a>5.  Paint-On-Glass Animation</h4><p>Here is a Paint-on-Glass animation style that is a technique used for making animated films that gives a lot of fun. Artists paint short stories on glasses using oil paints and film them by recording it frame-by-frame. Russian animator Aleksandr Petrov is a famous artist well known for making award-winning paint-on-glass animation. Animators use different objects like brick dust, sand, pastels, and charcoal, to create outstanding drama in their films.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: You can also become a paint-on-glass animator now with tools like Pencil 2D, Blender, Krita, and GIMP.</p>
<p>Suppose you are wondering whether you could find any paint-on-glass animated movie on social media sites. In that case, there are numerous animated films, like “The Old Man and the Sea,” and “My Love,” produced by the experts of pictures of Aleksandr Petrov animation. Surprisingly, this bind-blowing introduction is a result of oil paints on a sheet of glass.</p>

<p><strong>● Renderforest</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 key features are:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Amazing logo fonts</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Wide variety of logo styles</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Amazing layout designs</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Logos can be created on the cloud with built-in tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Logo can be edited anytime without any hassle</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> Renderforest rating is 10 out of 10</p>
<p><strong>Review</strong>: I found Renderforest to be very fast and effective in making an animated logo. The amazing logo fonts are available with the vast logo style library.

<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>

For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel &gt; Speech page for the option to apply it there.</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier"><a href="#01Flixier" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Flixier Online Video Editor"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord"><a href="#02Woord" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Speechelo"><a href="#03Speechelo" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A wide variety of voice options to choose from.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05TTS-Reader"><a href="#05TTS-Reader" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available to use online for FREE.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable speed for voice.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-8"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-8" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it’s important that you’re aware of all the different options out there!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you’ll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, you’ll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.</p>

<h3 id="01Flixier-1"><a href="#01Flixier-1" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>

However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>

It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>

Starting with:</p>
<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-2"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-2" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-2"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-2" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube"></a>Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube</h2><p>If you want to create your own <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-2"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-2" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Most-Realistic-Sounding-Text-to-Speech-How-to-Do-It-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Most-Realistic-Sounding-Text-to-Speech-How-to-Do-It-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech &amp; How to Do It?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech &amp; How to Do It?</strong></h2><p>To start off, we’ve included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:</p>
<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-3"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-3" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-3"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-3" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube"></a>Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube</h2><p>If you want to create your own <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Reading Speed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-3"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-3" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel &gt; Speech page for the option to apply it there.</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier-3"><a href="#01Flixier-3" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>

                      alt="Flixier Online Video Editor"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord-3"><a href="#02Woord-3" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

<h3 id="03Speechelo-3"><a href="#03Speechelo-3" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="1-Pinterest"><a href="#1-Pinterest" class="headerlink" title="1. Pinterest"></a>1. Pinterest</h3><p>Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.</p>
<p>Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.</p>
