<p>You will not regret your decision after reading this article and will find that using Adobe Animate CC is a wise choice. Hence, let’s begin to get enlightened on the features.</p>
<h2 id="New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC"><a href="#New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC" class="headerlink" title="New features of Adobe Animate CC"></a>New features of Adobe Animate CC</h2><h4 id="1-Adobe-Animate-Camera"><a href="#1-Adobe-Animate-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1. Adobe Animate Camera"></a>1. Adobe Animate Camera</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC introduces virtual camera functionality unlike other <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of this feature, you can easily stimulate your camera’s movement giving your animation a more realistic view.</p>
<p>Making it simpler, you can effortlessly execute panning, zooming and rotating to your animations if you wish. Using the virtual camera in Animate CC, you will be enabling to add more dramatic effects while creating an animation.</p>
<p>For instance, if there’s a fighting scene in our animated movie, you can rotate at the moment the scene shows destruction to give it a dramatic effect or you can zoom in or out and change the viewer’s attention from one point to the other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-camera.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc camera"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Export-format"><a href="#2-Export-format" class="headerlink" title="2. Export format"></a>2. Export format</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC has adapted the web standards for the exporting your animation which makes it easier for everyone to view it from desktop to mobile device.</p>
<p>This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.</p>
<p>Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-export-format.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc export format"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Vector-brushes"><a href="#3-Vector-brushes" class="headerlink" title="3. Vector brushes"></a>3. Vector brushes</h4><p>Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.</p>
<p>This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-vector-brush.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc vector brush"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Audio-Syncing"><a href="#4-Audio-Syncing" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Syncing"></a>4. Audio Syncing</h4><p>The timeline feature of the tool will now allow the users to sync audios in their animations and this is a yet another feature that Animate CC has added. This means you can do audio synchronization for your animation series.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-audio-syncing.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc audio syncing"
                ></p>
<p>Nevertheless, doing this can be a little demanding as well as time-consuming with HTML5 alone. In addition, you also get enabled for audio loop control with the Adobe Animate CC’s timeline feature.</p>
<h4 id="5-Font"><a href="#5-Font" class="headerlink" title="5. Font"></a>5. Font</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts. These web fonts will be present for HTML5 canvas documents in the tool. Users can pick out from thousands of high-quality fonts via a subscription plan.</p>
<p>Putting in different words, first you can try some selected fonts available in the Typekit library via any level of Creative Cloud plan. Then when you subscribe by spending some money, you can then get access to complete Typekit library where there are thousands of premium fonts for HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-font.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc font"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Animation industry is no doubt a very interesting one and having the best tool can make it more interesting and fun. After making you familiarize with the top functionalities that are coming with Adobe Animate CC, we feel it would be fair to end the discussion here. Hope you will not give a second thought on Animate CC when need to do flash animation.</p>
<p>Before ending, one more thing that we would like to give the other thought by introducing you Filmora.</p>
<p>No, this is a not another feature, but an interesting yet powerful video editing software created by Wondershare, one of the leading brand in multimedia field. You can use this tool and get your animated videos edited using its extraordinary effects.</p>

<h2 id="New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC-3"><a href="#New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC-3" class="headerlink" title="New features of Adobe Animate CC"></a>New features of Adobe Animate CC</h2><h4 id="1-Adobe-Animate-Camera-3"><a href="#1-Adobe-Animate-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Adobe Animate Camera"></a>1. Adobe Animate Camera</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC introduces virtual camera functionality unlike other <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of this feature, you can easily stimulate your camera’s movement giving your animation a more realistic view.</p>
<p>Making it simpler, you can effortlessly execute panning, zooming and rotating to your animations if you wish. Using the virtual camera in Animate CC, you will be enabling to add more dramatic effects while creating an animation.</p>
<p>For instance, if there’s a fighting scene in our animated movie, you can rotate at the moment the scene shows destruction to give it a dramatic effect or you can zoom in or out and change the viewer’s attention from one point to the other.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-camera.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc camera"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Export-format-3"><a href="#2-Export-format-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Export format"></a>2. Export format</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC has adapted the web standards for the exporting your animation which makes it easier for everyone to view it from desktop to mobile device.</p>
<p>This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.</p>
<p>Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-export-format.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc export format"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Vector-brushes-3"><a href="#3-Vector-brushes-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Vector brushes"></a>3. Vector brushes</h4><p>Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.</p>
<p>This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-vector-brush.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc vector brush"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Audio-Syncing-3"><a href="#4-Audio-Syncing-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Syncing"></a>4. Audio Syncing</h4><p>The timeline feature of the tool will now allow the users to sync audios in their animations and this is a yet another feature that Animate CC has added. This means you can do audio synchronization for your animation series.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-audio-syncing.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc audio syncing"
                ></p>
<p>Nevertheless, doing this can be a little demanding as well as time-consuming with HTML5 alone. In addition, you also get enabled for audio loop control with the Adobe Animate CC’s timeline feature.</p>
<h4 id="5-Font-3"><a href="#5-Font-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Font"></a>5. Font</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts. These web fonts will be present for HTML5 canvas documents in the tool. Users can pick out from thousands of high-quality fonts via a subscription plan.</p>
<p>Putting in different words, first you can try some selected fonts available in the Typekit library via any level of Creative Cloud plan. Then when you subscribe by spending some money, you can then get access to complete Typekit library where there are thousands of premium fonts for HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-font.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc font"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Animation industry is no doubt a very interesting one and having the best tool can make it more interesting and fun. After making you familiarize with the top functionalities that are coming with Adobe Animate CC, we feel it would be fair to end the discussion here. Hope you will not give a second thought on Animate CC when need to do flash animation.</p>
<p>Before ending, one more thing that we would like to give the other thought by introducing you Filmora.</p>
<p>No, this is a not another feature, but an interesting yet powerful video editing software created by Wondershare, one of the leading brand in multimedia field. You can use this tool and get your animated videos edited using its extraordinary effects.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Choose the First Image</strong></p>
<p>Begin with selecting the first image for your slideshow, just as you would ideally do for a normal, single image Instagram feed and long press the same.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Confirming the Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the bottom right corner of your selected image to locate a button similar to a photo slideshow. Tap the button to see a ‘1’ inscribed in a blue circle appear on your chosen image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Make Further Selections</strong></p>
<p>You can now proceed to select other images or videos for the slideshow, in a similar fashion as the first one. You are allowed to include a maximum of 10 media files within the slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>Tap the ‘Next’ button when you have finished making the required selections. The editor interface will now open to let you customize the selected images with a series of effects and filters, both one at a time, as well as the entire set altogether.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animated Text Overlays</strong></p>
<p>If your Instagram story slideshows are missing out on the visual spunk, try complimenting their images and videos with animated transitions and text overlays. Short and quick animations are the best ways to enhance a slideshow story with an eye catching effect. Applying a variety of text overlays would help to keep the audience curious about the next visual delight.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer a Vertical Aspect Ratio</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>

<p>Some tips you can keep in mind while creating logo are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be specific to your brand. Be sure that you are not choosing a logo that may deviate customers from your brand perspective.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Always choose colors in contrast because a single color logo does not seem to be appealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure to choose a template that is easy to understand. If the template seems to be difficult to understand, a user will not be able to get it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

<h3 id="3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan"><a href="#3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan" class="headerlink" title="3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)"></a>3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-1"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-2"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-3"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

<h3 id="3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan-3"><a href="#3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)"></a>3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

<h3 id="4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China-3"><a href="#4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Death Note (Banned in China)"></a>4. Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>
