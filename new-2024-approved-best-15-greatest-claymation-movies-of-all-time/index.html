<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies. Although, DC remains the king regards to animated movies. DC animated movies are better coordinated with live-action scenes. Each story features different aspects of Gotham city and its issues.</p>
<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.</p>

<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies. Although, DC remains the king regards to animated movies. DC animated movies are better coordinated with live-action scenes. Each story features different aspects of Gotham city and its issues.</p>
<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.</p>

<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies.

<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.</p>

<h3 id="3-GIPHY-3"><a href="#3-GIPHY-3" class="headerlink" title="3. GIPHY"></a>3. GIPHY</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Make A GIF allows you to create a GIF from many images, a video from your computer, a Facebook or YouTube video, or directly from your webcam.</p>
<p>With this tool, it’s pretty simple to customize the order of the photos and rearrange them via drag-and-drop editor. You can also resize its images and create a personalized animation speed. In addition, there is a captioning tool included to add text on top of your GIF, but you can’t preview it before creating the GIF or change where the text GIF maker is displayed.</p>
<p>You can save the GIF to your PC and copy its URL to find it online once created. It further consists of options for making your GIF public, private, or unlisted. You can even link directly to the GIF file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>ImgFlip displays a preview of your GIF during the creation, which is valuable. You can develop these GIFs from images, a GIF URL, a video URL, or a video you upload yourself.</p>
<p>Besides, you can alter animation delay, width, height, photo order, and quality for a GIF created with images. There’s also a crop option, text tool, and the ability to rotate the GIF, change the play count, reverse it, and change the background color.</p>
<p>You can download your GIF and share it over a few social media sites once done, or not post it online while setting it as private.</p>
<p>A watermark displayed on all GIFs created is here at Imgflip. Also, most of the custom settings for making a GIF from this GIF text generator are usable only if you subscribe to ImgFlip Pro.</p>
