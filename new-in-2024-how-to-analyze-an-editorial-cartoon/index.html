<p><strong>What’s new with Adobe Animate?</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Web Fonts</strong></p>
<p>Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.</p>

How Much Do You Know About Adobe Animate Key Features?</h3><p>The Adobe Creative Cloud is constantly updating its range of virtual tools with new features which give users twice more incentive to subscribe. Adobe Animate CC, which is basically the new Adobe Flash, has also received an update recently which installed a bundle of new features to its interface, making it even more irresistible to animators.</p>
<p><strong>What’s new with Adobe Animate?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Adobe Animate Camera</strong></p>
<p>Adding to Adobe’s line of exclusivity is its all-new Adobe Virtual Camera. Using this feature, Adobe animate users can now control their animation camera movements giving your animation videos a more realistic feel.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Export any Format</strong></p>
<p>Exporting your animations to your desktop is a convenience every software should provide.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Audio Syncing</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Animate enables you to synchronize audio to your animations completely easily which is yet another feature that has been recently added.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Vector Brushes</strong></p>
<p>Though it resembles the same functionality with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate has renewed the tool with the ability to use tilt and pressure effects when drawing with a stylus or pen.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Web Fonts</strong></p>
<p>Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.</p>

<p>This becomes an obstacle to those who are just starting out and are not that confident in getting their hands on a professional league interface like Animate. It also lacks sufficient facilities for practicing 3D animations.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works"><a href="#Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?"></a>Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?</h2><p>The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>

                      alt="Rig Mapping"
                ></p>
<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

                ></p>
<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

<p>In the recent few years, videos have become the primary tool for marketers to attract their target customers. Unlike banners and pamphlets, videos are relatively more engaging and make it easier for marketers to establish a connection with the viewers. Now, each brand has different preferences when it comes to choosing the right video marketing strategy.</p>
<p>While some brands opt for conventional video advertisements, others get a bit creative and introduce <strong>graphics animation</strong> to their videos to make them more captivating. Of course, if you want to maximize the user’s attention and retain more customers, you would prefer the latter. Animated videos are more engaging and also sets the brand apart from the rest of the crowd.</p>

The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.</p>
<p>However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why <strong>graphics and animations</strong> should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.</p>
<p>Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Motion-Graphics-and-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Motion-Graphics-and-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What’s the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?"></a>Part 2 What’s the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?</h2><p>Now, whenever we talk about <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.</p>
<h3 id="01Motion-Graphics"><a href="#01Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="01Motion Graphics"></a>01Motion Graphics</h3><p><img

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.</p>
<h3 id="02Animations"><a href="#02Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02Animations</h3><p>Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of <strong>graphics animations.</strong> However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text&#x2F;objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.</p>
<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.</p>

Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="01Start-With-a-Template"><a href="#01Start-With-a-Template" class="headerlink" title="01Start With a Template"></a>01Start With a Template</h3><p>Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.</p>
<p>Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.</p>

<h3 id="02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding"><a href="#02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="02Be Subtle With Personal Branding"></a>02Be Subtle With Personal Branding</h3><p>Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your <strong>motion graphics animation.</strong></p>

Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.</p>

<h3 id="04Design-Multiple-Variations"><a href="#04Design-Multiple-Variations" class="headerlink" title="04Design Multiple Variations"></a>04Design Multiple Variations</h3><p>It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A&#x2F;B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.</p>
<h3 id="05Use-GIF-Format"><a href="#05Use-GIF-Format" class="headerlink" title="05Use GIF Format"></a>05Use GIF Format</h3><p>Finally, once your <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.</p>

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>

<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.</p>

They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.</p>
<p>Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.</p>

While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.</p>
<h3 id="01Motion-Graphics-3"><a href="#01Motion-Graphics-3" class="headerlink" title="01Motion Graphics"></a>01Motion Graphics</h3><p><img

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.</p>
<h3 id="02Animations-3"><a href="#02Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02Animations</h3><p>Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of <strong>graphics animations.</strong> However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text&#x2F;objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.</p>
<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Graphic-Design-Techniques-for-Motion-Graphics-3"><a href="#Part-3-5-Graphic-Design-Techniques-for-Motion-Graphics-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics"></a>Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics</h2><p>So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="01Start-With-a-Template-3"><a href="#01Start-With-a-Template-3" class="headerlink" title="01Start With a Template"></a>01Start With a Template</h3><p>Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.</p>
<p>Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.</p>

<h3 id="02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding-3"><a href="#02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding-3" class="headerlink" title="02Be Subtle With Personal Branding"></a>02Be Subtle With Personal Branding</h3><p>Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your <strong>motion graphics animation.</strong></p>

Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="04Design-Multiple-Variations-3"><a href="#04Design-Multiple-Variations-3" class="headerlink" title="04Design Multiple Variations"></a>04Design Multiple Variations</h3><p>It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A&#x2F;B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.</p>
<h3 id="05Use-GIF-Format-3"><a href="#05Use-GIF-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="05Use GIF Format"></a>05Use GIF Format</h3><p>Finally, once your <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.</p>
