The basics of animation were formulated in the 2000s from the moving page trick. The first few animators learned that animation is nothing but continuous switching of frames from one to another. One animated still is switched to another and then another in a quick sequence such that it makes a sequential moving frame. Today, animation has come a long way from where it started and today it is used for several commercials, tutorials, and even educational lecture videos. Pencil2D animation is an amazing animation tool that can be used by even neophytes. Want to learn more about 2d pencil animation and its super cool features? Well, you’re at the perfect place.

Follow the steps listed below in order to learn how to animate through pencil 2d to make your first animation.</p>
<h3 id="1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame"><a href="#1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure that you’ve turned on your bitmap on the first frame"></a>1. Ensure that you’ve turned on your bitmap on the first frame</h3><p>Animation works through quick switching of frame which makes it appear as though the object is in motion. By turning on the bitmap, pencil 2d animation ensures that you’ve no blank frames at the start of your animation.</p>

<h3 id="2-Draw-your-animated-character"><a href="#2-Draw-your-animated-character" class="headerlink" title="2. Draw your animated character"></a>2. Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

<h3 id="3-The-three-circular-buttons"><a href="#3-The-three-circular-buttons" class="headerlink" title="3.The three circular buttons"></a>3.The three circular buttons</h3><p>Once you’re satisfied with the character you draw, you need to spot the 3 circular buttons which are arranged in the “+”,”-“,”+” order. By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

<h3 id="4-Repeat-until-you-get-an-animation"><a href="#4-Repeat-until-you-get-an-animation" class="headerlink" title="4.Repeat until you get an animation"></a>4.Repeat until you get an animation</h3><p>Now that you know how to deal with multiple frames, you can continue creating frames and making the animated characters move by tweaking with the drawing in every frame. For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Write a script, whether it is a short script or a regular video. The whiteboard animation video might not succeed with exciting information and images and no coherent story.

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-10-Photo-Animator-Templates-to-Bring-Your-Images-to-Life"><a href="#02Best-10-Photo-Animator-Templates-to-Bring-Your-Images-to-Life" class="headerlink" title="02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life"></a>02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life</h3><p><strong>3D motion photo animator</strong></p>
<p>The first tool on the list of <strong>3d photo animators online</strong>is an excellent tool called 3D motion photo Animator. The tool helps to split landscape shots into numerous panels depending on the distance of the object from the camera. Furthermore, the plug-in also adds a soft parallax movement into the layers, giving the final image a beautiful 3D effect. The tool also has several editing options and a wide range of lens flare. The animator tool allows you to tweak the weather by using the weather effect options available in the tool.</p>
<p><strong>3D photo animator</strong></p>
<p>This <strong>3d animation photo maker online</strong> takes the hype of the parallax effect in animation to a whole different level. The animator allows you to add parallax effects to any still image to make it appear 3 dimensional. Moreover, you can also add depth to the animated image to enhance the 3 dimensional effects and make it appear more realistic.</p>
<p><strong>Live photo animation</strong></p>
<p>Live photo animation is another seamless tool that offers <strong>free 3d motion graphics</strong>. The tool which is mainly meant for animation gives you the ability to mask the object and a keyframe from vivid natural movements. Once the subject and the background have been isolated and processed, they work independently from each other. This means that, due to independent operation, live photo animation becomes even more realistic since the subject can be animated without affecting the background. The tool also has cool zooming and 3D tracking effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now. People who use this application make a common mistake of using too many slides with huge amounts of text and that is a major turnoff for the audience. Huge text is seen as a disaster. You should be able to convey an interesting story to your attentive audience without explaining every single detail on your slides for your presentation. Using a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GIF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to explain complicate things or just set it as a background can be much interesting.</p>
