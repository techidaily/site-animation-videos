<p>When you are trying to make an <strong>aesthetic drawings cartoon</strong>, the primary thing to focus on is the composition. Composition is the combination, arrangement, and organization of objects within the borders of drawing space. To have a great aesthetic cartoon drawing, you must focus on bringing the eyes of the viewer toward your center of interest within an aesthetically-pleasing composition. When we create illustrations, we are often concerned with putting in a lot of details that will overload the image and lose the meaning that we originally wanted it to convey.</p>

<p>Rigging is a technology that is not known to everyone. However, an animation freak must know the technology in depth.</p>

<p>If you are an animator, you must be wondering how to implement rigging. Follow this tutorial and get a complete insight on the <strong>adobe animate rigging tutorial</strong>.</p>

<p>03 [Where to Rig and Animate More Characters?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works"><a href="#Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?"></a>Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?</h2><p>The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Rig Mapping"
                ></p>
<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.</p>
<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>
<p>The value you insert into the <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn’t let you minimize a project’s frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04.</p>
<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>

When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.</p>
<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>
<p>The value you insert into the <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn’t let you minimize a project’s frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04.</p>
<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>

<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>

<p>K24 Moscow is one of the most captivating websites built for a modern architectural project. The website recalls the spirit of Russian suprematism and avant-garde. Scroll-triggered animations are used to <strong>animate elements on scroll</strong> throughout the full presentation. With every new scroll, you will discover something new. The combination of white, black, and red color sections that move and overlap with changes in size make a distinct typeface. These combine to make it an exciting website while keeping the Russian avant-garde spirit.</p>

On the website at the very beginning, you will be greeted with an introductory graphic and then you will begin exploring the site. You will have the feeling like you have entered into a time capsule. You will be able to see the works month by month. And when you click on any particular project the picture will get displayed right on the center of the screen. With it, you will find relevant information underneath. The background color keeps changing while navigating through a 3D space.</p>
<h3 id="10Bewegen-3"><a href="#10Bewegen-3" class="headerlink" title="10Bewegen"></a>10Bewegen</h3><p><img

<p>The website of Bewegen is a showcase of animations, rich content, and interactions. Bewegen is a popular world-class system known for sharing bikes. The scroll-triggered animations along with the zoom shots give a detailed view of the popular Bewegen Pedelec bike. While one scroll down further one will get related information about the bike-sharing system and also get details on how to use it. There is also the option where anyone can create their sharing system just by choosing the city and the number of heads to be included in the project while choosing the color and other features of the bike.</p>
<h3 id="11Wtower-3"><a href="#11Wtower-3" class="headerlink" title="11Wtower"></a>11Wtower</h3><p><img

                      alt="Wtower"
                ></p>
<p>The website of Wtower is built to an interactive virtual world that tells the story of the world’s largest water tower in past - Ural’s White Tower. This website is another amazing storytelling website where the scroll-triggered animation fits like puzzle pieces. The scrolling takes to a 3D space where you will be able to learn how the tower originated and what the current state is in present. You will find a progress bar at the bottom and this appears every time there is some useful element to be delivered. Also, you can check how much of the story you have listened to and how much is left.</p>

                      alt="Parmigiani Fleurier"
                ></p>
<p>The website of Parmigiani Fleurier is a website for Swiss watchmakers. This website is also another amazing animate on scroll example. The layout of the website is elegant as well as demure. While one scroll one can explore the entire collection by using the rows used on both sides of the screen. After you find the model that attracts your eye, you can view the detailed information that shows in an asymmetrical pattern around the watch. You will also come to know about other details like the case, dial, strap, winding system, and other technical specifications. The animations used are very subtle and well-balanced.</p>
