<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>

                      alt="crop avatar"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: It’s time to be creative with the image now. You can remove background, erase or add text and even add a background that suits your avatar. The customization depends all on your requirement. This is it. Now, you need to know how you can get an animated avatar on Discord.</p>

<p>Step 1: To get an <strong>animated discord profile picture,</strong> you will need to have Nitro. Otherwise the profile picture won’t save as animated. Also, if you use PC for this, things will be better. Now, open the desktop version of Discord.</p>
<p>Step 2: Login to your account and go to User Settings by clicking the gear icon given next to your profile picture.</p>

                      alt="click user settings discord"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: In Settings, multiple options will be visible. You need to look for the “Discord Nitro” option. Clicking on this will lead you to Discord Nitro page.</p>
<p>Note: You need to click on “Subscribe” if you don’t have Discord Nitro.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="subscribe discord nitro"

<p>Step 4: Choose the plan once you subscribe. Hit on “Select” after choosing it.</p>

                      alt="select plan discord nitr"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Pay for it using the desired payment method. Enter your address and agree to the terms and conditions of Discord. After all the formalities are done, please click on “Sweet”. This will complete the subscription.</p>

                      alt="nitro activated"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Now, head to the GIF website like Tenor and choose the GIF that you like. Download it. You can right click on the GIF and click “Save Image as…” to get it.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="save gif"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: After saving the GIF, go to the Settings of your Discord account. Hit on “User Profile” followed by “Change Avatar”.</p>

                      alt="change avatar discord"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: The dialog box will open where you need to find the GIF you just saved. After finding the GIF, click on “Open”.</p>

                      alt="open gif"
                ></p>
<p>Note: You can take the animated avatar that you created yourself by using the steps in the previous part.</p>
<p>Step 9: Now, you will get to the Discord profile picture page. Here, you need to resize the GIF. Click on “Apply” when you are satisfied with the resizing or you can skip it too.</p>

<p>Some tips you can keep in mind while creating logo are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be specific to your brand. Be sure that you are not choosing a logo that may deviate customers from your brand perspective.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Always choose colors in contrast because a single color logo does not seem to be appealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure to choose a template that is easy to understand. If the template seems to be difficult to understand, a user will not be able to get it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>
