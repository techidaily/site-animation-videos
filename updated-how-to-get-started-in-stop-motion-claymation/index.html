Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

<h3 id="02Van-Aken"><a href="#02Van-Aken" class="headerlink" title="02Van Aken"></a>02Van Aken</h3><p>Van Aken is another popular clay brand that’s ideal for <strong>claymation animations</strong>.

Some animators also mix Van Aken with Pupper Putty to make the characters look more stunning under the perfect lighting conditions.</p>
<h3 id="03Sargent-Art"><a href="#03Sargent-Art" class="headerlink" title="03Sargent Art"></a>03Sargent Art</h3><p>Sargent Art is a brand that primarily designs clays for sculpting.

<h3 id="04Sculpey"><a href="#04Sculpey" class="headerlink" title="04Sculpey"></a>04Sculpey</h3><p>Sculpey is a clay brand that designs polymer-based clays that are relatively better than the traditional ceramic mud clays. This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="05Plastilina"><a href="#05Plastilina" class="headerlink" title="05Plastilina"></a>05Plastilina</h3><p>Finally, Plastilina is also a great option for <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> models.

<h2 id="Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone-3"><a href="#Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone"></a>Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone</h2><p>So, now that you are familiar with the basic concept of <strong>clay stop animation</strong>, let’s understand how you can get started with claymation animations. Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

So, the next part would be to turn these raw images into an animation. To do this, you can use different types of video editing applications. However, we recommend using Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.</p>

<p>It will be beneficial while knowing <strong>how to make 2D animation for games</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements"><a href="#01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements" class="headerlink" title="01Focus on the story and start with simple movements"></a>01Focus on the story and start with simple movements</h3><p>You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don’t miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.</p>
<h3 id="02Use-keyframes-properly"><a href="#02Use-keyframes-properly" class="headerlink" title="02Use keyframes properly"></a>02Use keyframes properly</h3><p>You need to carefully use keyframes’ start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements.

<h3 id="03Enliven-your-characters"><a href="#03Enliven-your-characters" class="headerlink" title="03Enliven your characters"></a>03Enliven your characters</h3><p>You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.</p>
<p>Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical <strong>2D</strong> <strong>game animation</strong> strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>

<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things.

This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>

                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-2"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-2" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>
<p>This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.</p>

<p>Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical <strong>2D</strong> <strong>game animation</strong> strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-3"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-3" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>

<h3 id="01Cropping-Clips"><a href="#01Cropping-Clips" class="headerlink" title="01Cropping Clips"></a>01Cropping Clips</h3><p>Cropping your videos allows you to fit them into your required size frames. To remove any unwanted portions of your edits, crop them in adobe Premiere Pro with your desired aspect ratio to give that ‘just perfect’ look to your edits.</p>
<p>Start from importing and adding your footage to your project panel, followed by creating a fresh composition. Now, choose ‘Crop’ from the Effects panel to add it to your clip, either by double-clicking or dragging and dropping.</p>
<h3 id="02Trimming-Clips"><a href="#02Trimming-Clips" class="headerlink" title="02Trimming Clips"></a>02Trimming Clips</h3><p>If you want to adjust the ‘In and Out’ play back sequence of your edited clips, you can go for trimming them. You can trim your clips in the Source and Program monitors, or even in the Premiere Pro timeline. You can choose from the standard cut, jump cut, B-roll cut etc, to suit your editing needs and styles.</p>
<p>All you need to do is open the clip, mark the In and Out points, adjust their sequence with previous or next edits in your cue and that’s it. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for this purpose. However, you need to preset these shortcuts before you begin editing your clips.</p>
<h3 id="03Adding-Text"><a href="#03Adding-Text" class="headerlink" title="03Adding Text"></a>03Adding Text</h3><p>You can try adding simple and formatted texts to enhance your video outlook. This comes handy when you are aiming to deliver specific messages to your audience. You can add normal write-ups, callout quotations and customize your text in a number of exciting styles. Just go to the Type tool, format your text in the Text Box and you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="04Audio-Level-Adjustment"><a href="#04Audio-Level-Adjustment" class="headerlink" title="04Audio Level Adjustment"></a>04Audio Level Adjustment</h3><p>Want to add spark to your clips with a synchronized audio visual effect? After you finish trimming and cropping, consider opting for an in-line audio adjustment. This will definitely enhance your video and take your craft to the next level.</p>
<p>All you need to do is select an audio clip, click on ‘Audio Gain’ in the drop down menu, set desired Decibel count in the Audio Gain Box and select ‘OK’.</p>
<h3 id="05Exporting-Videos"><a href="#05Exporting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="05Exporting Videos"></a>05Exporting Videos</h3><p>Once you are done with your video craft, you should certainly look forward to making it available for social exposure. To do this, select appropriate sequence constraints in the Export window, choose the export platform, format and Codec, make fine tuning and bit rate adjustments and finish export either in Premiere Pro or Media Encoder. You may also save these settings for your next exports.</p>

<h3 id="01Tales-from-the-Vienna-Woods"><a href="#01Tales-from-the-Vienna-Woods" class="headerlink" title="01Tales from the Vienna Woods"></a>01Tales from the Vienna Woods</h3><p>This was a masterpiece in the world of <strong>cartoon music</strong>, originally heard in the caricature series, A Corny Concerto in 1943, directed by Bob Clampett under the globally known Disney production house. The composition is essentially a repetition of Fantasia, which was released in 1940.</p>

<p>Concerning on the popularity of the music, the latter has received positive music reviews from almost all the leading media critic platforms.</p>
<h3 id="02The-Blue-Danube"><a href="#02The-Blue-Danube" class="headerlink" title="02The Blue Danube"></a>02The Blue Danube</h3><p>Again an inclusion of the 1943 release, A corny Concerto, this was predominantly a comic version of the original track. It was used to complement the second stage of the storyline, where, a mother swan is seen humming the music to her little ones, giving the classic melody, the feel of a birdsong cover. As the audio swings in, the toddler Daffy Duck is seen paddling over an unwanted honking, while his mother is worried until everything ends up to be fine.</p>
<p>On the take of preference credibility, the music was quite well appreciated by the globally known media critics.</p>
<h3 id="03Dance-of-the-Comedians"><a href="#03Dance-of-the-Comedians" class="headerlink" title="03Dance of the Comedians"></a>03Dance of the Comedians</h3><p>This music piece originally belongs to the music album, The Bartered Bride, and was first used in Zoom and Bored in 1957, to uplift the combating theme of the cartoon series.

Coyote, the protagonist of the story, against Road Runner, his nasty opponent, the climax of the music turns out to be the most loved operas of Czech origin.</p>
<p>About the fan base of the audio snippet, the composition claimed welcoming responses from a worldwide audience.</p>
<h3 id="04Minute-Waltz-in-D-Flat"><a href="#04Minute-Waltz-in-D-Flat" class="headerlink" title="04Minute Waltz in D-Flat"></a>04Minute Waltz in D-Flat</h3><p>This one was an explicitly stunning piece of background audio, which was added to the Hyde and Hare cartoon series of 1955, to complement the latter’s storyline with the best suited sound effects.</p>
<p>Entering into the storyline, you will find Bugs, the cutest of rabbits, tends to locate a piano in Dr. Jekyll’s yard, and the latter being the most sophisticated lagomorph ever; begins to explore his musical skills on the instrument. Things however, take an unwanted turn when Mr. Hyde, the antagonist barges in with an attempt of destroying everything.</p>
<p>While the music piece came to be known as the favorite pick of Waltz lovers, the latter received considerable applaud from other media critics as well.</p>
<h3 id="05Morning-Noon-and-Night-in-Vienna"><a href="#05Morning-Noon-and-Night-in-Vienna" class="headerlink" title="05Morning, Noon and Night in Vienna"></a>05Morning, Noon and Night in Vienna</h3><p>This audio background was an exclusive media add-on to Baton Bunny, the 1959 released <strong>musical cartoon movies</strong> series, which was a further episode of Bugs’ journey that features this adorable, broad toothed rabbit, taking on a conducting task in the land of Vienna.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that von Suppe, the developer of this music piece, also happened to work on a conducting profile, although on a comic note, the latter did not receive any appreciation for running behind odd smelling flies amid his performance!</p>
<p>Talking of the audience credibility, this one was a musical masterpiece, which received a large scale appreciation from listeners across the globe for featuring the most <strong>funny cartoon music</strong> ever!</p>
<h3 id="06The-Barber-of-Seville-Overture"><a href="#06The-Barber-of-Seville-Overture" class="headerlink" title="06The Barber of Seville Overture"></a>06The Barber of Seville Overture</h3><p>Like its aforesaid counterparts, this one was also an appreciated piece of audio, first heard in The Rabbit of Seville cartoon series, released in 1950. The musical luxury aims to compliment the combat Bugs, the adorable rabbit, against Elmer Fudd, the antagonist of the storyline, after the latter chases Bugs to a local stage. The music piece is a classic opera composition by Rossini that fails to miss out on a single beat or encounter a tempo breakdown.</p>
<p>The composition was fortunate enough to gain a positive critical acclaim from global audience as well as renowned critics of the artwork.</p>
<h3 id="07Beethoven’s-7th"><a href="#07Beethoven’s-7th" class="headerlink" title="07Beethoven’s 7th"></a>07Beethoven’s 7th</h3><p>This music piece is an addition to the list of classic opera melodies by Beethoven.

The storyline of the show talks of a speech fluent dog, longing for recognition in theatres commemorating the Shakespearean era, who is forced to lay back with his plans, thanks to the nasty pranks of the Goofy Gophers.</p>
<p>One of the antagonists attiring up like our poor dog, takes the credit of the efforts made by the latter and manages to get cast for a thrilling ghost scene in the Shakespearean tragedy of Hamlet.</p>
<p>Talking of the appreciation catered by the melody, the snippet was a somewhat strange composition, which made the critics, think of Beethoven being in a drunk state while creating the same.</p>
<h3 id="08Traumerei-Dreaming"><a href="#08Traumerei-Dreaming" class="headerlink" title="08Traumerei Dreaming"></a>08Traumerei Dreaming</h3><p>This one is a short 38 seconds snippet on a tender theme, which runs to supplement the assumption of Bugs, the protagonist bunny as dead by Oalfish Canine, the latter’s newest opponent. The cult line of the music piece was gloomy enough to get a removal from the censor board, leading to a considerable edit of the audio before its theatrical showcase. The final audio was, however, still too heavy on the modernized audience to undertake.</p>
<p>As is evident, critics of the audio regard it to be a bit hefty, though the sound is somewhat appealing to opera lovers.</p>
<h3 id="09Largo-al-Factotum"><a href="#09Largo-al-Factotum" class="headerlink" title="09Largo al Factotum"></a>09Largo al Factotum</h3><p>This high end opera was a rehearsal favorite of Giovanni Jones, the famous opera singer in The Long-Haired Hare, a well-known cartoon classic released in 1949. The star is supported in his streak by our adorable Bugs, who strums out loud on his banjo at a little distance.</p>
<p>All seemed well until Jones, in an annoyed state barges into break the poor rabbit’s instruments, while stretching him upwards through his long and pointed ears. The incident eventually transforms into war by the adorable bunny, who had been enraged by the time.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Adding a Suitable Cartoon Music</strong></p>
<p>Start with dragging the uploaded video files, one at a time, from Filmora’s media album to its timeline tracks. Take caution of the serial and non-redundant arrangement of the footage files in cohesion with the desired play sequence.</p>
<p>Next, proceed with adding the desired <strong>cartoon background music</strong> track above the already created video track, by using the conventional ‘Drag and Drop’ method. Check for any trimming requirements for adjusting the audio track length and position to be in concord with the video play time. While making position adjustments, you can simultaneously examine your changes in the editor’s ‘Preview Window’ and fine tune the same in real time.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Editing the Cartoon Music</strong></p>
<p>To edit your music, open the audio editing panel by double clicking the music file in the editor’s audio track. The feature allows you to enhance your cartoon music track by adding a variety of sound effects, like, fade in, fade out, volume adjustment, pitch tuning and setting up the Audio Equalizer.</p>
<p>You can also try hands on making a slow motion or fast forward version of the footage by varying the audio speed, while applying the ‘Reverse Speed’ effect for a reverse playback of the audio.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Export Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>When you are happy with your work, navigate to and click on the ‘Export’ tab at the bottom right corner of the program’s editor timeline. Save the edited <strong>cartoon music video</strong> to your device in any preferred file format in the pop-up window that appears next.</p>
<p>You can additionally create videos for iOS devices as well as upload your creations to various media sharing platforms, while also conveniently burning the same to a DVD for a television watch. For looping the cartoon music, just drag the audio clip to the exact length of the video footage.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-4"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-4" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and <strong>animation cartoons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Before you start learning 3d animation and create <strong>cartoon photos,</strong> ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-5"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-5" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and <strong>animation cartoons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Before you start learning 3d animation and create <strong>cartoon photos,</strong> ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-7"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-7" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and <strong>animation cartoons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Before you start learning 3d animation and create <strong>cartoon photos,</strong> ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.</p>

<h2 id="Learn-Pencil2D-Animation-Tutorial-Overview"><a href="#Learn-Pencil2D-Animation-Tutorial-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Learn Pencil2D Animation Tutorial Overview"></a>Learn Pencil2D Animation Tutorial Overview</h2><p>Animation is one of the trendiest technologies. The basics of animation were formulated in the 2000s from the moving page trick. The first few animators learned that animation is nothing but continuous switching of frames from one to another. One animated still is switched to another and then another in a quick sequence such that it makes a sequential moving frame. Today, animation has come a long way from where it started and today it is used for several commercials, tutorials, and even educational lecture videos. Pencil2D animation is an amazing animation tool that can be used by even neophytes. Want to learn more about 2d pencil animation and its super cool features? Well, you’re at the perfect place. Today we’ll be telling you more about pencil 2d animation and giving you a small overview of its usage.</p>

The brush tool"></a>1. The brush tool</h3><p>The brush tool must have reminded you of paint software in windows. The brush tool is a popular and highly utilitarian basic tool in Pencil2D animation software. You can either access it via the user interface or quickly access it by using the B key on your keyboard. As the name suggests, the brush tool is literally just a brush that allows you to draw and paint any sort of drawings of different shades, colors, and thickness. If you wish to change the color, you can find a color palette on the left side of the interface.</p>

<h3 id="2-The-eraser-tool"><a href="#2-The-eraser-tool" class="headerlink" title="2. The eraser tool"></a>2. The eraser tool</h3><p>You’ve a brush tool; it’s almost common sense that there’d be an eraser. The eraser tool has an eraser as its icon. If you wish to use the eraser, click on the eraser tool or simply click the E button on your keyboard. Once you’ve selected the tool, you need to simply hover over the parts you wish to erase.</p>

<h3 id="3-Bucket-tool"><a href="#3-Bucket-tool" class="headerlink" title="3. Bucket tool"></a>3. Bucket tool</h3><p>The bucket tool is another useful tool that you can find in the left tool pane of pencil 2d animation. The tool icon looks like a bucket and it is used to fill an entire area with a particular color. You can choose the color you’d like to fill from the color pallet available on the left side. Alternatively, you can also access the bucket tool by pressing the “K” key on your keyboard.</p>

<h3 id="4-Custom-colors"><a href="#4-Custom-colors" class="headerlink" title="4. Custom colors"></a>4. Custom colors</h3><p>A cool feature that you can find on pencil 2d animation software is the custom color one. You can merge and mix colors according to your choice and create your own color. To do so, you need to click on the small color box that you’ll find at the top right of your screen. By doing so, a huge color wheel will appear on your screen. Now you can either enter values of the R, G, and B if you wish to merge different colors and make a new one or select a particular color from the huge color wheel that appears in front of you. These colors vary in gradient, shade, and a lot of different factors.</p>

<h3 id="5-The-Undo-button"><a href="#5-The-Undo-button" class="headerlink" title="5. The Undo button"></a>5. The Undo button</h3><p>The Undo button is a highly useful functionality for the lazy ones who do not wish to erase the mistake they made. By undoing, the previous step gets reverted and you can start over again. The traditional undo shortcut, Ctrl+Z does work in the pencil 2d animation. Alternatively, you can also use the undo feature via the user interface. You can do so by heading over to the edit option in the topmost bar. The first option in the drop-down menu would be undo.</p>

Follow the steps listed below in order to learn how to animate through pencil 2d to make your first animation.</p>
<h3 id="1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame"><a href="#1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure that you’ve turned on your bitmap on the first frame"></a>1. Ensure that you’ve turned on your bitmap on the first frame</h3><p>Animation works through quick switching of frame which makes it appear as though the object is in motion. By turning on the bitmap, pencil 2d animation ensures that you’ve no blank frames at the start of your animation.</p>

<h3 id="2-Draw-your-animated-character"><a href="#2-Draw-your-animated-character" class="headerlink" title="2. Draw your animated character"></a>2. Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

<h3 id="3-The-three-circular-buttons"><a href="#3-The-three-circular-buttons" class="headerlink" title="3.The three circular buttons"></a>3.The three circular buttons</h3><p>Once you’re satisfied with the character you draw, you need to spot the 3 circular buttons which are arranged in the “+”,”-“,”+” order. By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

<h3 id="4-Repeat-until-you-get-an-animation"><a href="#4-Repeat-until-you-get-an-animation" class="headerlink" title="4.Repeat until you get an animation"></a>4.Repeat until you get an animation</h3><p>Now that you know how to deal with multiple frames, you can continue creating frames and making the animated characters move by tweaking with the drawing in every frame. For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

The brush tool"></a>1. The brush tool</h3><p>The brush tool must have reminded you of paint software in windows. The brush tool is a popular and highly utilitarian basic tool in Pencil2D animation software. You can either access it via the user interface or quickly access it by using the B key on your keyboard. As the name suggests, the brush tool is literally just a brush that allows you to draw and paint any sort of drawings of different shades, colors, and thickness. If you wish to change the color, you can find a color palette on the left side of the interface.</p>

The eraser tool</h3><p>You’ve a brush tool; it’s almost common sense that there’d be an eraser. The eraser tool has an eraser as its icon. If you wish to use the eraser, click on the eraser tool or simply click the E button on your keyboard. Once you’ve selected the tool, you need to simply hover over the parts you wish to erase.</p>

<h3 id="3-Bucket-tool-3"><a href="#3-Bucket-tool-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Bucket tool"></a>3. Bucket tool</h3><p>The bucket tool is another useful tool that you can find in the left tool pane of pencil 2d animation. The tool icon looks like a bucket and it is used to fill an entire area with a particular color. You can choose the color you’d like to fill from the color pallet available on the left side. Alternatively, you can also access the bucket tool by pressing the “K” key on your keyboard.</p>

<h3 id="4-Custom-colors-3"><a href="#4-Custom-colors-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Custom colors"></a>4. Custom colors</h3><p>A cool feature that you can find on pencil 2d animation software is the custom color one. You can merge and mix colors according to your choice and create your own color. To do so, you need to click on the small color box that you’ll find at the top right of your screen. By doing so, a huge color wheel will appear on your screen. Now you can either enter values of the R, G, and B if you wish to merge different colors and make a new one or select a particular color from the huge color wheel that appears in front of you. These colors vary in gradient, shade, and a lot of different factors.</p>

The Undo button</h3><p>The Undo button is a highly useful functionality for the lazy ones who do not wish to erase the mistake they made. By undoing, the previous step gets reverted and you can start over again. The traditional undo shortcut, Ctrl+Z does work in the pencil 2d animation. Alternatively, you can also use the undo feature via the user interface. You can do so by heading over to the edit option in the topmost bar. The first option in the drop-down menu would be undo.</p>

Follow the steps listed below in order to learn how to animate through pencil 2d to make your first animation.</p>
<h3 id="1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame-3"><a href="#1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

By turning on the bitmap, pencil 2d animation ensures that you’ve no blank frames at the start of your animation.</p>

Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>
