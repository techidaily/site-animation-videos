<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>To develop your cartoon style, you need to practice drawing regularly.</strong></p>
<p>To get s grasp this whole process of Animation, you need to draw and practice <strong>different cartoon art styles.</strong> You can draw anything you like, or you don’t like on paper or on a drawing tablet. You can also color sketchbooks to improve your skills in Animation.</p>
<p>You can use Filmora to make cartoon videos and, at the same time, make cartoon videos of normally captured videos. These cartoon videos can be compiled into one video. You can use this video to edit different types of videos. Filmora has a user-friendly interface that can help you create your cartoon video effortlessly.</p>

<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png"
                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 07"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 12"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 12"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>
