<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [6 Animated Powerpoint Templates with Interactive Features](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-6-Animated-PowerPoint-Templates-with-Interactive-Features"><a href="#Part-1-6-Animated-PowerPoint-Templates-with-Interactive-Features" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features"></a>Part 1 <strong>6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features</strong></h2><p>The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>
<h3 id="01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template"><a href="#01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template" class="headerlink" title="01Company Presentation PowerPoint Template"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm_campaign=elements_af_493214&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius&mp=Theme%20Junkie"><strong>Company Presentation PowerPoint Template</strong></a></h3><p>For the first of the <strong>Moving Animation PowerPoint</strong> templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Open-Project"><a href="#01Step-1-Open-Project" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Open Project."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Open Project.</strong></h3><p>First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

Add Animation.</strong></h3><p>Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="03Step-3-Choose-Animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Choose-Animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Choose Animation."></a>03<strong>Step 3. Choose Animation.</strong></h3><p>Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path Animation</strong>, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Choose Motion Path Animation</strong></h3><p>In order to make <strong>motion animation in PowerPoint</strong>, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.</p>
<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h3 id="05Step-5-Adjust-Animation"><a href="#05Step-5-Adjust-Animation" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5. Adjust Animation."></a>05<strong>Step 5. Adjust Animation.</strong></h3><p>With <strong>path animation PowerPoint</strong> complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.</p>

Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions"><a href="#01Transitions" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations"><a href="#02Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start"><a href="#03Animation-Start" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>

<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>

<h3 id="05Animation-Delay"><a href="#05Animation-Delay" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>

<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>

<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>
<h3 id="01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template-1"><a href="#01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="01Company Presentation PowerPoint Template"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm_campaign=elements_af_493214&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius&mp=Theme%20Junkie"><strong>Company Presentation PowerPoint Template</strong></a></h3><p>For the first of the <strong>Moving Animation PowerPoint</strong> templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h3 id="01Transitions-1"><a href="#01Transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>

<h3 id="02Animations-1"><a href="#02Animations-1" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>

<h3 id="03Animation-Start-1"><a href="#03Animation-Start-1" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-1"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>

<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-1"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-1" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>

<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-1"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-1" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>

<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-1"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-1" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-1"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-1" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>

<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-1"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-1" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-1"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-1" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>
<h3 id="01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template-2"><a href="#01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template-2" class="headerlink" title="01Company Presentation PowerPoint Template"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm_campaign=elements_af_493214&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius&mp=Theme%20Junkie"><strong>Company Presentation PowerPoint Template</strong></a></h3><p>For the first of the <strong>Moving Animation PowerPoint</strong> templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-2"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-2"><a href="#01Transitions-2" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-2"><a href="#02Animations-2" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-2"><a href="#03Animation-Start-2" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png"
                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-2"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-2" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-2"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-2" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-2"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-2" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Separate into Sections with Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-2"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-2" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-2"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-2" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add Animation - Emphasis"
                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-2"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-2" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-2"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-2" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

<p>PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> presentations.</p>
<p>Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)</p>

As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.</p>
<p>However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why <strong>moving animation PowerPoint</strong> templates are such a big deal:</p>
<h3 id="01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template-3"><a href="#01Company-Presentation-PowerPoint-Template-3" class="headerlink" title="01Company Presentation PowerPoint Template"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm_campaign=elements_af_493214&iradtype=ONLINE_TRACKING_LINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=impact_radius&mp=Theme%20Junkie"><strong>Company Presentation PowerPoint Template</strong></a></h3><p>For the first of the <strong>Moving Animation PowerPoint</strong> templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.</p>

The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.</p>

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.</p>

Choose Motion Path Animation</strong></h3><p>In order to make <strong>motion animation in PowerPoint</strong>, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.</p>
<p>In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-3"><a href="#Part-3-10-Moving-Animation-PowerPoint-Techniques-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques"></a>Part 3 <strong>10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques</strong></h2><p>For this last step, we break down some important <strong>PowerPoint 3D Animation</strong> need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.</p>
<h3 id="01Transitions-3"><a href="#01Transitions-3" class="headerlink" title="01Transitions"></a>01<strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png"
                      alt="PowerPoint Transitions"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Animations-3"><a href="#02Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02<strong>Animations</strong></h3><p>Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PowerPoint Animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation-Start-3"><a href="#03Animation-Start-3" class="headerlink" title="03Animation - Start"></a>03<strong>Animation - Start</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.</p>
<p>In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Start"
                ></p>
<h3 id="044-Animation-Duration-3"><a href="#044-Animation-Duration-3" class="headerlink" title="044. Animation - Duration"></a>04<strong>4. Animation - Duration</strong></h3><p>Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a <strong>PowerPoint 3D rotation animation</strong> into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animation - Duration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Animation-Delay-3"><a href="#05Animation-Delay-3" class="headerlink" title="05Animation - Delay"></a>05<strong>Animation - Delay</strong></h3><p>This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-3"><a href="#06Break-Up-Presentation-into-Sections-3" class="headerlink" title="06Break Up Presentation into Sections"></a>06<strong>Break Up Presentation into Sections</strong></h3><p>A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="07Add-Animation-Entrance-3"><a href="#07Add-Animation-Entrance-3" class="headerlink" title="07Add Animation - Entrance"></a>07<strong>Add Animation - Entrance</strong></h3><p>As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is “Entrance” animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fade: To have objects fade into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.</p>

                      alt="Add Animation - Entrance"
                ></p>
<h3 id="08Add-Animation-Emphasis-3"><a href="#08Add-Animation-Emphasis-3" class="headerlink" title="08Add Animation - Emphasis"></a>08<strong>Add Animation - Emphasis</strong></h3><p>This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="099-Add-Animation-Exit-3"><a href="#099-Add-Animation-Exit-3" class="headerlink" title="099. Add Animation - Exit"></a>09<strong>9. Add Animation - Exit</strong></h3><p>Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.</p>

<h3 id="10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-3"><a href="#10Add-Animation-Motion-Path-3" class="headerlink" title="10Add Animation - Motion Path"></a>10<strong>Add Animation - Motion Path</strong></h3><p>We’ve already mentioned the <strong>PowerPoint Motion Path animation</strong> style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.</p>

<p>Character development can be referred to as the stages from making the concept to animation. Over the years, as the process becomes more accessible, the detail that the character artist can show on their characters becomes higher.</p>
<p>The person who designs the <strong>animation 3D character</strong> is usually the first person on a production to visualize the characters from the description given to them in a story.</p>

In these steps, you can draw and model the characters differently using the excellent animation software mentioned in this article. During designing, make sure you don’t rush the design texturing. Texture can be according to art’s concept, which you can assign to the model.</p>

All the <strong>3D rigged characters for animation</strong> can move from animators, while 3D models combine with a rigged skeleton in skinning. This step is because it controls the rig, which can easily change the 3D model. Animates the model, which is one of the most critical and time-consuming tasks which involves you adding life to your 3D character. More so, this affects you using a 3D application to ensure that the objects or models adjust according to your need.</p>

You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.</p>
<h3 id="01-Smurfette"><a href="#01-Smurfette" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.</p>
<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.</p>
<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat"><a href="#05Top-Cat" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He’s wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he’s making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones’ basic Hanna-Barbera art style.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<h3 id="06Helga-G-Pataki"><a href="#06Helga-G-Pataki" class="headerlink" title="06Helga. G. Pataki"></a>06Helga. G. Pataki</h3><p>Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There’s a lot that’s bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it. Just keep an eye on her head since getting it correct, especially with her rectangle hairdo, can be a little odd.</p>
<p>These are some of the <strong>cool animated characters to draw.</strong></p>

<h3 id="01How-to-Draw-Cartoon-Characters"><a href="#01How-to-Draw-Cartoon-Characters" class="headerlink" title="01How to Draw Cartoon Characters"></a>01How to Draw Cartoon Characters</h3><p>We’ll go through the fundamentals of human perception before getting into cartoon face drawing. Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.</p>

A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.</p>

                ></p>
<p>When creating a nose from the front, it’s typical to leave off many details. Even if you merely sketch its tip, it will likely provide a convincing impact. Drawing only one side of the nose is also quite frequent. Children’s mouths are extremely simple in cartoon style, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>The ears are viewed from the front; therefore, the internal holes are not visible. The circle has already established the shape of our head.</p>

A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.</p>

<p>When creating a nose from the front, it’s typical to leave off many details. Even if you merely sketch its tip, it will likely provide a convincing impact. Drawing only one side of the nose is also quite frequent. Children’s mouths are extremely simple in cartoon style, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>The ears are viewed from the front; therefore, the internal holes are not visible. The circle has already established the shape of our head.</p>

You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.</p>
<h3 id="01-Smurfette-3"><a href="#01-Smurfette-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles-3"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles-3" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.</p>
<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear-3"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear-3" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.</p>
<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla-3"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla-3" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat-3"><a href="#05Top-Cat-3" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He’s wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he’s making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones’ basic Hanna-Barbera art style.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<h3 id="06Helga-G-Pataki-3"><a href="#06Helga-G-Pataki-3" class="headerlink" title="06Helga. G. Pataki"></a>06Helga. G. Pataki</h3><p>Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There’s a lot that’s bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it. Just keep an eye on her head since getting it correct, especially with her rectangle hairdo, can be a little odd.</p>
<p>These are some of the <strong>cool animated characters to draw.</strong></p>

Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

<h3 id="3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan"><a href="#3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan" class="headerlink" title="3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)"></a>3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

<h3 id="4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China"><a href="#4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China" class="headerlink" title="4. Death Note (Banned in China)"></a>4. Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

<h3 id="5-Attack-on-Titan-Banned-in-China"><a href="#5-Attack-on-Titan-Banned-in-China" class="headerlink" title="5. Attack on Titan (Banned in China)"></a>5. Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

<h3 id="6-High-School-DxD-Banned-in-New-Zealand"><a href="#6-High-School-DxD-Banned-in-New-Zealand" class="headerlink" title="6. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)"></a>6. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-3"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more.

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

Its simply the creation of conventional story telling procedure where text, images, diagrams, figures, etc are drawn onto a white surface.</p>

<p>In creating this type of videos, script writes are usually employed because of the dynamics involved in creating them. The major users of whiteboard animation video are business owners and people in the education fields. Other people make use of it but these two groups are the major users.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is important because it helps viewers remember the contents of what they watched better than looking at an image that contains a lot of information that may not always be organized.</p>
<p>Over time, whiteboard videos have become a more compelling and innovative method of dissemination information. They work so well because it’s a more relatable and fun way of making videos. It goes outside the conventional video making techniques and employs the animation standards which is fun to watch, engaging and still maintains the ability to effective pass the required information to the viewers.</p>
<p>Also, it uses a unique style to mix text, animations, and colors to drive the point home. Viewers are usually glued to their screen while watching it. The usual white background equally makes the information being displayed to effective contrast with each other. However, there is a recent movement from the usual white background to any color of choice while still maintaining the contrasting quality of the videos.</p>
<p>Finally, people tend to remember events or information if they are told as stories. This is one of the major objectives of whiteboard animation videos. They use graphics and animations to tell stories, sell products and services while maintaining the fun in it.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation video usually takes time to create. Its not always as easy as it may seem. It takes dedication and patience before you perfect the video. if you’re new to this, its ok to not have that perfect video immediately. What matters is your will to grow and get better.</p>
