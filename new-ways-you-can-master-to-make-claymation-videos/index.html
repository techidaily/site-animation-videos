<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

While the Puppet Putty works great by itself, you can also combine it with other types of clay to make your clay models more appealing.</p>
<h3 id="02Van-Aken"><a href="#02Van-Aken" class="headerlink" title="02Van Aken"></a>02Van Aken</h3><p>Van Aken is another popular clay brand that’s ideal for <strong>claymation animations</strong>.

Some animators also mix Van Aken with Pupper Putty to make the characters look more stunning under the perfect lighting conditions.</p>
<h3 id="03Sargent-Art"><a href="#03Sargent-Art" class="headerlink" title="03Sargent Art"></a>03Sargent Art</h3><p>Sargent Art is a brand that primarily designs clays for sculpting.

<h3 id="04Sculpey"><a href="#04Sculpey" class="headerlink" title="04Sculpey"></a>04Sculpey</h3><p>Sculpey is a clay brand that designs polymer-based clays that are relatively better than the traditional ceramic mud clays. This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="05Plastilina"><a href="#05Plastilina" class="headerlink" title="05Plastilina"></a>05Plastilina</h3><p>Finally, Plastilina is also a great option for <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> models.

<p>But, if you are someone who wants to get into animation, but don’t have an expensive budget, claymations can be a great tool to share your story with the world and attract a global audience. In this guide, we are going to talk about claymations, some of the most popular claymation websites, and the best ways to get started with <strong>stop motion claymation</strong>. So, if you also want to explore your creative side and be unique with the approach, continue reading. By the end of this guide, you’ll be running out to buy clay and make some high-quality <strong>clay stop-motion animations</strong>.</p>

<p>03 [Best 5 Clay for Stop Motion and Ways to Get Started](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone-3"><a href="#Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone"></a>Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone</h2><p>So, now that you are familiar with the basic concept of <strong>clay stop animation</strong>, let’s understand how you can get started with claymation animations. Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

So, the next part would be to turn these raw images into an animation. To do this, you can use different types of video editing applications. However, we recommend using Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.</p>
