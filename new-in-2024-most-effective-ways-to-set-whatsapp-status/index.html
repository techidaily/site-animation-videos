<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>

                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script-2"><a href="#01Write-a-Script-2" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img

                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard-2"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard-2" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img

                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images-2"><a href="#03Create-Images-2" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images-2"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images-2" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-2"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-2" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

                      alt="filmora-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script-3"><a href="#01Write-a-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-5.jpg"
                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard-3"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard-3" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-6.jpg"
                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images-3"><a href="#03Create-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-7.jpg"
                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images-3"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-8.jpg"
                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-9.jpg"
                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop video repeat"
                ></p>

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-1"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-1"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-1"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-2"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-2"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-2"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop video repeat"

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-3"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-3"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop video repeat"

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-GIF"><a href="#Part-1-Why-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why GIF?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why GIF?</strong></h2><p>Before we move on to the tutorials, let’s do a brief account on GIF files We’ve also answered some of the more common questions regarding using a <strong>GIF image maker</strong> below for your edification</p>
<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

These occur often with GIF makers that support transparency If you find these happening to you, adjust the transparency settings to get rid of the white pixel outline around your converted GIF.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

These occur often with GIF makers that support transparency If you find these happening to you, adjust the transparency settings to get rid of the white pixel outline around your converted GIF.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-1"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-1" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif14.png"
                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-2"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-2" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif8.png"
                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif14.png"
                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-3"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-3" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif8.png"
                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif9.png"
                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif10.png"
                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif11.png"
                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif14.png"
                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif16.png"
                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif17.png"
                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif18.png"
