<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 04"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>

<p>The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet’s skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.</p>

<p>To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story’s overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.</p>

<p><strong>Animation Editing:</strong></p>
<p>Also, you can make a stop motion video on Filmora by considering the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Camera Steadiness is a must for every shot you plan for Stop Motion Video. Shaking a camera is not good. Else, your video won’t be smooth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ensure capture the shot under consistent light and prevent light exposure from changing on the object; otherwise, there will be inconsistency in the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To make it easier, play the film in advance, as the more friends your video, the smoother the video will be.</p>
<p>Here are steps to make a stop motion video on Filmora:</p>
<p>Step 1 Place the camera steady and bring your object in the frame. Lightly move your things and capture the movement frame by frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 02"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Download and start, or if you have already installed, run the Filmora program and choose a suitable frame rate in the project settings. After selecting the resolution, click on the file and go to the project setting.</p>

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Now import the media file using the import option from the file menu and import the captured images.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make stop motion puppet 03"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Adjust the menu’s preference or press the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+, and a window will appear on your screen. Select the editing panel and change the photo duration between 0.2 to 0.5 seconds.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Once done with all the settings and satisfied with the results, click on export and select your desired video format. Your video will be exported and saved in your library so you can share it with friends.</p>
