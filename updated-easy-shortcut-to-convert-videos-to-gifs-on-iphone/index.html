<p>Childhood crushes and idolization of <strong>animated characters</strong> were very normal things! <strong>Popular animated characters</strong> were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!</p>
<p>Today, in order to reminisce a little, we’ll be going through some of the more <strong>famous animated characters</strong>!</p>
<p>Although we initially promised only 15 <strong>animated characters</strong>, we’ve stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more <strong>popular animated characters</strong> to reminisce about! We’ve also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!</p>
<h3 id="01Mickey-Mouse"><a href="#01Mickey-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="01Mickey Mouse"></a>01Mickey Mouse</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Steamboat Willie (1928)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine</p>
<p>When it comes to admirable <strong>animated characters</strong>, Disney’s Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune! He merited the top spot simply for that fame, even though, in all honesty, his time on the big screen had been pretty limited (with his biggest performance having been from Fantasia).</p>

<h3 id="02Woody"><a href="#02Woody" class="headerlink" title="02Woody"></a>02Woody</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tom Hanks</p>
<p>We of course also cannot forget Toy Story’s Woody in a discussion of <strong>famous animated characters</strong>. This cowboy toy comes equipped with a pull-string that just oozes personality (both good and bad), leading up to a very satisfying movie-watching experience as we watch him grow from the selfish toy that he had been in the beginning to the generous, and forgiving toy that he developed into by the fourth movie in the series!</p>

<h3 id="03Buzz-Lightyear"><a href="#03Buzz-Lightyear" class="headerlink" title="03Buzz Lightyear"></a>03Buzz Lightyear</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tim Allen</p>
<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Finding Nemo (2003)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>Dory was undoubtedly the underdog of the Finding Nemo franchise! This lovable fish, <strong>Voiced by</strong> the equally loveable Ellen DeGeneres, stole the show and earned herself her own feature film that all the animated movie lovers came to watch in 2016! Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Hitoshi Takagi</p>
<p>Speaking of cute characters, how can one forget about Totoro! Despite having been written in a different language, ‘My Neighbor Totoro’ has managed to burrow its way into the hearts of many a movie watcher. And of course, this is all things to the loveable animated character, Totoro — who is cuddly, gentle, and peaceful!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Aladdin (1992)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Robin Williams</p>
<p>When talking about <strong>animated characters</strong>, one must also not forget the phenomenal performance of Genie from the Aladdin franchise! <strong>Voiced by</strong> Robin Williams, Genie was brought to life in a way that changed the industry for good, bringing an influx of more lively voice acting in the future!</p>
<p>If you’re the type to want to <strong>make your animated character</strong>, taking inspiration from Robin William’s Genie would surely not lead you astray! In fact, you can get started on it today, if you wanted! All you have to do is pick up a good mic and a professional video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> Pro that can help you in your quest to bring your characters to life!</p>

<h3 id="07Wall-E"><a href="#07Wall-E" class="headerlink" title="07Wall-E"></a>07Wall-E</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Wall-E (2008)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Cameo in Cars (2006)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ben Burtt</p>
<p>Wall-E broke the box office for its underlying message regarding how we humans treat our world, but also because of its loveable characters! Who can say that they did not fall in love with Wall-E and his darling Eve? Despite his almost-mute character, he was brought to life in a way that made him very easy to love and would be remembered for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="08Donkey"><a href="#08Donkey" class="headerlink" title="08Donkey"></a>08Donkey</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek 3, Shrek Forever After, a Christmas short</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Shrek</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Eddie Murphy</p>
<p>Shrek’s Donkey is another one of those characters that you just cannot forget! <strong>Voiced by</strong> the hilarious Eddie Murphy, he added that constant spark of humor that kept the movie’s tone light and exciting, fully encompassing the kind of tone that the film was going for.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="09Cruella-de-Vil"><a href="#09Cruella-de-Vil" class="headerlink" title="09Cruella de Vil"></a>09Cruella de Vil</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: 101 Dalmatians</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: 101 Dalmatians</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Betty Lou Gerson</p>
<p>When it comes to classic villain <strong>animated characters</strong>, one cannot forget about the illustrious Cruella de Vil! This character was pure evil in a feminine form! Designed to be the enemy of puppy lovers everywhere all while bringing a little spice into what would have otherwise been a sweet, slice of life film.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="10Boo"><a href="#10Boo" class="headerlink" title="10Boo"></a>10Boo</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Monsters Inc.</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Monsters Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Mary Gibbs</p>
<p>Boo from Monsters Inc is one of the most <strong>popular animated characters</strong> on the big screen! She was loveable, sweet, and perfectly voice acted — bringing on some much-needed cute into the heart-warming story.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Monsters Inc</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Billy Crystal</p>
<p>Still on the Monster Inc train, we have Mike Wasowski! His refreshing character brought some levity into the story, bringing on some much-needed laughs and just, in general, providing a solid counterpart to Sulley!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="12Toothless"><a href="#12Toothless" class="headerlink" title="12Toothless"></a>12Toothless</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon, How to Train your Dragon 2</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="13Chihiro"><a href="#13Chihiro" class="headerlink" title="13Chihiro"></a>13Chihiro</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase</p>
<p>The story of Chihiro from ‘Spirited Away’ is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget! This character, if you weren’t aware, was also created by Miyazaki (the same creator of ‘Totoro!’) She’s a part of a long line of greatly designed and developed characters whose journey you just can’t look away from.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="14Lumiere"><a href="#14Lumiere" class="headerlink" title="14Lumiere"></a>14Lumiere</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991), The Enchanted Christmas (1997)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jerry Orbach</p>
<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved <strong>Disney Animated Characters</strong>, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (<strong>Voiced by</strong> Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the ‘Be Our Guest’ track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast’s love story.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="15Sophie"><a href="#15Sophie" class="headerlink" title="15Sophie"></a>15Sophie</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Chieko Baisho; Emily Mortimer &amp; Jean Simmons</p>
<p>To wrap up our main list, we have another Miyazaki character in the form of Sophie — from Howl’s Moving Castle! Howl’s Moving Castle is another beautiful classic that you just can’t help but love, and a lot of that is all thanks to its complex and believable heroine, Sophie!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #1: Baloo</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: The Jungle Book (1967), The Jungle Book 2 (2003)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: The Jungle Book (1967)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Phil Harris; John Goodman</p>
<p>For the first of our honorable mentions, we have Baloo from ‘The Jungle Book’! Baloo is soft and cuddly — perfectly loveable while providing sage advice for the main character! His performance in the film was certainly an unforgettable one (worth the repeat viewing!)</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #2: Maleficent</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Sleeping Beauty (1959)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Sleeping Beauty (1959)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Eleanor Audley</p>
<p>Maleficent from ‘Sleeping Beauty’ also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent’s LIVE action form merited a sequel.</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Dumbo (1941)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Dumbo (1941)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>Dumbo joins the cast of cute and cuddly characters that manage to make an impact with little to no words! His amazing animation managed to convey his entire story despite his muteness, speaking to the great talent of his animators!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #4: Coraline</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Coraline (2008)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Coraline (2008)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Dakota Fanning</p>
<p>Coraline’s animation is certainly unique, but that’s one of the reasons why she and her film stand out so much! In terms of <strong>animated characters</strong>, Coraline stands out with her unique design and equally unique story. She’s certainly not a heroine that you should mess with!</p>
<p><strong>Related Movie Clips</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Honorable Mention #5: Jack Skellington</p>
<p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Chris Sarandon, Henry Sellick (singing)</p>
<p>Although Jack Skellington’s film, ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’ may not be as well known as others, those that do know of it speak well of his character! His complex personality gives way for a very interesting tale, one that has captivated many an audience and merited repeat viewings (perfect for the holiday season!)</p>

<p>Today, in order to reminisce a little, we’ll be going through some of the more <strong>famous animated characters</strong>!</p>

We’ve also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!</p>
<h3 id="01Mickey-Mouse-3"><a href="#01Mickey-Mouse-3" class="headerlink" title="01Mickey Mouse"></a>01Mickey Mouse</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)</p>

<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tim Allen</p>
<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep!

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991)</p>

<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic!

So, let’s dive into each element in detail.</p>
<h3 id="01Recommended-Age-1"><a href="#01Recommended-Age-1" class="headerlink" title="01Recommended Age"></a>01Recommended Age</h3><p>Producing something creative with a Stop Motion Animation kit will be a lengthy process that will involve patience and some informational content to use the Kits properly. So while selecting the best Animation Kit, keep in mind the Recommended Age that the company has specified. If the product is for the young generation, the younger ones might have difficulty using the product.</p>
<h3 id="02Different-forms-of-Kits-1"><a href="#02Different-forms-of-Kits-1" class="headerlink" title="02Different forms of Kits"></a>02Different forms of Kits</h3><p>You may check a few of them with different <strong>Features</strong> for the best stop animation kits. However, the significant difference between them is whether they come as complete kits or not. If you buy a complete kit, you will have a camera and other elements with the product.</p>
<p>The only thing you will require other than the entire animation kit would be a computer for software purposes. Moreover, you can also select Kits that do not come with a camera individually.</p>
<p>For this, you must use a smartphone to record the video. Conclusively, the kits present on the market are zoetrope-type kits. However, they are not available with electronics. So you won’t be able to create full films with this one.</p>

<h3 id="01Recommended-Age-2"><a href="#01Recommended-Age-2" class="headerlink" title="01Recommended Age"></a>01Recommended Age</h3><p>Producing something creative with a Stop Motion Animation kit will be a lengthy process that will involve patience and some informational content to use the Kits properly. So while selecting the best Animation Kit, keep in mind the Recommended Age that the company has specified.

So, let’s dive into each element in detail.</p>
<h3 id="01Recommended-Age-3"><a href="#01Recommended-Age-3" class="headerlink" title="01Recommended Age"></a>01Recommended Age</h3><p>Producing something creative with a Stop Motion Animation kit will be a lengthy process that will involve patience and some informational content to use the Kits properly. So while selecting the best Animation Kit, keep in mind the Recommended Age that the company has specified. If the product is for the young generation, the younger ones might have difficulty using the product.</p>
<h3 id="02Different-forms-of-Kits-3"><a href="#02Different-forms-of-Kits-3" class="headerlink" title="02Different forms of Kits"></a>02Different forms of Kits</h3><p>You may check a few of them with different <strong>Features</strong> for the best stop animation kits. However, the significant difference between them is whether they come as complete kits or not. If you buy a complete kit, you will have a camera and other elements with the product.</p>
<p>The only thing you will require other than the entire animation kit would be a computer for software purposes. Moreover, you can also select Kits that do not come with a camera individually.</p>
<p>For this, you must use a smartphone to record the video. Conclusively, the kits present on the market are zoetrope-type kits. However, they are not available with electronics. So you won’t be able to create full films with this one.</p>
<h3 id="03Extra-Features-3"><a href="#03Extra-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="03Extra Features"></a>03Extra <strong>Features</strong></h3><p>As extra <strong>Features</strong>, you get Props and full-on sets included with some of the kits. These allow you to create the scenes that you are looking for. You can also transform the orientation of some of the props, which gives you extra functionality.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Capture The Shots</strong></p>
<p>Move an object and capture its movement frame by frame. Suppose we are making a stop motion video of bottle spin. Place your camera in a steady place, and bring your object in the frame. Move your object slightly and take a shot. Keep doing this until you have at least 12,23or photos of the object’s movement. We took the bottle spin only as an example. You can create your ideas here.</p>

<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-20"><a href="#In-this-article-20" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>That’s it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.</p>

<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-22"><a href="#In-this-article-22" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg"
                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animations in unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.</p>

Why? Because Unity is more suitable for animating objects for games. Not to mention, Unity has a steep learning curve and if you are not an experienced Unity developer, you may fail to create a 2D animation properly.</p>
<p>So, if you only need a 2D animation for videos, we have a better alternative for the job. Instead of Unity, you can use <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.
