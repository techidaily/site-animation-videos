<p>Reach to the ‘File’ menu and choose ‘Preferences’ from the latter’s dropdown menu. In the ‘Preferences’ window, hit the ‘Editing’ tab and tap on ‘Photo Preferences’. From the drop down menu that follows, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option to adjust the aspect ratio of your imported images in line with the slideshow project. In case your images have the 9:16 vertical aspect ratio, select the ‘Fit’ option to make a proper screen fit.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to include the image zoom and camera pan features within your project by clicking on the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option. You can further, modify the preset durations of transitions, effects and photos in the ‘Editing’ tab itself before adding them to the editor timeline. Another way of doing the same is to drag the ends of the media files inward or outward, post the timeline adding process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-18.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Effect Play Duration Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p>When you have finished making the required adjustments, navigate back the ‘Media Panel’ to include the imported media files within the project timeline. You can either click on the files to add them, or choose to ‘Drag and Drop’ the same at a preferred place within the timeline.</p>
<p>When all the images and videos have been added, proceed to arrange them in the desired order of appearance in the slideshow, followed by adjusting their screen time and play durations through any of the methods explained above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-19.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Slide Transitions"
                ></p>
<p>Post the timeline adding of a transition, you can double click on the same to reach the ‘Transition Setting Window’, where you are allowed to customize the play duration and select its ‘Transition Mode’. Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Overlays and Filters for an Improvised Colour Scheme</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Filters and Overlays"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Include Motion Graphic Elements</strong></p>
<p>To supplement your slideshow with elegant motion graphics, navigate to the ‘Elements’ tab in the editor timeline. From here, you can access and choose any suitable motion graphic template from a diversity of available choices, to include within the project timeline. The step is completely optional and you should pay attention to the style of content presentation and the cause of creation of your slideshow when choosing to add these elements to the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-21.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Including Motion Graphic Elements"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Record Voiceovers and Create Soundtracks</strong></p>
<p>To record a voiceover for your slideshow, navigate to the ‘Media’ tab and tap the ‘Record’ dropdown menu. Click on ‘Record Voiceover’ in the list of options that appears. The ‘Record Audio’ icon pops up and you now need to select a microphone to be used in the recording process. When you are ready, tap the ‘Record’ button to let the recording begin.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Voiceover Recording"
                ></p>
<p>You can now see your voice recording appear in the ‘Media’ tab with the previously imported media files, ready to be placed within the audio track of the project timeline. Filmora’s audio library is a storehouse of free access music and audio effects. To add one to your slideshow, navigate and click on the ‘Audio’ tab to select from the extensive Rock, Young &amp; Bright, Electronic, etc., music subcategories till you get the perfect match for your presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-23.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Soundtracks"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the music tracks, place them one by one on the project timeline and move ahead with adjusting their play durations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Export Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>When you are satisfied with your work, you can export the slideshow directly from Filmora to a number of media sharing platforms. All you need to do is, navigate to and tap the ‘Export’ button in the top right corner of the editor screen and proceed to set the resolution and frame rate, and select the output file format of your created slideshow in the ‘Export Window’ that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-24.JPG"
                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Slideshow Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready with everything, click on the ‘Export’ button at the bottom right corner of the screen to share your slideshow across different platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, Vimeo, etc.</p>
<p>The time required by Filmora to render your slideshow on the chosen platform will depend on the output file size. Considering the fact that larger files require a much longer time to be rendered, it would be a smart decision to limit the file size of your slideshow within 500 MB.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

                ></p>

<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

                      alt="add feet skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>

                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img

That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>

For example, the eyes’ shape and size will help determine if the person is feeling sad, excited, happy, excited, or sad. In addition, the amount of lift under a person’s eyebrows can help determine whether a person is mad or not.</p>

However, these days we get exposed to everyday adaptations of facial expressions, especially with the invention of Instagram, Snapchat, and cartoon face filters.</p>
<p>Consequently, cartoons are a combination of different shapes that are being put together and are not difficult if the focus is on each shape individually and the process breaks down step by step.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head.

For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>
