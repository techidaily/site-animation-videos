<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-Text-Motion"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-Text-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s Text Motion?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What’s Text Motion?</strong></h2><p>Alright, first of all, let’s answer the big question! <strong>Text Motion</strong>, what is it and why should you be adding it to your projects ASAP? Well, in regards to the former, the answer is simple: <strong>text motion graphics</strong> is literally text animation that you can add to your projects to give it an extra bit of life and make it more show-stealing!</p>

                ></p>
<p>Have a look at the screenshot above that we included of an example project on the video editor, <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. As you can see, we inserted <strong>text in motion</strong> at the very start. And despite being a still screenshot of said <strong>text motion graphics</strong>, the preview is eye-catching even when paused!</p>
<p>This is the kind of project that you can do yourself with the right templates and the right video editor. We’ve got your back on the first in the list coming up. And, as for the second, we recommend that you try out Filmora! It is, as you can see, quite an expansive software. One that will allow you to truly make the most of the <strong>text motion graphics</strong> you’ll be able to create at the end of this article.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Text-Motion-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Text-Motion-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 10 Best Text Motion After Effects"></a>Part 2 <strong>10 Best Text Motion After Effects</strong></h2><p>Alright, now let’s move on to our promised <strong>Text Motion Graphics After Effects</strong> and <strong>Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro</strong> templates. We’ve tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!</p>
<h3 id="01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="01Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal’ by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you’re confused, it’s a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.</p>
<p>Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.</p>
<h3 id="02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title"><a href="#02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title" class="headerlink" title="02Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title"></a>02<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title</strong></a></h3><p>The next <strong>text motion</strong> template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title’ also created by Mogrt. This one is <strong>text motion graphics</strong> that you can use for <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It’s a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!</p>
<p>As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as <strong>text motion</strong> for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt" >after effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is available for that as well!</p>
<h3 id="03Simple-Motion-Text-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#03Simple-Motion-Text-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="03Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro"></a>03<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?_ga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text’ graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we’ve provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that’s just starting out and doesn’t want anything too complicated.</p>
<h3 id="0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt"><a href="#0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="0430 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt"></a>04<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?_ga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets’ by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It’s also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it’s not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch’ effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn’t make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!</p>
<p>The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT"><a href="#05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT" class="headerlink" title="05Comic Bubbles MOGRT"></a>05<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?_ga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Comic Bubbles MOGRT</strong></a></h3><p>Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles’, kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that’s the kind of look that you’re looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic’ text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy’ text in between animated projects.</p>
<p>For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we’ve linked if you want to see it in action!)</p>
<h3 id="06Smoke-To-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#06Smoke-To-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="06Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>06<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?_ga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal’ is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the <strong>text motion graphics</strong> are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It’s perfect for those looking for underwater-themed <strong>text motion graphics</strong>. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.</p>
<p>This is <strong>Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro</strong>. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.</p>
<h3 id="07Text-Messages-Toolkit"><a href="#07Text-Messages-Toolkit" class="headerlink" title="07Text Messages Toolkit"></a>07<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?_ga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Text Messages Toolkit</strong></a></h3><p>Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit’ might be a fun <strong>text motion graphics</strong> for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it’s a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message’ interactions. It’s customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that’s what you want.</p>
<h3 id="08Large-Text-Title-Block"><a href="#08Large-Text-Title-Block" class="headerlink" title="08Large Text Title Block"></a>08<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/"><strong>Large Text Title Block</strong></a></h3><p>With the ‘large text title block’ template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you’re wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!</p>
<h3 id="09Blueprint-Titles"><a href="#09Blueprint-Titles" class="headerlink" title="09Blueprint Titles"></a>09<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?_ga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Blueprint Titles</strong></a></h3><p>Want something that’s a little quirkier? Or, perhaps, instructional? Then the ‘Blueprint Titles’ template is one that you can consider. As you can perhaps guess from the name, it allows you to create <strong>text motion graphics</strong> in a style that is similar to the kind of blueprints you usually see when working with design or architecture.</p>
<h3 id="10Dynamic-Minimalism"><a href="#10Dynamic-Minimalism" class="headerlink" title="10Dynamic Minimalism"></a>10<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://videohive.net/item/dynamic-minimalism-essential-graphics-mogrt/21637324?s_rank=16&_ga=2.111208772.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Dynamic Minimalism</strong></a></h3><p>Sometimes, simple really is best! And, this next template, the ‘Dynamic Minimalism’ <strong>text motion after effects</strong> and <strong>text motion graphics premiere pro</strong> template is one that you might want in your arsenal just for the sake of your simpler projects! The kit comes with 30 different animations, as well as other customization functions that you can play around with to add a little personality to what are otherwise very minimalistic designs.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script"><a href="#01Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img

                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img

                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images"><a href="#03Create-Images" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script-3"><a href="#01Write-a-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-5.jpg"
                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard-3"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard-3" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-6.jpg"
                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images-3"><a href="#03Create-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-7.jpg"
                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images-3"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-record-anime4.jpg"
                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h4 id="1-What-is-anime"><a href="#1-What-is-anime" class="headerlink" title="1. What is anime?"></a>1. What is anime?</h4><p>In Japan, anime refers to any animated cartoon, whereas outside Japan, it refers to cartoon videos made specifically in Japan. Anime is basically a hand or computer-drawn animated series. Owing to their gripping storylines, these series, as well as movies, have their separate fan base.

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-record-anime4.jpg"
                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-anime-video6.jpg"

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-record-anime4.jpg"
                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.</p>
<p>How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> Then, launch the application, tap the   <strong>‘import’</strong> button under the menu, select <strong>‘Import Media Files’</strong> and load the particular anime video to the media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg"
                      alt="import anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> Right-click on the video, tap <strong>‘Detach Audio’</strong>, and then delete the background audio from the track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-anime-video2.jpg"
                      alt="detach anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong> Then hit the <strong>‘Record Voiceover’</strong> button on the toolbar, connect a professional external microphone to record your customized narration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-anime-video3.jpg"
                      alt="record anime video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong> After the Record dialogue appears, tap the Red circle, wait for 3 seconds, and then start talking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-record-anime4.jpg"
                      alt="start anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong> Upon completion, the recorded audio will automatically on the timeline as well as in the Album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dub-anime-video5.jpg"
                      alt="finish anime dubbing"
                ></p>
<p>You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong> Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit <strong>‘Export’</strong> to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-anime-video6.jpg"
