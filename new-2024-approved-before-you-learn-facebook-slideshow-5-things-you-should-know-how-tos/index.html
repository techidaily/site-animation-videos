                      alt="click again to bring up the paste option "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: When the GIF appears, click Paste.</p>

                      alt="click paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: A preview of the GIF would appear on the text box. Hit Send when you’re ready to send the GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="tap send"
                ></p>
<p>If you use a GIF website other than GIPHY, the sent GIF may appear as a link rather than an image. If you’re okay with that, make sure the address of the shared animated image you end with the file extension, “.gif” if not, iMessage would not be able to load it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>

<p>GIFs add fun and humor to interactions via text messages. GIFs allow you to convey ideas, emotions, and thoughts in much more precise ways than an emoji would. iPhones operating on iOS 10 or later versions have an in-built GIF keyboard, making it super easy to add GIFs. iPhone text GIFs are readily accessible from GIF keyboards. Still, if you do not have one, you can resort to third-party applications like GIPHY and GIF keyboard for more prominent access to GIF libraries.</p>

Hence, we dedicated this part to teaching you how to use <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> to revitalize and better express yourself while texting.</p>
<p>On iPhone, there are two different ways to send iPhone text GIFs – employing the default keyboard or through the help of third-party apps. You can use the iOS default keyboard to search for GIFs in iMessage on iPhones directly. This applies to all iPhones running on iOS 10 and later versions. If your iPhone belongs to this category, follow the simple steps to add <strong>GIFs in text messages on iPhone</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard-3"><a href="#01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard-3" class="headerlink" title="01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard"></a>01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard</h3><p>Here’s how you can send <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> using the iOS default keyboard:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-3.jpg"
                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-5.jpg"
                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-6.jpg"
                      alt="select your desired GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Send icon, represented as a blue arrow icon, to send your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hit send"
                ></p>
<p>You can add comments to a GIF just before sending it on the iMessage app. Type a message under the GIF before clicking “Send” to get the comment delivered together with the GIF.</p>

<h3 id="03Fedex-3"><a href="#03Fedex-3" class="headerlink" title="03Fedex"></a>03Fedex</h3><p>Another logo that would classify as a flashy animated logo is the fedex logo. Initially, fedex had experimented with several logos before sticking to the arrow logo which continues even today. The animated logo involves an arrow making the letter “Fedex” with its trajectory and then finally settling in between letters X and E. The logistics giant delivers couriers from one corner of the world to another, and the arrow symbolizes exactly that!</p>
<h3 id="04Flickr-3"><a href="#04Flickr-3" class="headerlink" title="04Flickr"></a>04Flickr</h3><p>Flickr is a popular stock image and video hosting platform. Anyone can use the stock images and videos in their content. The logo starts with a blue and pink dot initially. These dots later expand in a whirlpool like motion. The logo starts off with the static logo before it expands. The idea is to show that the online stock image portal goes beyond limits and has every picture and video you’d need</p>
<h3 id="05Bundle-3"><a href="#05Bundle-3" class="headerlink" title="05Bundle"></a>05Bundle</h3><p>Bundle is a popular app that offers its users rewards upon shopping from selected stores. These stores have an alliance with bundle and upon shopping from them, users seek reward points on the bundle app. The animated logo starts of with a pink screen which later converges to become a large “B” wrapped with a gifting ribbon. Although, the logo is pretty simple it does an amazing job at explaining the brand’s MSP and attracts customers.</p>
<h3 id="06Google-3"><a href="#06Google-3" class="headerlink" title="06Google"></a>06Google</h3><p>The logo of google has evolved over the years. Google is almost synonymous to attractive logos and it comes up with attractive new logos every now and then. One of the newest logos, an animated one, is by far one of the most attractive animated logos. It aims to depict the numerous things users can search using “Google voice search”.</p>
