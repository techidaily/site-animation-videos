<p>It’s worth noting that people commonly use built-in <strong>OBS animated lower thirds</strong> for the job, but you can also use other editing tools to create custom animations and import them in your OBS Livestream.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about OBS animated lower thirds and their best alternatives you can use in 2022 and beyond.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-8"><a href="#In-this-article-8" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What are Lower Thirds in Animation?](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option?

As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>

It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>

As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>

It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>

<h3 id="05Adobe-Photoshop-3"><a href="#05Adobe-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="05Adobe Photoshop"></a>05Adobe Photoshop</h3><p><img

                      alt="Adobe Photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Before you act surprised, let us clarify that Adobe Photoshop isn’t an alternative to OBS Studio. However, you can use it to create customized overlays and lower-third graphics to add a personal touch to your live streams. Suppose you are already familiar with Photoshop and have been using it for a few years. In that case, it’ll allow you to design personalized text overlays, graphics, animations, and logos for your live streams.</p>
<p>And, once you have successfully designed the lower-third overlays, you can use any of the live stream managers to add them to your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Design custom overlays for your social media live streams</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photoshop has a steep learning curve, and if you are not an experienced designer, you won’t be able to design custom overlays</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Adobe Photoshop?</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop is a reliable choice for creators who find the built-in media libraries of a live stream manager limited. With Photoshop, you’ll be able to design custom overlays for your live streams.</p>
<h3 id="06ShareX-3"><a href="#06ShareX-3" class="headerlink" title="06ShareX"></a>06ShareX</h3><p><img

                      alt="ShareX"
                ></p>
<p>ShareX is also an open-source screen recorder and lives stream manager that offers all the OBS features you’ll need to manage your live streams and add multiple lower-third overlays. The only downside of ShareX is that it has a complicated user interface. Even if you have used OBS in the past, you’ll find ShareX’s user interface relatively complex. So, you should only sign up for ShareX if you are comfortable with complex user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Upload and save pictures, videos, logos for lower-third overlays</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Record your entire screen or a specific window</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Assign hotkeys to switch between multiple windows during the Livestream</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The user interface isn’t as friendly as other available options</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend ShareX?</strong></p>
<p>ShareX is an ideal <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> alternative for users who need a free-of-cost solution to manage their live streams.</p>
<h3 id="07Canva-3"><a href="#07Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="07Canva"></a>07Canva</h3><p><img

                      alt="Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Again, Canva doesn’t support live stream management at all. However, like Adobe Photoshop, you can use Canva to create stunning lower-third overlays for your Livestream sessions. The major benefit of using Canva is that it has thousands of pre-made templates that you can import to your design with one click. All these templates are fully customizable - so you’ll be able to design custom lower-third overlays for your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Comparatively less complicated than Adobe Photoshop</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Canva is affordable</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Being a web-based designing tool, you can access Canva on any device</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The premium version of Canva is relatively expensive than its competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Canva?</strong></p>
<p>Canva is a one-stop solution for content creators looking for an additional designing tool to create custom OBS animated lower thirds for their live streams.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> OBS animated lower-thirds are one of the most effective ways to share the context of a live stream with your viewers</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With OBS Studio, you have the liberty to import custom animated lower-third animations and overlays and add them to the live stream through its layered architecture</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apart from OBS Studio, there are several other tools (such as Wondershare Filmora Pro) to add animated lower-thirds to live streams.</p>

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement.

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging-2"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging-2" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning.

But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>

It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>

<p>When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to <strong>convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop</strong>, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. Its file format is a compressed image, and it is most suitable for animation. We all know that an animated GIF comprises a series of many still images. However, since these images play sequentially, it may appear as if they are in motion. It is that movement illusion that makes the animation effect come about.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size.

<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>

<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>

That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small.

<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Drag the videos to Filmora timeline</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that Filmora has a long list of tools you can use to edit your videos. However, you can also use them on a video that’s on its timeline. To drop them there, all you have to do is drag them to the timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Edit the File</strong></p>
<p>The list of ways of editing your videos is long. Some of your options are split, crop, combine, slow down, and speed up the GIFs, to mention a few. So, pick the options that fit your situation the best. Ensure that the end product is as good as possible by using these features to the best level.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Various Text Effects</strong></p>
<p>In most cases, images and videos aren’t enough. You may want to add text to enhance what you want to achieve with the GIF. To do so, you can always introduce text, and trust me, it never disappoints. In addition to text, you can also add sound at this stage. Again, it is something that does GIFs the justice they deserve.</p>

<p>When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to <strong>convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop</strong>, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. Its file format is a compressed image, and it is most suitable for animation. We all know that an animated GIF comprises a series of many still images. However, since these images play sequentially, it may appear as if they are in motion. It is that movement illusion that makes the animation effect come about.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png"
                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Add Text"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets"><a href="#01Step-2-Use-Animation-Presets" class="headerlink" title="01Step 2. Use Animation Presets"></a>01Step 2. Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation"><a href="#01Step-3-Per-Character-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01Step 3. Per-Character Animation"></a>01Step 3. Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles"><a href="#09Bold-Titles" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-4"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-4" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you don’t have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> SECRET TIP! If you’re looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It’s a video editor, first and foremost, but that’s not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>

Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>

Per-Character Animation</h3><p>If you’d like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)</p>
<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

<p>This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To animate text per layer, select ‘animate’ on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You’ll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.</p>

Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!</p>
<h3 id="01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-2"><a href="#01Real-3D-Light-Bulb-Kit-2" class="headerlink" title="01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit"></a>01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>The first Text Animation Template on our list is the “Logo Light Bulb” 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Text-Reveal-2"><a href="#023D-Text-Reveal-2" class="headerlink" title="023D Text Reveal"></a>023D Text Reveal</h3><p>This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.</p>
<h3 id="033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-2"><a href="#033D-Metallic-Text-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="033D Metallic Text Animation"></a>033D Metallic Text Animation</h3><p>Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.</p>
<h3 id="043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-2"><a href="#043D-Text-Box-Animation-Pack-2" class="headerlink" title="043D Text Box Animation Pack"></a>043D Text Box Animation Pack</h3><p>The next one is a little less ‘impressive’ — in the sense that it isn’t as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we’ve introduced thus far. And that’s exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its <strong>3D spinning text (after effects)</strong> elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.</p>
<h3 id="053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-2"><a href="#053D-Text-Logo-Boxes-2" class="headerlink" title="053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes"></a>053D Text &amp; Logo Boxes</h3><p>This next one, the 3D Text &amp; Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.</p>
<h3 id="06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-2"><a href="#06The-Light-Bulb-Kit-2" class="headerlink" title="06The Light Bulb Kit"></a>06The Light Bulb Kit</h3><p>Our next pick, which is the ‘Light Bulb Kit’ also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.</p>
<h3 id="073D-Text-Templates-2"><a href="#073D-Text-Templates-2" class="headerlink" title="073D Text Templates"></a>073D Text Templates</h3><p>The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It’s very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-2"><a href="#083D-Text-Shapes-Logo-Reveal-2" class="headerlink" title="083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal"></a>083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal</h3><p>The ‘3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal’ template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.</p>
<h3 id="09Bold-Titles-2"><a href="#09Bold-Titles-2" class="headerlink" title="09Bold Titles"></a>09Bold Titles</h3><p>The ‘Bold Titles’ template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.</p>
<h3 id="1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-2"><a href="#1010-Wave-3D-Logo-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text"></a>1010. Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text</h3><p>Looking for something simple and professional? Then the ‘Wave 3D Logo &amp; Text’ template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it’s actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they’re working on), should be able to get some use out of.</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-6"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-6" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you don’t have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> SECRET TIP! If you’re looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It’s a video editor, first and foremost, but that’s not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!</p>

<p>“Where is everyone getting their <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates?”</p>
<p>To answer this request, we’ve compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like <strong>3D Spinning Text (After Effects)</strong> but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.</p>

<p>03 [The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates](#Part 3)</p>
<p>04 [Secrets to Learning More Animation Tactics](#Part 4)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-3D-Text-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?"></a>Part 1 What’s 3D Text Animation?</h2><p>Before anything else, let’s talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you’re reading now, is 2D Text. It’s static, and it lacks depth. It’s just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it’s almost tangible. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png"
                      alt="3D Text Example Yay"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.</p>
<p>Now, you’ll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or <strong>3D text logo animation</strong>. They’re eye-catching, and because they’re 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-Make-3D-Text-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will teach you how to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong> in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You’ll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create <strong>3D Text Animation</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Add-Your-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Add Your Text"></a>01Step 1. Add Your Text</h3><p>The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the ‘Tools’ panel, select the Type tool, and then select the ‘Composition’ panel. The composition is where you type your text!</p>
<p>With After Effects, you also have the following options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Change Text Font</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Size</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust Text Color</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)</p>
<p>And so on! Once you’re done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.</p>

Use Animation Presets</h3><p>With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you’ve practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.</p>
<p>These can be found by selecting ‘Browse Presets…’ on the ‘Animation’ tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.</p>
<p>Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you’ve adjusted that accordingly.</p>
