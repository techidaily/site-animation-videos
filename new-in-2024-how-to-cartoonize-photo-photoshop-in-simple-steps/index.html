Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool"><a href="#01Brush-Tool" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool"><a href="#03Pen-Tool" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-1"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-1"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-1" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-1"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-2"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-2"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-2" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-2"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-3"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-3"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-3" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-3"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva"><a href="#2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?"></a>2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?</h3><p>Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva"><a href="#2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?"></a>2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?</h3><p>Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-2"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva-2"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture.

<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>

The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>

<p>If what you’re searching for is a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-20"><a href="#In-this-article-20" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs"><a href="#Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs"></a>Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs</h2><p>First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools and <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-4"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-4" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>The first <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.</p>
<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Launch Filmora Video Editor"></a>01Step 1: Launch <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>First things first, launch the <strong>3D GIF maker</strong> that you intend to use. In our case, that is Filmora (a screenshot has been provided below for your edification and reference. We’ll be using Filmora as our example.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media &gt; Import Media File. However, you can also drag and drop your file(s) on the designated area of the UI..</p>

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>
<p>And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.</p>

<p>This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.</p>

<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>

With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Launch Filmora Video Editor"></a>01Step 1: Launch <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>First things first, launch the <strong>3D GIF maker</strong> that you intend to use. In our case, that is Filmora (a screenshot has been provided below for your edification and reference. We’ll be using Filmora as our example.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media &gt; Import Media File. However, you can also drag and drop your file(s) on the designated area of the UI..</p>

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>
<p>And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.</p>

<p>This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.</p>
