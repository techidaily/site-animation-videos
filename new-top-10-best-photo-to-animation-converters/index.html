This software is highly-rated online and it comes with a bunch of presets, filters, and effects, that you can use in order to animate your photographs. Its more advanced video editing functions would no doubt prove to be useful in the future as well, allowing you to increase the complexity of your projects and achieve more and more things.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With Filmora, you have access to a built-in library of Effects and Elements that you can use in order to make animated pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The advanced video editing functions can also be used to create more complex motion animations that you are unlikely to see in other alternatives.</p>

<p>When it comes to <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

<p>The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an <strong>online photo animator</strong> and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.</p>

<p>Photo Cartoon is an <strong>online photo animator</strong> that specifically alters your photos and ‘cartoon-izes’ it (with several effects to choose from as to the specific style that you want). This single-use, while definitely not the most advanced on this list of ours, offers the user an easy way to change the look of their photographs.</p>

<p>With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools. This one works quite simply as well though. Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a cartoon version of your images easily and quickly.</p>

The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

<p>The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an <strong>online photo animator</strong> and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Comes with a veritable library of templates, effects, and filters for advanced photo editing and photo animation.</p>

To create these GIF stickers for WhatsApp, you would need the help of third-party apps.</p>
<p>For Android devices, one such popular app is the Sticker Maker app. For iPhone, we suggest using Sticker Maker Studio app.</p>
<p>Once these apps are installed on your device, GIF stickers can be made in no time.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to make sticker GIF WhatsApp on Android phone</strong></p>
<p>Step 1. Download, install and open the Sticker maker app on your Android device.</p>
<p>Step 2. Tap on the “Create a new sticker pack” option on your app.</p>
<p>Step 3. Give the desired name to your sticker pack and click on the Create button.</p>
<p>Step 4. To add the animated stickers, click on the created sticker pack.</p>
<p>Step 5. Next, click on the first box, and then from the menu choose the Select file option.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 6. Next, choose the video from your phone from which you wish to create a sticker. You can even add a GIF file. After the media file is added, the app will compress it and will turn it into an animated sticker automatically.</p>
<p>Step 7. Now, you need to add 3 animated stickers to the other boxes of the sticker app (as mentioned in step 5).</p>
<p>Note: Multiple stickers can be added using the same process.</p>
<p>Step 8. Click on the “Add to WhatsApp” button after a minimum of 3 stickers are added to the pack.</p>
<p>Step 9. Now, your stickers are ready. Open the WhatsApp chat and launch the sticker panel where you can see your created GIF stickers. Choose the sticker you want, add it to your chat, and send it.</p>

<p>Note: If you see your tray icon to be blank, click on it else there will be issues adding the stickers to the WhatsApp chat later. A tray icon can be selected from the images.</p>
<p>Step 7. Next, you will be asked if you wish to open WhatsApp, click on Okay.</p>
<p>Step 8. Now, to add the animated GIF stickers to WhatsApp, you need to click on the Save button and your stickers are ready to be used in the chat.</p>
