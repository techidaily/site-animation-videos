Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

Custom colors</h3><p>A cool feature that you can find on pencil 2d animation software is the custom color one. You can merge and mix colors according to your choice and create your own color. To do so, you need to click on the small color box that you’ll find at the top right of your screen. By doing so, a huge color wheel will appear on your screen. Now you can either enter values of the R, G, and B if you wish to merge different colors and make a new one or select a particular color from the huge color wheel that appears in front of you. These colors vary in gradient, shade, and a lot of different factors.</p>

The Undo button</h3><p>The Undo button is a highly useful functionality for the lazy ones who do not wish to erase the mistake they made. By undoing, the previous step gets reverted and you can start over again. The traditional undo shortcut, Ctrl+Z does work in the pencil 2d animation. Alternatively, you can also use the undo feature via the user interface. You can do so by heading over to the edit option in the topmost bar. The first option in the drop-down menu would be undo.</p>

By turning on the bitmap, pencil 2d animation ensures that you’ve no blank frames at the start of your animation.</p>

Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Take a photo</strong></p>
<p>Start your Snapchat app as usual and snap a photo or video.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tap the Sticker icon</strong></p>
<p>From the row on the right side of the screen, tap the Sticker icon.</p>
<p>To add a GIF to your photo or video, scroll down and select one. You can also use the search option to locate more particular GIFs by entering a term or phrase.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="tap sticker icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag GIF</strong></p>
<p>Drag the GIF you added to the screen’s desired location.</p>
<p>Pinch your screen to change the GIF’s size as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save and Share</strong></p>
<p>You can then share your Snap with other social networking platforms by sending it to your Stories, friends&#x2F;contacts, or just saving it to your gallery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-6.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p>You can use the same snap to apply many stickers. Drag and drop it on the trashcan icon to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get Gboard on your Android device if it didn’t come with it:</p>
<p>• Download the Gboard from the Play Store or whichever playstore you want.</p>
<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>
<p>• Double-check that Gboard is selected as your primary keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, grant any permissions it requires so that you can use it right away in Snapchat.</p>
<p>Now that it’s as simple as it gets, let’s send comparable GIFs utilizing iOS devices.</p>
<p>For iPhone&#x2F;iPad:</p>
<p>For iPhone users, you must first download and install the giphy app on your phone. Once you have successfully set the giphy app as your default keyboard, you can send <strong>Snapchat GIFs</strong> chat by following the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Press the Globe icon</strong></p>
<p>Continuously press and hold the globe icon to the left of the space bar to reveal the available keyboard, then choose a specific or favorite GIF from the giphy list.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Find GIF</strong></p>
<p>Find the GIF you wish to send and tap it to copy it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-8.jpg.png"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Paste GIF</strong></p>
<p>Return to the conversation, paste the GIF into the text box, and press the send button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p>For those who don’t know how to use the Giphy app on their iPhones or iPads, read the following instructions:</p>
<p>• Go to the Settings menu and pick the General icon.</p>
<p>•To see your keyboard options, go to the keyboard setting and tap it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>

<p>Make or open an existing design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit to choose the page, element, or text box that you wish to animate.</li>
<li>Once you hit the Animate tab above the editor on the toolbar, you will see the displayed options on the side panel.</li>
<li>Please hover your mouse over it to preview an option. Then, you’ll see your design animate.</li>
<li>Click on it to apply.</li>
<li>For pages: To control the animation timing, click to select the page, and then click on the stopwatch icon above the editor.</li>
<li>Download your design in GIF or video format.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also directly share them on social media or schedule them for later.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Steps-to-create-animated-social-media-videos-in-Canva-3"><a href="#Part-4-Steps-to-create-animated-social-media-videos-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Steps to create animated social media videos in Canva"></a>Part 4 Steps to create animated social media videos in Canva</h2><h3 id="1-Select-your-template-3"><a href="#1-Select-your-template-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Select your template"></a>1. Select your template</h3><p>Sign in to Canva, then choose and make your social media story template. There are two vastly different ways to explore this: You can either select “Create a design” at the top or go for a particular template to get the ideal dimensions.</p>
<h3 id="2-Animate-your-video-3"><a href="#2-Animate-your-video-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Animate your video"></a>2. Animate your video</h3><p>Here’s where the fun begins! Now that you are ready to start editing your selected template, you can add animated and unique elements to your story in three various ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a video</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re ready to add in your video once you’ve chosen your template! Upload or select any video you might want to use and drag it into a placeholder on your story chosen template. If needed, adjust the size and positioning until it fits.</p>
<ul>
<li>Animated design elements</li>
</ul>
<p>Another option to animate your social media posts videos is through the Elements feature in Canva by choosing the “Stickers” tab.</p>
<p>You can either enter your requirement in the search bar or scroll through Canva’s huge graphics and enter “animated {insert the word you’re searching for, i.e., lines, arrows}. Then, you can drag and drop them right into your design.</p>
<p>There are specific search terms for your reference: Animated Sparkle, Animated Arrow, Animated Word, and Animated Line.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Animate button.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s an “Animate” button you’ll see at the top when you’re in your design. Hit on the page you wish to animate, and the Animate tab will pop up on the top left.</p>
<p>Use these three features to create an animated video individually or all together – they’ll be sure to up-level your stories in a fun and unique way.</p>
<h3 id="3-Preview-and-Download-3"><a href="#3-Preview-and-Download-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Preview and Download"></a>3. Preview and Download</h3><p>You can preview your animated stories once you finish the action by hitting the “Play” tab at the top of your screen.</p>
