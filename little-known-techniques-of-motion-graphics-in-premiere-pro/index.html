<h2 id="Part-1-5-Editing-Motion-Graphics-Techniques-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-5-Editing-Motion-Graphics-Techniques-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 5 Editing Motion Graphics Techniques in Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1 5 Editing Motion Graphics Techniques in Adobe Premiere Pro</h2><p>A variety of editing techniques of <strong>motion graphics for Premiere Pro</strong> are ready to give a classy touch to your videos. Let’s brush up through the best you can have.</p>
<h3 id="01Cropping-Clips"><a href="#01Cropping-Clips" class="headerlink" title="01Cropping Clips"></a>01Cropping Clips</h3><p>Cropping your videos allows you to fit them into your required size frames. To remove any unwanted portions of your edits, crop them in adobe Premiere Pro with your desired aspect ratio to give that ‘just perfect’ look to your edits.</p>
<p>Start from importing and adding your footage to your project panel, followed by creating a fresh composition. Now, choose ‘Crop’ from the Effects panel to add it to your clip, either by double-clicking or dragging and dropping.</p>
<h3 id="02Trimming-Clips"><a href="#02Trimming-Clips" class="headerlink" title="02Trimming Clips"></a>02Trimming Clips</h3><p>If you want to adjust the ‘In and Out’ play back sequence of your edited clips, you can go for trimming them. You can trim your clips in the Source and Program monitors, or even in the Premiere Pro timeline. You can choose from the standard cut, jump cut, B-roll cut etc, to suit your editing needs and styles.</p>
<p>All you need to do is open the clip, mark the In and Out points, adjust their sequence with previous or next edits in your cue and that’s it. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for this purpose. However, you need to preset these shortcuts before you begin editing your clips.</p>
<h3 id="03Adding-Text"><a href="#03Adding-Text" class="headerlink" title="03Adding Text"></a>03Adding Text</h3><p>You can try adding simple and formatted texts to enhance your video outlook. This comes handy when you are aiming to deliver specific messages to your audience. You can add normal write-ups, callout quotations and customize your text in a number of exciting styles. Just go to the Type tool, format your text in the Text Box and you’re done!</p>
<h3 id="04Audio-Level-Adjustment"><a href="#04Audio-Level-Adjustment" class="headerlink" title="04Audio Level Adjustment"></a>04Audio Level Adjustment</h3><p>Want to add spark to your clips with a synchronized audio visual effect? After you finish trimming and cropping, consider opting for an in-line audio adjustment. This will definitely enhance your video and take your craft to the next level.</p>
<p>All you need to do is select an audio clip, click on ‘Audio Gain’ in the drop down menu, set desired Decibel count in the Audio Gain Box and select ‘OK’.</p>
<h3 id="05Exporting-Videos"><a href="#05Exporting-Videos" class="headerlink" title="05Exporting Videos"></a>05Exporting Videos</h3><p>Once you are done with your video craft, you should certainly look forward to making it available for social exposure. To do this, select appropriate sequence constraints in the Export window, choose the export platform, format and Codec, make fine tuning and bit rate adjustments and finish export either in Premiere Pro or Media Encoder. You may also save these settings for your next exports.</p>

To remove any unwanted portions of your edits, crop them in adobe Premiere Pro with your desired aspect ratio to give that ‘just perfect’ look to your edits.</p>
<p>Start from importing and adding your footage to your project panel, followed by creating a fresh composition. Now, choose ‘Crop’ from the Effects panel to add it to your clip, either by double-clicking or dragging and dropping.</p>
<h3 id="02Trimming-Clips-1"><a href="#02Trimming-Clips-1" class="headerlink" title="02Trimming Clips"></a>02Trimming Clips</h3><p>If you want to adjust the ‘In and Out’ play back sequence of your edited clips, you can go for trimming them. You can trim your clips in the Source and Program monitors, or even in the Premiere Pro timeline. You can choose from the standard cut, jump cut, B-roll cut etc, to suit your editing needs and styles.</p>
<p>All you need to do is open the clip, mark the In and Out points, adjust their sequence with previous or next edits in your cue and that’s it. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for this purpose. However, you need to preset these shortcuts before you begin editing your clips.</p>

The reason being 2D animations have a lower production cost and they still offer complete liberty over creativity.

In layman’s terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can’t be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).</p>
<p>Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it’s always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it’s also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You’ll have to be extra cautious while picking through the <strong>best 2D animation studios</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Time-Does-It-Take-to-Create-a-2D-Animation-Video"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Time-Does-It-Take-to-Create-a-2D-Animation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Much Time Does It Take to Create a 2D Animation Video?"></a>Part 2 How Much Time Does It Take to Create a 2D Animation Video?</h2><p>Due to their immense popularity in the marketing world, many business owners and marketers want to know how much time it takes to create a 2D animation video. Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated <strong>2D animation company</strong>, you’ll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don’t know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.</p>

In layman’s terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can’t be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).</p>
<p>Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it’s always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it’s also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You’ll have to be extra cautious while picking through the <strong>best 2D animation studios</strong>.</p>

Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated <strong>2D animation company</strong>, you’ll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don’t know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.</p>
