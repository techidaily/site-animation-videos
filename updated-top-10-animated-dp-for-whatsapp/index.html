Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool"><a href="#01Brush-Tool" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool"><a href="#03Pen-Tool" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results.

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-1"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-1"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-1" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-1"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-2"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-2"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-2" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-2"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-3"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-3"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-3" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool-3"><a href="#03Pen-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

To proceed with color application, navigate to the toolbar at the left of the Photoshop workspace and choose the ‘Brush Tool’.

<p>Navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel again and create a new ‘Gradient’ layer to further enhance your creation.
