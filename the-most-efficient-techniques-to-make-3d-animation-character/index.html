<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>

You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>

                ></p>

It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-1"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-1"><a href="#2-1-Image-1" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-2-Text-1"><a href="#2-2-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-3"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-3"><a href="#2-1-Image-3" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"
                      alt="Canva page animations"
                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text-3"><a href="#2-2-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video-3"><a href="#2-3-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>

This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: “learning.” Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician’s assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.</p>
<p>Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of <strong>cartoon character drawing</strong> and practice some <strong>easy, simple cartoon drawing</strong> before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw cartoons characters"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you’re going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.</p>
<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to sketch drawing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>

Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: “learning.” Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician’s assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.</p>
<p>Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of <strong>cartoon character drawing</strong> and practice some <strong>easy, simple cartoon drawing</strong> before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw cartoons characters"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-3"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you’re going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.</p>
<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

Plus how to cartoon yourself with it"></a>Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it</h2><p>We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.</p>

                      alt="voila ai artist"
                ></p>
<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>

Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.</p>
<p>There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.</p>

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

Plus how to cartoon yourself with it"></a>Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it</h2><p>We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="voila ai artist"
                ></p>
<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-make-3D-Cartoon-From-a-Photo-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-make-3D-Cartoon-From-a-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo"></a>Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo</h2><p>Photoshop is no doubt one of the most influential digital assets that allow you to do virtually anything with your photos. Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.</p>
<p>There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.</p>

                      alt="create 3d cartoon photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>
