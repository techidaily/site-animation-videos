From informative articles to explanatory videos, you can find useful and need specific content in a diversity of ways. While reading does not sound a convenient cup of tea to most of us, videos are something more preferable.</p>
<p>When looking through descriptive solutions that could affordably serve your purpose, explanatory videos are the handiest choices owing to the ‘see and learn’ flexibility they provide viewers with. However, what attract more concern is, how to save these videos to your device. After all, you would never want to lose a useful video and most of us, of course have data pricing and usage limitations.</p>
<p>Online video downloader tools are certainly the most widely preferred and trusted solutions to the aforesaid concerns, and why not, they claim a range of choice benefits. Some of the obvious benefits of using these tools are listed below:</p>

Whether looking through informative content or just as an entertainment choice, videos with frequent buffering intervals are always disapproving.

<h3 id="02Information-Sharing"><a href="#02Information-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="02Information Sharing"></a>02Information Sharing</h3><p>Living within a bunch of social media platforms and utilities, content sharing has become more of a habit than a requisite need.

<p>Till now, you learned about how to animate a picture on Canva. Now, let’s comprehend the right way to use Filmora for animating and adding images in the video.</p>
<p>Before using, make sure to update the software to its latest version. Follow separate methods for both Windows and Mac.</p>
<h3 id="For-Win-3"><a href="#For-Win-3" class="headerlink" title="For Win"></a>For Win</h3><h4 id="Step-1：-Adding-Image-to-Video-Track-3"><a href="#Step-1：-Adding-Image-to-Video-Track-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1： Adding Image to Video Track"></a>Step 1： Adding Image to Video Track</h4><p>With Filmora, adding images to video is a matter of seconds! Start by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the position where you want to add the image and place the Playhead there.</li>
<li>Right-click on the picture from the media library. Click on the “Insert” option. Your image will be added. Select the “Append” option, if you want to add an image at the video end.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-3.JPG"
                      alt="Adding Image to Video Track"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: How to Remove Black Bars around the Image?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to “Settings” from the File section.</li>
<li>Click on the “Editing” tab and select “Photo Placement.”</li>
<li>Choose from the “Crop to Fit” or “Pan To Zoom” option. The black bars will be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add the image in between the video clip, split them. Now, add the image between the split parts.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2：-Add-Images-as-Overlays-3"><a href="#Step-2：-Add-Images-as-Overlays-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2： Add Images as Overlays"></a>Step 2： Add Images as Overlays</h4><p>To add images as overlays, drag the image to a video track above the main track. The main track consists of your video.</p>
<p>Track 1 (or the track with a video clip) is the base of your video. If you add anything else, it will be displayed above this track as video track 2, 3, and so on. Overall, you can add 100 video tracks.</p>
<h4 id="Step-3：-Edit-Your-Image-3"><a href="#Step-3：-Edit-Your-Image-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3： Edit Your Image"></a>Step 3： Edit Your Image</h4><p>If you know how to animate an image in Canva, editing images on Filmora is even easier. You can try the following methods:</p>
<p><strong>Animate Your Images</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To add animation presets to the image, click on the image twice.</li>
<li>Go to the “Animation Tab” and look for an animation preset.</li>
<li>Drag the presets to the image for its effect</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-4.JPG"
                      alt="Animate Your Images"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Make Image Color Adjustments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the image</li>
<li>Go to the “Color” tab and then the “Color” section</li>
<li>Customize the temperature, saturation, brightness, etc., as per your need.</li>
<li>Press Ok.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change Image Duration</strong></p>
<p>You can increase the image duration to more than the default timing of 5 seconds. For that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the image and select the “Duration” option.</li>
<li>Go to the “Duration Setting” panel.</li>
<li>Add the new duration timing.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="Change Image Duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Adjust Position, Rotate&#x2F;Flip, and Opacity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can resize the image position through the circles and squares at the image edges.</li>
<li>To flip or rotate the image, double-click on the picture. From the “Image Panel,” go to “Transform” and then click on “Rotate.” You can choose either “Horizontal Flip” or “Vertical Flip” to flip the images.</li>
<li>Double-click on the image and click on the “Composting” option to add opacity. You can choose the blending mode or adjust the “Opacity” accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-6.JPG" alt="Adjust Position Rotate/Flip and Opacity"></p>
<h3 id="For-Mac-3"><a href="#For-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="For Mac"></a>For Mac</h3><p>Filmora for Mac comes with a drag and drop feature to add transitions, animated titles, and effects. You can start a new project from scratch by clicking on “New Project”. The entire process is the same as that for Windows users.</p>
<p>To apply animation in the images, use the motion effects option. For that,</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Image</li>
<li>Go to Motion Tab</li>
<li>Select a motion effect</li>
<li>Double-click to apply the effect</li>
</ul>
