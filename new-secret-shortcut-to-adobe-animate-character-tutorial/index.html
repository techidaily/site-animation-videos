<h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?"></a>Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?</h2><h3 id="1-Start-With-a-Script"><a href="#1-Start-With-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg"
                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

However, many beginners want to know if it’s easy to use Adobe character animator. The answer is Yes! With Character Animator, Adobe has developed a relatively easy-to-use interface that anyone can use easily.</p>

<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character-1"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script"><a href="#01Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images"><a href="#03Create-Images" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script-1"><a href="#01Write-a-Script-1" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img

                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard-1"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard-1" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img

                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images-1"><a href="#03Create-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images-1"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images-1" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-1"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard-2"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard-2" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>

<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Apply Filter-Sharpen</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter to sharpen the image. Select the Gaussian Blur from the Remove drop-down list</p>
<p>Press OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Apply Filter-Stylize</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter, then apply stylization and Oil paint.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select Image</strong></p>
<p>Now, choose an image you want to cartoonize.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-12.jpg"
                      alt="select image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Apply Filter-Sharpen</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter to sharpen the image. Select the Gaussian Blur from the Remove drop-down list</p>
<p>Press OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-13.jpg"
                      alt="apply filter-sharpen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Apply Filter-Stylize</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter, then apply stylization and Oil paint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-14.jpg"
                      alt="apply filter-stylize"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Choose Poster Edges</strong></p>
<p>Choose from the list of effects on the filter gallery, click on Poster Edges and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-15.jpg"
                      alt="choose poster edges"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Blur</strong></p>
<p>It will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 15 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels. This effect gives the skin a considerably smoother and cleaner appearance. Select OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-16.jpg"
                      alt="blur"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Unsharp Mask</strong></p>
<p>You can add some sharpness and increase particular highlights by going to Filter &gt; Sharpen &gt; Unsharp Mask.</p>
<p>Unhide the second Smart Object layer and change its blending mode to Overlay. Then, reduce the layer’s Opacity to 55 percent.</p>
<p>Now, it will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 12 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-17.jpg"
                      alt="unsharp mask"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Apply the Oil paint filter again</strong></p>
<p>Return to Filter &gt; Filter Gallery and select Poster Edges once more. These will draw attention to certain aspects of the portrait.</p>
<p>Choose the Oil Paint Filter from Filter &gt; Stylize. Select OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-18.jpg"
                      alt="apply oil pain filter again"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Double-click on Filter Gallery</strong></p>
<p>Click OK after double-clicking the Filter Gallery Smart Filter already on this layer.</p>
<p>Carry on with the same steps for the Oil Paint Filter.</p>
<p>Select OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-19.jpg"
                      alt="double-clicking filter gallery"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Choose the Raw filter option</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take this <strong>photo cartoon effect</strong> to the next level with a simple method! To make a Stamp Visible Layer, choose the very top layer and press Control-Shift-Alt-E. When you wish to merge all the layers in a document onto a new layer, this shortcut comes in handy.</p>
<p>Lastly, convert the new layer to a Smart Object by right-clicking on it.</p>
<p>Select the Camera Raw Filter option from the Filter menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
