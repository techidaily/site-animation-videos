<h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?"></a>Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?</h2><h3 id="1-Start-With-a-Script"><a href="#1-Start-With-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg"
                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover-2"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character-2"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking.

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily.

This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<h3 id="05Express-Animate-2"><a href="#05Express-Animate-2" class="headerlink" title="05Express Animate"></a>05Express Animate</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $60 (full license)</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software.

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking.

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use!

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions!

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.</strong></h2><p>This is a series for people who want to learn how to create <strong>3D blender animation</strong> characters from keeping a reference image. Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>

Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>

We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>
