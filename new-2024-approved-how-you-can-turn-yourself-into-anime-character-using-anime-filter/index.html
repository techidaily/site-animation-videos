However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg"
                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>
<p>Filter URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.douyin.com/" >https://www.douyin.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #4: Anime Eyes</strong></p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>
<h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat filter</p>

                      alt="Cartoon Lens on Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

<p><strong>Anime Filter #9: Comics Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Comics Style Lens from Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>Again, we’re moving towards a different kind of animation style with this next filter from Snapchat, but the Comics Style filter does have its own promises of fun as well Especially for those who are long-time fans of American comics (or, even, your average modern-day Avengers fan)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-1"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg"
                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-12"><a href="#Pros-12" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-12"><a href="#Cons-12" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-13"><a href="#Pros-13" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-13"><a href="#Cons-13" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-14"><a href="#Pros-14" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-14"><a href="#Cons-14" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

                      alt="Cartoon Lens on Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

                ></p>
<p>Again, we’re moving towards a different kind of animation style with this next filter from Snapchat, but the Comics Style filter does have its own promises of fun as well Especially for those who are long-time fans of American comics (or, even, your average modern-day Avengers fan)</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, this might get confusing, but for our last picks, we actually have a set of filters all called <strong>Cartoon 3D Style</strong> But trust us They’re all different This first version is one you would probably relate more to the DreamWorks motion picture, Ratatouille</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-2"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-24"><a href="#Pros-24" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-24"><a href="#Cons-24" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-25"><a href="#Pros-25" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>

<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-26"><a href="#Pros-26" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-26"><a href="#Cons-26" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-2"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-2" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>

<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg"
                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-36"><a href="#Pros-36" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-36"><a href="#Cons-36" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-37"><a href="#Pros-37" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-37"><a href="#Cons-37" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-38"><a href="#Pros-38" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-38"><a href="#Cons-38" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

                      alt="Cartoon Lens on Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

<p><strong>Anime Filter #9: Comics Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Comics Style Lens from Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>Again, we’re moving towards a different kind of animation style with this next filter from Snapchat, but the Comics Style filter does have its own promises of fun as well Especially for those who are long-time fans of American comics (or, even, your average modern-day Avengers fan)</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, this might get confusing, but for our last picks, we actually have a set of filters all called <strong>Cartoon 3D Style</strong> But trust us They’re all different This first version is one you would probably relate more to the DreamWorks motion picture, Ratatouille</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

If your brand is for senior citizens, the animations will be different. Most importantly, if your brand shifts its audience genre, animations can also be created in the genre that you are choosing to serve at present.

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them?

                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you’re going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.</p>
<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>

                      alt="how to sketch drawing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker.

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-2"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment.

<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you’re going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.</p>
<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>

                      alt="how to sketch drawing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>
<p>The value you insert into the <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> box is based upon the number of frames your video contains.

<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>

<p>Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora’s Media tab. Moreover, you should also import all audio files you would like to use in your project before doing any actual editing. When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.</p>
<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>
<p>The value you insert into the <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn’t let you minimize a project’s frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04.</p>
<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2. Create a Storyboard"></a>02<strong>Step 2. Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Draw-Characters"><a href="#03Step-3-Draw-Characters" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Draw Characters"></a>03<strong>Step 3. Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

<h3 id="04Step-4-Put-Together-Project"><a href="#04Step-4-Put-Together-Project" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4. Put Together Project"></a>04<strong>Step 4. Put Together Project</strong></h3><p>Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That’s also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go</p>
<p>In the image below, we’re only showing the start of a potential project. We’ve only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video</p>

<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-8"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-8" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more. Be warned, it’s not the kind of project you should go into if you’re not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Still, there’s something satisfying about a well-done <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.</p>

<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-11"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-11" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more. Be warned, it’s not the kind of project you should go into if you’re not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Still, there’s something satisfying about a well-done <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.</p>
