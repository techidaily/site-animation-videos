<p>Rigging is a technology that is not known to everyone. However, an animation freak must know the technology in depth.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works"><a href="#Part-1-Do-You-Understand-How-Auto-Rig-Mapping-Works" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?"></a>Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?</h2><p>The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Rig Mapping"
                ></p>
<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

<p>Mango animate character animation maker is an amazing software that can perform the task of animation in a very simple manner.

The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.</p>

                      alt="Rig Mapping"
                ></p>
<p>For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.</p>
<p>The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.</p>

It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life"><a href="#02Observe-real-life" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>

<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?</h2><p><strong>2D animation</strong> is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life-1"><a href="#02Observe-real-life-1" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key-1"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key-1" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important-1"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important-1" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-1"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-1"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-3"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<p>We do have some recommendations for you. Even more than that, we’ve compiled a comprehensive guide on <strong>stop motion movies</strong> in hopes of introducing this often-forgotten art to those that may have never thought to appreciate it before.</p>
<p>Complete with an introduction, some examples of great <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> and a peek at what the process is usually like for the professionals working on said movies.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Movies-Use-Stop-Motion-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-Movies-Use-Stop-Motion-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?</strong></h2><p>First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-a-Stop-Motion-Movie"><a href="#01What-is-a-Stop-Motion-Movie" class="headerlink" title="01What is a Stop Motion Movie?"></a>01<strong>What is a Stop Motion Movie?</strong></h3><p>The best way to introduce the concept of <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.</p>
<p>It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it’s the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing ‘motion’ by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.</p>
<h3 id="02What-is-the-Most-Successful-Stop-Motion-Movie"><a href="#02What-is-the-Most-Successful-Stop-Motion-Movie" class="headerlink" title="02What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?"></a>02<strong>What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?</strong></h3><p>There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever <strong>stop motion movie</strong> to be made? Which was “The Humpty Dumpty Circus” created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter’s dolls.</p>
<p>You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the “Nightmare Before Christmas” or “Rudolph the Reindeer.” And finally. You have “Chicken Run” which is considered the best performing <strong>stop motion movie</strong> of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Popular-Stop-Motion-Movies-You-Might-Wonder"><a href="#Part-2-Popular-Stop-Motion-Movies-You-Might-Wonder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder"></a>Part 2 <strong>Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder</strong></h2><p>Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?</p>
<h3 id="01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies"><a href="#01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies" class="headerlink" title="01Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>01<strong>Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with <strong>Lego Movie stop motion</strong> animation. This <strong>stop motion movie</strong> animation style, also called ‘Brickfilms’, is the practice of using Lego to create <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong>. It’s been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.</p>
<p>It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies"><a href="#023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies" class="headerlink" title="023D Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>02<strong>3D Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Alright, so how about 3D <strong>stop motion movies</strong>? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it’s actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).</p>
<p>In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called “Tune with Tomorrow” but you might be more familiar with the title “Coraline.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films"><a href="#Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films</strong></h2><p>Now for our list of the best <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.</p>
<h3 id="01Coraline-2009"><a href="#01Coraline-2009" class="headerlink" title="01Coraline (2009)"></a>01<strong>Coraline (2009)</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this <strong>stop motion movie</strong> previously, but in case you haven’t already watched it, it’s a classic. The storytelling elements of “Coraline” really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn’t all that it was chalked up to be.</p>
<h3 id="02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993"><a href="#02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993" class="headerlink" title="02The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)"></a>02<strong>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</strong></h3><p>“The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993) is another <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington’s obsession with ruining Christmas.</p>
<h3 id="03Chicken-Run-1994"><a href="#03Chicken-Run-1994" class="headerlink" title="03Chicken Run (1994)"></a>03<strong>Chicken Run (1994)</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>stop motion movie</strong>, called “Chicken Run” (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.</p>
<h3 id="04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009"><a href="#04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009" class="headerlink" title="04Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)"></a>04<strong>Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)</strong></h3><p>The next film, released in the same year as “Coraline”, is called “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, ‘Mr. Fox’ and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.</p>
<h3 id="05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964"><a href="#05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964" class="headerlink" title="05Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)"></a>05<strong>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)</strong></h3><p>Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.</p>
<h3 id="06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016"><a href="#06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016" class="headerlink" title="06Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)"></a>06<strong>Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)</strong></h3><p>From the makers of Coraline is the <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>, called “Kubo and The Two Strings” (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It’s quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.</p>
<h3 id="07Alice-1988"><a href="#07Alice-1988" class="headerlink" title="07Alice (1988)"></a>07<strong>Alice (1988)</strong></h3><p>This next stop motion film is quite unique. It’s called “Alice” and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.</p>
<h3 id="088-Mary-and-Max-2009"><a href="#088-Mary-and-Max-2009" class="headerlink" title="088. Mary and Max (2009)"></a>08<strong>8. Mary and Max (2009)</strong></h3><p>Another <strong>stop motion movie</strong> that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called “Mary and Max.” This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.</p>
<h3 id="09The-Little-Prince-2016"><a href="#09The-Little-Prince-2016" class="headerlink" title="09The Little Prince (2016)"></a>09<strong>The Little Prince (2016)</strong></h3><p>Categorizing this film as ‘stop motion’ one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn’t detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of “The Little Prince.”</p>
<h3 id="10Frankenweenie-2012"><a href="#10Frankenweenie-2012" class="headerlink" title="10Frankenweenie (2012)"></a>10<strong>Frankenweenie (2012)</strong></h3><p>Another classic that you might recognize is “Frankenweenie” which was released in 2012. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movie"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movie" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie</strong></h2><p>For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised ‘tutorial’.

<p>In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.</p>

This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-a-Stop-Motion-Movie-1"><a href="#01What-is-a-Stop-Motion-Movie-1" class="headerlink" title="01What is a Stop Motion Movie?"></a>01<strong>What is a Stop Motion Movie?</strong></h3><p>The best way to introduce the concept of <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.</p>
<p>It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it’s the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing ‘motion’ by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.</p>
<h3 id="02What-is-the-Most-Successful-Stop-Motion-Movie-1"><a href="#02What-is-the-Most-Successful-Stop-Motion-Movie-1" class="headerlink" title="02What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?"></a>02<strong>What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?</strong></h3><p>There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever <strong>stop motion movie</strong> to be made? Which was “The Humpty Dumpty Circus” created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter’s dolls.</p>
<p>You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the “Nightmare Before Christmas” or “Rudolph the Reindeer.” And finally. You have “Chicken Run” which is considered the best performing <strong>stop motion movie</strong> of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Popular-Stop-Motion-Movies-You-Might-Wonder-1"><a href="#Part-2-Popular-Stop-Motion-Movies-You-Might-Wonder-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder"></a>Part 2 <strong>Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder</strong></h2><p>Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?</p>
<h3 id="01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-1"><a href="#01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-1" class="headerlink" title="01Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>01<strong>Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with <strong>Lego Movie stop motion</strong> animation. This <strong>stop motion movie</strong> animation style, also called ‘Brickfilms’, is the practice of using Lego to create <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong>. It’s been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.</p>
<p>It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-1"><a href="#023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-1" class="headerlink" title="023D Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>02<strong>3D Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Alright, so how about 3D <strong>stop motion movies</strong>? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it’s actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).</p>
<p>In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called “Tune with Tomorrow” but you might be more familiar with the title “Coraline.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films-1"><a href="#Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films</strong></h2><p>Now for our list of the best <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.</p>
<h3 id="01Coraline-2009-1"><a href="#01Coraline-2009-1" class="headerlink" title="01Coraline (2009)"></a>01<strong>Coraline (2009)</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this <strong>stop motion movie</strong> previously, but in case you haven’t already watched it, it’s a classic. The storytelling elements of “Coraline” really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn’t all that it was chalked up to be.</p>
<h3 id="02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993-1"><a href="#02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993-1" class="headerlink" title="02The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)"></a>02<strong>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</strong></h3><p>“The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993) is another <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington’s obsession with ruining Christmas.</p>
<h3 id="03Chicken-Run-1994-1"><a href="#03Chicken-Run-1994-1" class="headerlink" title="03Chicken Run (1994)"></a>03<strong>Chicken Run (1994)</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>stop motion movie</strong>, called “Chicken Run” (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.</p>
<h3 id="04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009-1"><a href="#04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009-1" class="headerlink" title="04Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)"></a>04<strong>Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)</strong></h3><p>The next film, released in the same year as “Coraline”, is called “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, ‘Mr. Fox’ and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.</p>
<h3 id="05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964-1"><a href="#05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964-1" class="headerlink" title="05Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)"></a>05<strong>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)</strong></h3><p>Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.</p>
<h3 id="06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016-1"><a href="#06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016-1" class="headerlink" title="06Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)"></a>06<strong>Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)</strong></h3><p>From the makers of Coraline is the <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>, called “Kubo and The Two Strings” (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It’s quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.</p>
<h3 id="07Alice-1988-1"><a href="#07Alice-1988-1" class="headerlink" title="07Alice (1988)"></a>07<strong>Alice (1988)</strong></h3><p>This next stop motion film is quite unique. It’s called “Alice” and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.</p>
<h3 id="088-Mary-and-Max-2009-1"><a href="#088-Mary-and-Max-2009-1" class="headerlink" title="088. Mary and Max (2009)"></a>08<strong>8. Mary and Max (2009)</strong></h3><p>Another <strong>stop motion movie</strong> that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called “Mary and Max.” This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.</p>
<h3 id="09The-Little-Prince-2016-1"><a href="#09The-Little-Prince-2016-1" class="headerlink" title="09The Little Prince (2016)"></a>09<strong>The Little Prince (2016)</strong></h3><p>Categorizing this film as ‘stop motion’ one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn’t detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of “The Little Prince.”</p>
<h3 id="10Frankenweenie-2012-1"><a href="#10Frankenweenie-2012-1" class="headerlink" title="10Frankenweenie (2012)"></a>10<strong>Frankenweenie (2012)</strong></h3><p>Another classic that you might recognize is “Frankenweenie” which was released in 2012. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.</p>

It won’t be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how <strong>stop motion movies</strong> are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Get-a-Camera-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Get-a-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Get a Camera."></a>01<strong>Step 1.

<p>You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the “Nightmare Before Christmas” or “Rudolph the Reindeer.” And finally.

Different from the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?</p>
<h3 id="01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-2"><a href="#01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-2" class="headerlink" title="01Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>01<strong>Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with <strong>Lego Movie stop motion</strong> animation. This <strong>stop motion movie</strong> animation style, also called ‘Brickfilms’, is the practice of using Lego to create <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong>. It’s been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.</p>
<p>It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-2"><a href="#023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-2" class="headerlink" title="023D Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>02<strong>3D Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Alright, so how about 3D <strong>stop motion movies</strong>? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it’s actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).</p>
<p>In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called “Tune with Tomorrow” but you might be more familiar with the title “Coraline.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films-2"><a href="#Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films</strong></h2><p>Now for our list of the best <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.</p>
<h3 id="01Coraline-2009-2"><a href="#01Coraline-2009-2" class="headerlink" title="01Coraline (2009)"></a>01<strong>Coraline (2009)</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this <strong>stop motion movie</strong> previously, but in case you haven’t already watched it, it’s a classic. The storytelling elements of “Coraline” really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn’t all that it was chalked up to be.</p>
<h3 id="02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993-2"><a href="#02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993-2" class="headerlink" title="02The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)"></a>02<strong>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</strong></h3><p>“The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993) is another <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington’s obsession with ruining Christmas.</p>
<h3 id="03Chicken-Run-1994-2"><a href="#03Chicken-Run-1994-2" class="headerlink" title="03Chicken Run (1994)"></a>03<strong>Chicken Run (1994)</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>stop motion movie</strong>, called “Chicken Run” (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.</p>
<h3 id="04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009-2"><a href="#04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009-2" class="headerlink" title="04Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)"></a>04<strong>Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)</strong></h3><p>The next film, released in the same year as “Coraline”, is called “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, ‘Mr. Fox’ and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.</p>
<h3 id="05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964-2"><a href="#05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964-2" class="headerlink" title="05Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)"></a>05<strong>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)</strong></h3><p>Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.</p>
<h3 id="06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016-2"><a href="#06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016-2" class="headerlink" title="06Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)"></a>06<strong>Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)</strong></h3><p>From the makers of Coraline is the <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>, called “Kubo and The Two Strings” (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It’s quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.</p>
<h3 id="07Alice-1988-2"><a href="#07Alice-1988-2" class="headerlink" title="07Alice (1988)"></a>07<strong>Alice (1988)</strong></h3><p>This next stop motion film is quite unique. It’s called “Alice” and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.</p>
<h3 id="088-Mary-and-Max-2009-2"><a href="#088-Mary-and-Max-2009-2" class="headerlink" title="088. Mary and Max (2009)"></a>08<strong>8. Mary and Max (2009)</strong></h3><p>Another <strong>stop motion movie</strong> that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called “Mary and Max.” This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.</p>
<h3 id="09The-Little-Prince-2016-2"><a href="#09The-Little-Prince-2016-2" class="headerlink" title="09The Little Prince (2016)"></a>09<strong>The Little Prince (2016)</strong></h3><p>Categorizing this film as ‘stop motion’ one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn’t detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of “The Little Prince.”</p>
<h3 id="10Frankenweenie-2012-2"><a href="#10Frankenweenie-2012-2" class="headerlink" title="10Frankenweenie (2012)"></a>10<strong>Frankenweenie (2012)</strong></h3><p>Another classic that you might recognize is “Frankenweenie” which was released in 2012. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movie-2"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movie-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie</strong></h2><p>For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised ‘tutorial’. It won’t be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how <strong>stop motion movies</strong> are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Get-a-Camera-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Get-a-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Get a Camera."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Get a Camera.</strong></h3><p>The first and most important part of setting up for a stop <strong>motion movie</strong> is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you’ll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.</p>
<p>In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.</p>

Prepare Materials for the Set.</strong></h3><p>Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you’ll need some pre-prepared in order to start.</p>
<p>This can be Lego action figures (if you’re working on a <strong>Lego stop motion movie</strong>) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you’re working on a 3D animation <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>.)</p>

Prepare the Set.</strong></h3><p>For stop motion, it’s important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.</p>
<p>And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it’s best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best <strong>stop motion movies</strong> in film history, you’ll notice that they’re all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.</p>

This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.</p>
<p>It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it’s the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing ‘motion’ by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.</p>

It won’t be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how <strong>stop motion movies</strong> are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Get-a-Camera-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Get-a-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Get a Camera."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Get a Camera.</strong></h3><p>The first and most important part of setting up for a stop <strong>motion movie</strong> is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you’ll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.</p>
<p>In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.</p>

Prepare Materials for the Set.</strong></h3><p>Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you’ll need some pre-prepared in order to start.</p>
<p>This can be Lego action figures (if you’re working on a <strong>Lego stop motion movie</strong>) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you’re working on a 3D animation <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>.)</p>

<p>And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it’s best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best <strong>stop motion movies</strong> in film history, you’ll notice that they’re all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.</p>

This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<h3 id="05Express-Animate"><a href="#05Express-Animate" class="headerlink" title="05Express Animate"></a>05Express Animate</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $60 (full license)</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software.

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions!

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking.

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily.

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire.

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>
