<p>Canva is a graphic design platform that allows users to create stunning designs for social media posts, presentations, assignments, recipe cards, birthday videos.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Canva’s animation feature, a whole new world of possibilities are open to the public. Also, with pre-designed templates from professional designers, content creation has never been easier than Canva.</p>
<p>Animations themselves have the option of being individually customized element by element. Canva animated graphics makes it easy to unleash your creative potential.</p>
<p>This article will explore how to animate graphics in Canva that can suit every occasion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Animate Your Graphic In Canva](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-1-Animate-Your-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 1 Animate Your Graphic In Canva</h2><p>People can create animations in Canva in one of two ways. You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>
<p>● A4 Documents</p>
<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>
<p>● YouTube Thumbnails</p>
<p>● Presentation</p>
<p>● Flyer&#x2F;Poster</p>
<p>● Instagram Logo</p>
<p>● Infographic</p>
<p>These options generate the ability to be presented in both portrait and landscape mode. The multitude of options makes it an ideal medium for you to create your animation. The animation options at Canva also come with the opportunity to animate an existing image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-1.png"
                      alt="Free Animated Presentation"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-3.png"
                      alt="Animating Images in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva"><a href="#2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?"></a>2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?</h3><p>Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva"><a href="#2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?"></a>2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?</h3><p>Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>

Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-1"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options.

<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script"><a href="#01Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img

                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img

                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images"><a href="#03Create-Images" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script-3"><a href="#01Write-a-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-5.jpg"
                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard-3"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard-3" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-6.jpg"
                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images-3"><a href="#03Create-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images-3"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio-3" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>
