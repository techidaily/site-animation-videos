<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies. Although, DC remains the king regards to animated movies. DC animated movies are better coordinated with live-action scenes. Each story features different aspects of Gotham city and its issues.</p>
<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.</p>

<p>Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies. Although, DC remains the king regards to animated movies. DC animated movies are better coordinated with live-action scenes. Each story features different aspects of Gotham city and its issues.</p>
<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.</p>

Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>

<h3 id="3-Bucket-tool-3"><a href="#3-Bucket-tool-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Bucket tool"></a>3. Bucket tool</h3><p>The bucket tool is another useful tool that you can find in the left tool pane of pencil 2d animation. The tool icon looks like a bucket and it is used to fill an entire area with a particular color. You can choose the color you’d like to fill from the color pallet available on the left side. Alternatively, you can also access the bucket tool by pressing the “K” key on your keyboard.</p>

<h3 id="4-Custom-colors-3"><a href="#4-Custom-colors-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Custom colors"></a>4. Custom colors</h3><p>A cool feature that you can find on pencil 2d animation software is the custom color one. You can merge and mix colors according to your choice and create your own color. To do so, you need to click on the small color box that you’ll find at the top right of your screen. By doing so, a huge color wheel will appear on your screen. Now you can either enter values of the R, G, and B if you wish to merge different colors and make a new one or select a particular color from the huge color wheel that appears in front of you. These colors vary in gradient, shade, and a lot of different factors.</p>

The Undo button</h3><p>The Undo button is a highly useful functionality for the lazy ones who do not wish to erase the mistake they made. By undoing, the previous step gets reverted and you can start over again. The traditional undo shortcut, Ctrl+Z does work in the pencil 2d animation. Alternatively, you can also use the undo feature via the user interface. You can do so by heading over to the edit option in the topmost bar. The first option in the drop-down menu would be undo.</p>

Follow the steps listed below in order to learn how to animate through pencil 2d to make your first animation.</p>
<h3 id="1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame-3"><a href="#1-Ensure-that-you’ve-turned-on-your-bitmap-on-the-first-frame-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure that you’ve turned on your bitmap on the first frame"></a>1. Ensure that you’ve turned on your bitmap on the first frame</h3><p>Animation works through quick switching of frame which makes it appear as though the object is in motion. By turning on the bitmap, pencil 2d animation ensures that you’ve no blank frames at the start of your animation.</p>

<h3 id="2-Draw-your-animated-character-3"><a href="#2-Draw-your-animated-character-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Draw your animated character"></a>2. Draw your animated character</h3><p>Since you’re trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.</p>

<h3 id="3-The-three-circular-buttons-3"><a href="#3-The-three-circular-buttons-3" class="headerlink" title="3.The three circular buttons"></a>3.The three circular buttons</h3><p>Once you’re satisfied with the character you draw, you need to spot the 3 circular buttons which are arranged in the “+”,”-“,”+” order. By pressing the first “+” button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the “-“ button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next “+” button, it will duplicate the current slide.</p>

For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you’ve your desired animated video.</p>
