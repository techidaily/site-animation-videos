<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>

                ></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png"
                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 07"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 07"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 12"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 13"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Finally, and there you have it. Congratulation! You now have your perfect, awesome, beautiful, and YOUR cartoon.</p>

<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png"
                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"
                      alt="Canva page animations"
                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video"><a href="#2-3-Video" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.</p>
<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>

This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Canva-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Canva?"></a>Part 1 What is Canva?</h2><p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-1"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-1"><a href="#2-1-Image-1" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"

<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text-1"><a href="#2-2-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-5.png"
                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video-1"><a href="#2-3-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Make-Elements-Move-In-Canva-1"><a href="#Part-3-Make-Elements-Move-In-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva"></a>Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva</h2><h3 id="How-To-Arrange-The-Order-Of-An-Animation-1"><a href="#How-To-Arrange-The-Order-Of-An-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?"></a>How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?</h3><p>The brilliant thing about Canva is that you can decide the order you want to create your animation. The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.</p>
<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva-1"><a href="#How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva"></a>How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva</h3><p>Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-About-Making-Animated-Elements-On-Video-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-About-Making-Animated-Elements-On-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video"></a>Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video</h2><p>If you’ve decided Canva is not the tool for you, you can choose any video editing software to make your animation.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png"
                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-3"><a href="#2-1-Image-3" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"
                      alt="Canva page animations"
                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text-3"><a href="#2-2-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-5.png"
                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video-3"><a href="#2-3-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-6.png"
                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.</p>
<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>

This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>

<p>It will be beneficial while knowing <strong>how to make 2D animation for games</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements"><a href="#01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements" class="headerlink" title="01Focus on the story and start with simple movements"></a>01Focus on the story and start with simple movements</h3><p>You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don’t miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.</p>
<h3 id="02Use-keyframes-properly"><a href="#02Use-keyframes-properly" class="headerlink" title="02Use keyframes properly"></a>02Use keyframes properly</h3><p>You need to carefully use keyframes’ start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.</p>
<h3 id="03Enliven-your-characters"><a href="#03Enliven-your-characters" class="headerlink" title="03Enliven your characters"></a>03Enliven your characters</h3><p>You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.</p>
<p>Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical <strong>2D</strong> <strong>game animation</strong> strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>
<p>This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.</p>

<p>It will be beneficial while knowing <strong>how to make 2D animation for games</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements-1"><a href="#01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements-1" class="headerlink" title="01Focus on the story and start with simple movements"></a>01Focus on the story and start with simple movements</h3><p>You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don’t miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.</p>
<h3 id="02Use-keyframes-properly-1"><a href="#02Use-keyframes-properly-1" class="headerlink" title="02Use keyframes properly"></a>02Use keyframes properly</h3><p>You need to carefully use keyframes’ start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements.

Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.</p>
<p>Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical <strong>2D</strong> <strong>game animation</strong> strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-1"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-1"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-1" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-2"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>

<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>

Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>

This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>

                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>

<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-3"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-3" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>
<p>This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.</p>

<p>In case your selected images do not have a matching aspect ratio with the program’s preset values, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option for removing the additional black bars from the selected images. For the requirement of adding camera pan and zoom movements to your images, select the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option in the ‘Preferences’ settings.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself.

To do this, navigate to the ‘Transitions’ tab in the top toolbar of Filmora’s project window and select a desired one from over 100 choices of customizable transitions.</p>
<p>You can now drop these transitions in the timeline at the exact intersection point of two image files. Avoid using the same transition for every hard cut to escape monotony. You can instead choose different transitions for each slide while observing its appearance in the clip.</p>
<p>After you are done with applying transitions to each slide, double click on a particular transition to open its ‘Transition Setting Window’ either for presetting the transition play duration or to choose a desired transition mode. You can also prefer a direct customization of the transition duration in the project timeline through a right or left dragging of any of its ends.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Add Your Images and Videos</strong></p>
<p>Creating a slideshow presentation may require a set of multiple image and video files to the program’s graphic creator timeline. It is recommended to add your selections of the aforesaid files to a single folder before launching the software in your system.</p>
<p>Once you have finished making your selections, launch the program to reach its welcome interface, were you need to navigate and click on the ‘Media’ tab in the top toolbar. From the task options that appear, click on ‘Import a Media’. Next, you will be asked to browse through your device locations and choose the folder that contains your previously selected files to be used in the presentation you are about to create.</p>

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Animated Slideshow Creator- Media Import Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Timeline Positioning of Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Before working on the task of positioning the imported media files on the app’s timeline, navigate to the ‘File’ menu and choose the ‘Preferences’ option. As soon as the respective window pops up, reach to the ‘Editing’ tab at the top and select ‘Photo Placement’ from the drop down menu that follows.</p>
<p>In case your selected images do not have a matching aspect ratio with the program’s preset values, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option for removing the additional black bars from the selected images. For the requirement of adding camera pan and zoom movements to your images, select the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option in the ‘Preferences’ settings.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself. As an alternative you can adhere to the same task in the program’s timeline by dragging any one end of the media files in an outward or inward direction. The ‘Crop to Fit’ option may not give an affordable size in some cases where the images are set in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio. Choose the ‘Fit’ option to set this issue straight.</p>
<p><img

        Adjustment"
                ></p>
<p>When you have finished making all the aforesaid adjustments, navigate to the Media panel again for adding the selected image files to the software’s timeline. Proceed with selecting a file and dragging and dropping the same at the desired position within the timeline. Continue repeating the process till all the images have been placed at their respective locations, and in the exact order of appearance in the slideshow. This should be followed by adjusting the image play durations using any one of the previously described methods.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Escape Hard Cuts With Image Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Hard cuts among different slides of a presentation break the flow of the slideshow. To escape this cringe, consider using a smooth transition effect within the slides of your project. To do this, navigate to the ‘Transitions’ tab in the top toolbar of Filmora’s project window and select a desired one from over 100 choices of customizable transitions.</p>
<p>You can now drop these transitions in the timeline at the exact intersection point of two image files. Avoid using the same transition for every hard cut to escape monotony. You can instead choose different transitions for each slide while observing its appearance in the clip.</p>
<p>After you are done with applying transitions to each slide, double click on a particular transition to open its ‘Transition Setting Window’ either for presetting the transition play duration or to choose a desired transition mode. You can also prefer a direct customization of the transition duration in the project timeline through a right or left dragging of any of its ends.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Uplift Your Slideshow Colors With Overlays and Filters</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Effects’ tab to choose from a diversity of visual effects that can be added to the slideshow images to supplement them with an increased vibrancy through color desaturation. These effects in the program’s library are categorized into classes of Overlays and Filters, with further subcategories of Sepia Tone, Light Leaks and Lomography and many more.</p>
<p>To apply these effects, just select and add them into a timeline track above the clip you wish to add the overlay or filter to. When you have applied the effects, observe the overall clip appearance in the ‘Preview Panel’. Double click on a particular effect to fine-tune the latter’s settings.</p>

        Overlays"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Supplement Your Slides With Motion Graphic Elements</strong></p>
<p>While motion graphics will undoubtedly enhance your animated slideshows, adding them to your presentation is purely optional, since most professional projects do not need a motion graphic element to escalate their presentation outlook. If, however, you choose to work on making these a part of your animated slideshow, Filmora lets you do that in its ‘Elements’ tab.</p>
<p>There is a plethora of motion graphic templates that you can select and add to the project timeline for a quick and vibrant upgrade of your presentation slides, but, at the same time, it becomes important to take care of the visual outlook and the underlying reason of creating the slideshow before you decide on adding these elements to your project.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Create Voiceovers and Record Soundtracks for Your Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>Narration is a smart way to captivate the target audience within your slideshow, whether though a self-delivery or a recorded voiceover. If you decide on the second option, you can conveniently use the Filmora Slideshow Creator program to add voiceovers and soundtracks to your presentation.</p>
<p>To adhere to the purpose, navigate to the top toolbar and click on the ‘Media’ tab. From the options that appear, tap on the ‘Record’ menu that drops down, followed by selecting the ‘Record Voiceover’ option. As soon as the ‘Record Audio’ prompt pops up, select your desired microphone to be used in the recording process and click on the ‘Record’ button.</p>
