<p>“<strong>Text Animation</strong>“ refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!</p>

<p>Adobe Animate is Adobe’s very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It’s also the one that we’d recommend if you’re looking into advanced <strong>adobe animate text animation</strong>!</p>

That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>

After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.</p>

<p>Adobe Animate is Adobe’s very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations.

That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>

<p>“<strong>Text Animation</strong>“ refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!</p>

<p>Adobe Animate is Adobe’s very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It’s also the one that we’d recommend if you’re looking into advanced <strong>adobe animate text animation</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects"></a>Part 3 <strong>5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects</strong></h2><p>Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>
<h3 id="01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets-3"><a href="#01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets-3" class="headerlink" title="01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets"></a>01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets</h3><p>The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png"
                      alt="Text Effects &amp; Presets"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02METHOD-2-After-Effects-Text-Animators-3"><a href="#02METHOD-2-After-Effects-Text-Animators-3" class="headerlink" title="02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators"></a>02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators</h3><p>If the presets aren’t working out for you, you can also try out After Effect’s “animators” and “selectors”. To clarify, you add ‘animators’ to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a ‘selector’ in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.</p>

This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a “Text” preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!</p>

<h3 id="04METHOD-4-Path-Animation-3"><a href="#04METHOD-4-Path-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04METHOD 4: Path Animation"></a>04METHOD 4: Path Animation</h3><p>The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we’ve introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.</p>

It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4–which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Be specific to your brand. Be sure that you are not choosing a logo that may deviate customers from your brand perspective.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Always choose colors in contrast because a single color logo does not seem to be appealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure to choose a template that is easy to understand. If the template seems to be difficult to understand, a user will not be able to get it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>

Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>

Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-4.jpg"
                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-9.jpg"
                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-11.jpg"
                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>

                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="save image photoshop"

<p>The first step to <strong>making a collage in photoshop</strong> is to select all the photos you would like your collage to have. Now, it will be best for you to choose your photos wisely. We understand that each photograph is equally sweet and cherishable. But, when you select the images for your collage in a thoughtful manner, the collage turns out much better than expected.</p>
<p>You can use different <strong>collage ideas for photoshop</strong>, such as following a particular storyline, where you collage the photos so that it recreates the memory or the moments in sequence. Another way to select your photos is by sticking to a particular theme, and it can be vintage or on one specific color or the like. It will help your collage turn out in the best and the most thoughtful way.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Opening the photos you have selected, in collage maker photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have selected which images you would want your collage to have, the next step will require you to open those images in the <strong>collage maker Photoshop</strong>. For this, you will have to select the option “File”. There, you will find the option “Open”. Then you will open the images you have chosen in Photoshop.</p>
<p>Also, you can simply press the “ctrl” and the “O” keys on your keyboard and it will automatically help you open the images you have selected for the <strong>photo collage on photoshop</strong>.</p>

                      alt="new image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way to open the pages you have selected for your collage is through the “Drag and Drop” function. It is more effortless to choose the images and open them in Photoshop. After you have opened the photos in Photoshop, it will open in a different tab and look like in the following picture.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-3.jpg"
                      alt="open photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Make a new file for your collage on photoshop</strong></p>
<p>The third step requires you to make a new file for your <strong>photo collage in photoshop</strong>. For this, you need to select or click on the “File” option on Photoshop. Then, click on the “New” option. It will help you make a new file for your collage. You can also select the “ctrl” and “N” together.</p>
<p>As you click on the “New” option, you will be given options to choose from. Choose the one that matches your preference.</p>
<p>When you are working on photoshop to make a collage, the images will need a collage background because it is on this background that the photos will assemble. If you have made a collage before on photoshop, you can use the old <strong>collage photoshop template</strong>. Otherwise, you need to create a new document for the collage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-4.jpg"
                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-8.jpg"
                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-9.jpg"
                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-10.jpg"
                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-11.jpg"
                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-12.jpg"
                      alt="save a jpeg photoshop"
                ></p>
