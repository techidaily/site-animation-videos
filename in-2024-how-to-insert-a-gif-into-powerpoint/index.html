<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now. People who use this application make a common mistake of using too many slides with huge amounts of text and that is a major turnoff for the audience. Huge text is seen as a disaster. You should be able to convey an interesting story to your attentive audience without explaining every single detail on your slides for your presentation. Using a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GIF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to explain complicate things or just set it as a background can be much interesting.</p>

<h4 id="Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility"><a href="#Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility"></a>Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility</h4><p> Select the Insert tab located at the top of the Powerpoint application.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-gif-to-ppt-1.jpg"
                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>
<p> You also have the option to move the GIF image on the page by clicking and dragging the image to the location that you want to place the picture.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Copy-and-Paste"><a href="#Method-2-Copy-and-Paste" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Copy and Paste"></a>Method 2: Copy and Paste</h4><p> A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first. Then, paste your image on the Powerpoint slide by pressing Control + V.</p>
<p> You can also highlight the file name, and then use the drag and drop feature to put your image directly into the Powerpoint slide of your choice.</p>
<h4 id="Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web"><a href="#Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web"></a>Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web</h4><p> The final method is to embed GIF images on the Internet into a Powerpoint slide. You can achieve this function by using the Insert Ribbon’s Pictures icon.</p>
<p> Select Pictures, then write in the image URL directly in the File input box. Then, select Insert. The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.</p>
<p> Here we recommend the method 1 and 2, the method 3 will take a little time while Powerpoint downloading the GIF picture.</p>
<h2 id="Customize-the-GIFs-in-Powerpoint"><a href="#Customize-the-GIFs-in-Powerpoint" class="headerlink" title="Customize the GIFs in Powerpoint"></a>Customize the GIFs in Powerpoint</h2><p> There are some important ways to customize your GIF images in the Powerpoint application.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-gif-to-ppt-2.jpg"
                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> If you desire on changing the physical size of your GIF file or changing the appearance of the image, you can right click on your desired image and select Format Pictures. It will open up a brand new Format Picture window that will have a good variety of image editing menus at your fingertips at the left side of the computer window.</p>
<p> There is a feature where you can change the brightness and contrast on your images by selecting the Picture Corrections icon. Experiment and have fun.</p>

<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now. People who use this application make a common mistake of using too many slides with huge amounts of text and that is a major turnoff for the audience. Huge text is seen as a disaster. You should be able to convey an interesting story to your attentive audience without explaining every single detail on your slides for your presentation.

<p>When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to <strong>convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop</strong>, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. Its file format is a compressed image, and it is most suitable for animation. We all know that an animated GIF comprises a series of many still images.

<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience.

With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-The-Art-of-Effective-Rigging-in-Blender-TUTORIAL-3"><a href="#Part-2-The-Art-of-Effective-Rigging-in-Blender-TUTORIAL-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender [TUTORIAL]"></a>Part 2 <strong>The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender [TUTORIAL]</strong></h2><p>For this next section, we’re going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong>, and so on.</p>
<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3"><a href="#Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course"></a>Part 3 <strong>Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course</strong></h2><p>For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. Whether it be about <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender facial rigging</strong>, <strong>free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs</strong>, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.</p>
<h3 id="01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3"><a href="#01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="01Where to Learn the Course?"></a>01<strong>Where to Learn the Course?</strong></h3><p>The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters’ <strong>blender rigging</strong> course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.</p>

We suggest the “Blender Fundamentals” course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is “Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of <strong>Blender rigging</strong> (including <strong>Blender rigging</strong> and <strong>Blender rigging</strong> videos.)</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> subjects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master’s introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender’s own “Blender Fundamental” series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you’ll need to know.)</p>

She is hit by a train while riding a bicycle on her way home. Strangely, she didn’t die, instead, she gets transported back in time to minutes before the train hit her. She later learns she can do time leaps. With her newfound ability, she starts leaping through time to get out of awkward situations and events. She soon discovers her time leaps have adverse effects on others and dedicates her time leaps to helping others.</p>
<p>This 2006 anime movie showed us how kind the human heart can be as she decides to use her gift to help others.</p>
<h3 id="8-The-Garden-of-Words-3"><a href="#8-The-Garden-of-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="8. The Garden of Words"></a>8. The Garden of Words</h3><p>The film focuses on the encounters of a 15-year-old boy and a 27-year-old woman. The young boy always met this woman at a particular garden on rainy mornings and soon they become chatty. While she never told him anything about herself including her name, the young boy tells the woman everything about himself. When he finally learns who she is, they both discover they have been helping each other learn how to walk life’s journey. The movie depicts just how maturity is a thing of the mind. It shows just how adults also feel the same way teenagers feel and how teenagers receive the same pressure adults suffer.</p>
<h3 id="9-Doukyusei-3"><a href="#9-Doukyusei-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Doukyusei"></a>9. Doukyusei</h3><p>Doukyusei tells us about a carefree boy who is part of a band. Being always focused on what’s happening now, he and his entire class are forced to partake in an upcoming chorus festival. Coincidentally he meets one of his classmates who is well known for his brilliance. He sees him practicing alone and failing woefully to get their class song right. Happy to see the brilliant student in need of help, he decides to help his new friend achieve his aim and prepare for the upcoming event. This is not your conventional anime romance movie because it tells a story of two boys and their ‘love’ for each other.</p>
<h3 id="10-5-Centimeters-Per-Second-3"><a href="#10-5-Centimeters-Per-Second-3" class="headerlink" title="10. 5 Centimeters Per Second"></a>10. 5 Centimeters Per Second</h3><p>This film tells us the story of a young boy who gets the chance to befriend a new girl who was just transferred to his school. We are taken through their genuine friendship which came as a result of their taste and interests being the same. They soon develop strong feelings for each other and their bond is shown when they both speak to each other using their names only. They later go separate ways in a bid to further their studies but while apart they could still communicate deeply. They go on to meet different partners and even have children but their connection remained intact.</p>
<p>This short series shows us just how amazing the human heart can be when deeply attached to another.</p>
