<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>

                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg"
                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>

                ></p>

                ></p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg"
                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg"
                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg"
                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="erase and shade"

<h3 id="01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="01Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal’ by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you’re confused, it’s a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.</p>
<p>Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.</p>
<h3 id="02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title"><a href="#02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title" class="headerlink" title="02Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title"></a>02<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title</strong></a></h3><p>The next <strong>text motion</strong> template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title’ also created by Mogrt. This one is <strong>text motion graphics</strong> that you can use for <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It’s a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!</p>
<p>As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as <strong>text motion</strong> for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt" >after effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is available for that as well!</p>
<h3 id="03Simple-Motion-Text-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#03Simple-Motion-Text-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="03Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro"></a>03<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?_ga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text’ graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we’ve provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that’s just starting out and doesn’t want anything too complicated.</p>
<h3 id="0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt"><a href="#0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="0430 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt"></a>04<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?_ga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets’ by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It’s also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it’s not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch’ effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn’t make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!</p>
<p>The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT"><a href="#05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT" class="headerlink" title="05Comic Bubbles MOGRT"></a>05<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?_ga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Comic Bubbles MOGRT</strong></a></h3><p>Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles’, kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that’s the kind of look that you’re looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic’ text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy’ text in between animated projects.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation"></a>Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation</h2><p>Animators follow a list of strict principles to create the most inspiring projects. And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                      alt="squash and stretch animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation"><a href="#02Anticipation" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

                      alt="anticipation animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="ease in animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing"><a href="#04Timing" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="timing animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun"><a href="#01It-is-fun" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression"><a href="#02Lasting-impression" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget"><a href="#01Budget" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience"><a href="#03Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market"><a href="#04Market" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun-1"><a href="#01It-is-fun-1" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-1"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-1" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-1"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-1" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand.

However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-1"><a href="#01Budget-1" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-1"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-1" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-1"><a href="#03Target-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-1"><a href="#04Market-1" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-1"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-1" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation"></a>Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation</h2><p>Animators follow a list of strict principles to create the most inspiring projects. And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch-2"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch-2" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation-2"><a href="#02Anticipation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out-2"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out-2" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>

And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch-3"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch-3" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation-3"><a href="#02Anticipation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out-3"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out-3" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing-3"><a href="#04Timing-3" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing-3"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing-3" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun-3"><a href="#01It-is-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-3"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-3" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-3"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-3" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-3"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-3"><a href="#01Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-3"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-3" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-3"><a href="#03Target-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-3"><a href="#04Market-3" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Animated Slideshow Creator- Media Import Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Timeline Positioning of Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Before working on the task of positioning the imported media files on the app’s timeline, navigate to the ‘File’ menu and choose the ‘Preferences’ option. As soon as the respective window pops up, reach to the ‘Editing’ tab at the top and select ‘Photo Placement’ from the drop down menu that follows.</p>
<p>In case your selected images do not have a matching aspect ratio with the program’s preset values, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option for removing the additional black bars from the selected images. For the requirement of adding camera pan and zoom movements to your images, select the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option in the ‘Preferences’ settings.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself. As an alternative you can adhere to the same task in the program’s timeline by dragging any one end of the media files in an outward or inward direction. The ‘Crop to Fit’ option may not give an affordable size in some cases where the images are set in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio. Choose the ‘Fit’ option to set this issue straight.</p>

Continue repeating the process till all the images have been placed at their respective locations, and in the exact order of appearance in the slideshow. This should be followed by adjusting the image play durations using any one of the previously described methods.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Escape Hard Cuts With Image Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Hard cuts among different slides of a presentation break the flow of the slideshow. To escape this cringe, consider using a smooth transition effect within the slides of your project. To do this, navigate to the ‘Transitions’ tab in the top toolbar of Filmora’s project window and select a desired one from over 100 choices of customizable transitions.</p>
<p>You can now drop these transitions in the timeline at the exact intersection point of two image files. Avoid using the same transition for every hard cut to escape monotony. You can instead choose different transitions for each slide while observing its appearance in the clip.</p>
<p>After you are done with applying transitions to each slide, double click on a particular transition to open its ‘Transition Setting Window’ either for presetting the transition play duration or to choose a desired transition mode. You can also prefer a direct customization of the transition duration in the project timeline through a right or left dragging of any of its ends.</p>

<p>To apply these effects, just select and add them into a timeline track above the clip you wish to add the overlay or filter to. When you have applied the effects, observe the overall clip appearance in the ‘Preview Panel’. Double click on a particular effect to fine-tune the latter’s settings.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Supplement Your Slides With Motion Graphic Elements</strong></p>
<p>While motion graphics will undoubtedly enhance your animated slideshows, adding them to your presentation is purely optional, since most professional projects do not need a motion graphic element to escalate their presentation outlook. If, however, you choose to work on making these a part of your animated slideshow, Filmora lets you do that in its ‘Elements’ tab.</p>
<p>There is a plethora of motion graphic templates that you can select and add to the project timeline for a quick and vibrant upgrade of your presentation slides, but, at the same time, it becomes important to take care of the visual outlook and the underlying reason of creating the slideshow before you decide on adding these elements to your project.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Create Voiceovers and Record Soundtracks for Your Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>Narration is a smart way to captivate the target audience within your slideshow, whether though a self-delivery or a recorded voiceover. If you decide on the second option, you can conveniently use the Filmora Slideshow Creator program to add voiceovers and soundtracks to your presentation.</p>
