In ‘Finding Dory, ‘ young Dory’s amnesiac was finally brought back thirteen years later. Dory is perseverant, has a trim physique, and yet she can do whatever she has set her mind to do.</p>

On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>
