<p>There has been an advancement in the cartoon since the last publication made by “Paste” (a 5,800-word short story by Henry James). However, traditional cable networks have created exciting and new worlds and characters. Various streaming platforms like YouTube have allowed different creators to <strong>draw cartoon videos</strong> and publish them as they want. It has long been said that cartoons are specifically made for kids to enjoy on Saturday morning, but this is no longer the case as adults now enjoy watching cartoons in their free time.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

<p>However, here are the ten best cartoon shows that have existed since the Simpsons:</p>
<h3 id="01Futurama"><a href="#01Futurama" class="headerlink" title="01Futurama"></a>01Futurama</h3><p>This <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that’s pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

Animation video is a craft in which images go through the process of conspiring, layout addition, and photographic chronology to create an illusion of action. In this article, let’s learn the importance of video animations and when and why to use this technique.</p>

<h2 id="What-are-Video-Animation-and-its-importance"><a href="#What-are-Video-Animation-and-its-importance" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Animation and its importance?"></a>What are Video Animation and its importance?</h2><p>Video as a marketing tool has become more popular but also more important. In this article, you can read more about why media marketing is getting more essential in comparison to text marketing. Therefore, an explainer video with Animation is an amazing way to show your target audience who you are, where you stand for, what you do and how you can solve the customer’s problem.</p>
<p>Video animation is an engaging technique that can help you comprehensively tell your story. Animated meaning can be better comprehended as a simulation of motion created by showing a series of pictures. Animated videos for a business catch the viewers and make for an enjoyable story-telling experience.</p>
<p>Often, animation videos are used to explain a concept or process. It’s straightforward to make these videos appealing and likable as you can primarily create them however you want. It can take longer to get the point across when people explain how to do something. Animations not only trigger emotions but spark conversations as well.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-most-common-types-of-Animation"><a href="#What-are-most-common-types-of-Animation" class="headerlink" title="What are most common types of Animation?"></a>What are most common types of Animation?</h2><p>The purpose of this article is to take you through the complexity of the different types of animation styles and methods. It also covers the track you should take (and what that path entails) to become an animator for each of the five types.</p>
<p>This guide is not about learning how to animate. But instead, it breaks down the five types of Animation available to you and what you’ll need to start animating: best software, schools, and courses.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Graphics (Key framing)</strong>: Motion graphics focus on making dynamic and exciting presentations of moving text logos and fundamental illustrations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion graphics can be 2D and 3D, and you’ll find them everywhere in news, sporting videos, the news, and other TV productions.</li>
<li>Correct character animation is generally outside the scope of motion graphics, but many core animation principles also apply to motion graphics.</li>
<li>Creating Motion Graphics depends on the plan used since video editing software often have different user interface or settings, but the idea is the same. Motion Graphics usually involves animating texts, pictures, or video clips using keyframing that is tweened to make a smooth motion between frames.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Traditional Animation</strong>: This is the classic type of Animation you’re probably most well known with. In the past, animators drew characters frame by frame, and then those pictures were moved onto transparent sheets for painting. That’s where the term animation comes from.</p>
<p>They started scanning drawings into the computer for digital coloring. The important thing is that hand-drawn animators still create their animation frame by frame using the same method and concept as in those old days of paper and cels.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora"></a>How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora</h2><p>Keyframes specify the start or end of a transition in a shot. A series of keyframes can give the semblance of the movement of an object. Keyframes include parameters such as Position, Scale, Opacity, and Rotation. These values can be changed and customized to make animations using keyframing.</p>

<p>Step2 Import your selected images. In this case I imported no background images to have a clear view on how key framing works.</p>

                      alt="import animation file filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag or add the image on the Timeline Panel.</p>
<p>In this case I use a dove and a cloud to demo the Motion graphics animation</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="motion graphics animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double click the image then the Animation tab will display. Here, there are available presets, either the latest or the Legacy Animation, as indicated on the display that you can use.</p>
<p>There is also a tab if you want to customize your animations which requires premium account.</p>

<p>Step5 Select any animation you want by double-clicking the presets. In this case, I selected a slight right preset, and you will notice that the start arrow and end arrow indicator are displayed.</p>
<p>In the Timeline panel, you have an option to customize the start and end of the Preset. Just drag the arrow keys on either side to reach the keyframe you wish to change. Just simple.</p>

<h2 id="Takeaway"><a href="#Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Takeaway"></a>Takeaway</h2><p>Keyframing can bring steady images to life by introducing animations. With the super-easy keyframing tool in Filmora, you can now make invigorating videos. From easy to complex key framing. The customization property lets you unbind your creativity and take your editing to a professional level. Make your logo pop by adding keyframe animations. Better yet, you can also animate text.</p>
<p>No matter what industry you’re in, Animation can be relevant. Small start-ups to giant corporations use animation videos, too. Animation videos help to explain tricky processes or concepts, sell a product, or even to gain recognition for a product. Everyone resonates with Animation in some way or another. Almost everyone has watched cartoons or animations in their life, so these tend to grab attention more effectively.</p>
<p>We all love animation. From the animated cartoons we watched as kids to the latest and hottest animated music video, there’s something about seeing visuals come alive that captivates and inspires us. But video animation isn’t just for children, and it isn’t just for the entertainment value only.</p>

<p>If what you’re searching for is a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs"><a href="#Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs"></a>Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs</h2><p>First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools and <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-4"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-4" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>The first <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.</p>
<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Launch Filmora Video Editor"></a>01Step 1: Launch <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>First things first, launch the <strong>3D GIF maker</strong> that you intend to use. In our case, that is Filmora (a screenshot has been provided below for your edification and reference. We’ll be using Filmora as our example.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media &gt; Import Media File. However, you can also drag and drop your file(s) on the designated area of the UI..</p>

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>
<p>And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.</p>

<p>This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.</p>

<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop-1"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop-1" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>

<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop-3"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>

With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>
