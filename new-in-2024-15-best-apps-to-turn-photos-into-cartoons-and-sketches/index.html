These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations"><a href="#Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations"></a>Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations</h2><p>3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.</p>
<h3 id="01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients"><a href="#01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients" class="headerlink" title="01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients"></a>01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients</h3><p>Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.</p>
<h3 id="03Educating-New-Professionals"><a href="#03Educating-New-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="03Educating New Professionals"></a>03Educating New Professionals</h3><p>For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.</p>
<h3 id="04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool"><a href="#04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="04Used As A Marketing Tool"></a>04Used As A Marketing Tool</h3><p>Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.</p>
<h3 id="05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional"><a href="#05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional" class="headerlink" title="05Marketing To Medical Professional"></a>05Marketing To Medical Professional</h3><p>While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.</p>

Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-1"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-1" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures.

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-3D-Medical-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-3D-Medical-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?</h2><p>A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry. These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations-3"><a href="#Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations"></a>Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations</h2><p>3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.</p>
<h3 id="01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients-3"><a href="#01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients-3" class="headerlink" title="01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients"></a>01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients</h3><p>Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-3"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-3" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.</p>
<h3 id="03Educating-New-Professionals-3"><a href="#03Educating-New-Professionals-3" class="headerlink" title="03Educating New Professionals"></a>03Educating New Professionals</h3><p>For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.</p>
<h3 id="04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool-3"><a href="#04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="04Used As A Marketing Tool"></a>04Used As A Marketing Tool</h3><p>Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.</p>
<h3 id="05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional-3"><a href="#05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional-3" class="headerlink" title="05Marketing To Medical Professional"></a>05Marketing To Medical Professional</h3><p>While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.</p>

<p>Today there is a lot pre-made skeletons you can use and reuse as many times as you want, making only a few minor adjustments to the base design. If your creativity is sparking like firecrackers, then a rig can make it look more defined and&#x2F;or realistic.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Let’s talk more about <strong>Rigging Animation</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-16"><a href="#In-this-article-16" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Rigging Animation](#Part 1)</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>

<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>

<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
