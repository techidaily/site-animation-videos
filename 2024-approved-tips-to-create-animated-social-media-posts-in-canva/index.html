For example, the eyes’ shape and size will help determine if the person is feeling sad, excited, happy, excited, or sad. In addition, the amount of lift under a person’s eyebrows can help determine whether a person is mad or not.</p>
<p>These facial expressions are crucial to how a person communicates. It has got to the point that we can read someone’s face without truly understanding which parts of the face convey that emotion. However, these days we get exposed to everyday adaptations of facial expressions, especially with the invention of Instagram, Snapchat, and cartoon face filters.</p>
<p>Consequently, cartoons are a combination of different shapes that are being put together and are not difficult if the focus is on each shape individually and the process breaks down step by step.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                      alt="how to draw a cartoon face 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Drawing Cartoon Hair</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

                ></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

It is one of those fields that require several technical skills. These are brilliant programming skills, understanding the basics of computer science, and practical technology know-how, collectively standing as the basic fundamental of Animation. Both 2D and 3D Animation changed the gaming experience forever and created an array of opportunities. But they differ in working and application.</p>
<h3 id="01Working-on-2D-Animation-3"><a href="#01Working-on-2D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01Working on 2D Animation"></a>01Working on 2D Animation</h3><p>Flipbook can be a good example of the mechanism behind 2D Animation. After drawing a character or an object on the first page of a notebook, continue drawing for the next page and so on. Each removing should be a bit ahead or behind. When flipped swiftly, the series of drawings makes the character or object move.</p>
<p>The working of 2D Animation is not so different. But the detailing of the subject or the object cannot be minimal as a flipbook. 2D Animation demands more characters and more details while at the same time requiring smooth, visually appealing, and accurate detailing, which is a lot of pressure for the makers. Thanks to 2D making software, a week’s work can be taken care of in minutes or two.</p>
<h3 id="02Working-on-3D-Animation-3"><a href="#02Working-on-3D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Working on 3D Animation"></a>02Working on 3D Animation</h3><p>The working mechanism of 3D Animation is more complicated than 2D. It is a layered process that requires several skills. It also involves “rigged” and animated 3D models. In 3D, the initial sketch of the entire subject and object is the first step towards the animation procedure. The second step is to make a 3D model of the intended animated object. It was third, texturing of the 3D animated object. Rigging is the final step; it gives the 3D model the power and ability to move. Once rigging is done, the character is already for posing. Drop it to the scene and start your Animation.</p>

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

How To Set A GIF Loop Count?</h4><p>Nearly all GIF editors allow you to specify how many loops a GIF is going to make before it comes to a stop. All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>
