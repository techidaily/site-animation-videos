This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>
<h3 id="01Aurora-3D-Text-Logo-Maker"><a href="#01Aurora-3D-Text-Logo-Maker" class="headerlink" title="01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker"></a>01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> FREE!</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<h3 id="05Express-Animate"><a href="#05Express-Animate" class="headerlink" title="05Express Animate"></a>05Express Animate</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $60 (full license)</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="06Motion"><a href="#06Motion" class="headerlink" title="06Motion"></a>06Motion</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $47</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="07Xara-3D-Maker"><a href="#07Xara-3D-Maker" class="headerlink" title="07Xara 3D Maker"></a>07Xara 3D Maker</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $39.99</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<h3 id="08Easy-Banner"><a href="#08Easy-Banner" class="headerlink" title="08Easy Banner"></a>08Easy Banner</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> FREE</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<h3 id="09Falco-GIF-Animator"><a href="#09Falco-GIF-Animator" class="headerlink" title="09Falco GIF Animator"></a>09Falco GIF Animator</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> FREE</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3&#x2F;5</p>
<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you’ll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.</p>

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.</p>

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE!

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation.

<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for?

<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE!

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.</p>

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

<p>You can freeze parts of an image.</p>
<p>Variety of filters can be applied.</p>
<p>Although MotionLeap is free to use there’s a Pro and subscription version with a greater variety of features in it. The best part about this animated pictures app is that it does not put any watermark over the final image.</p>
<p>The app can animate still photos and convert them into short, loop videos. This is done by the programming of the directional cues into the image which is executed by dragging actions of the thumb across your mobile screen.</p>
<p>Although, on MotionLeap, without the pro version, the photo will be saved in video format.</p>

<p>We might already be acquainted with GIPHY as the most popular search engine for GIFs. Although, what’s unknown is that GIPHY has a mobile app both for Android and iOS which can be used to create GIFs and animate photos.</p>
<p>The app’s key advantage is its highly intuitive and very easy to use interface that makes it really easy to animate photos with the GIPHY app. Above all, it is completely free to use and along with animating pictures, you can also add captions to your animated photos or even capture short videos.</p>

<p>Movepic is another excellent app for animating pictures. As an animated pictures app, it is quite similar to MotionLeap owing to the fact that it animates still photos.</p>
<p>A downside of the Movepic free version is that it puts a watermark on the image and you cannot remove it without upgrading to the premium version or VIP account. The app saves the final images as a movie file and not as a GIF.</p>

<p>ImgPlay also comes with a range of advanced and easy-to-understand controls. This app, in spite of all its perks, puts a watermark on the image—which, once again, cannot be removed unless you buy the premium version of the app.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-The-10-Best-Makers-to-Turn-Photos-to-Caricature-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-The-10-Best-Makers-to-Turn-Photos-to-Caricature-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects"></a>Part 1 <strong>The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects</strong></h2><p>As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps that we can find. We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

<h3 id="02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker"><a href="#02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker" class="headerlink" title="02Color Cartoon Caricature Maker"></a>02<strong>Color Cartoon Caricature Maker</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>caricature maker</strong> app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a <strong>political caricature</strong> of famous individuals and politicians. It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<h3 id="07Caricature-Hyper-Face-Morph"><a href="#07Caricature-Hyper-Face-Morph" class="headerlink" title="07Caricature Hyper Face Morph"></a>07<strong>Caricature Hyper Face Morph</strong></h3><p>Now we go back to what most people usually consider ‘caricature’ with the ‘Caricature Hyper Face Morph’ app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in <strong>political caricature</strong> segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)</p>
<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature"><a href="#08Face-Caricature" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-1"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-1" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-1"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-1" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature-1"><a href="#08Face-Caricature-1" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p><strong>Cartoon character drawing</strong> is usually a vital aspect of any child’s life who loves to watch cartoon series and can sometimes be someone’s favorite thing in the world.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: “learning.” Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician’s assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.</p>
<p>Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of <strong>cartoon character drawing</strong> and practice some <strong>easy, simple cartoon drawing</strong> before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw cartoons characters"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them?

Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: “learning.” Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician’s assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.</p>
<p>Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of <strong>cartoon character drawing</strong> and practice some <strong>easy, simple cartoon drawing</strong> before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw cartoons characters"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-3"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>
