<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing <strong>cool cartoon drawings</strong> that will match different audiences, both older and younger.</p>

<p>Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of <strong>cartoon character drawing</strong> and practice some <strong>easy, simple cartoon drawing</strong> before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="how to draw cartoons characters"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you’re going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.</p>
<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to sketch drawing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>

                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

<p>A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child’s life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.</p>
<p>However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them?

<p>Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of <strong>cartoon character drawing</strong> and practice some <strong>easy, simple cartoon drawing</strong> before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>

However, we will cover the basic principles of <strong>easy cartoon drawing for beginners</strong> step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:</p>

                      alt="how to draw cartoons characters"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a pencil to begin your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a horizontal line at the center.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a “U” shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel “U” shape and connect it with the oval.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw the eye using two upside-down “U” shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Erase the pencil afterward.</p>
<p>Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-3"><a href="#Part-1-Cartoon-Easy-Drawing-with-Colour-Step-by-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step"></a>Part 1 <strong>Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step</strong></h2><p>Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to <strong>cartoon easy drawing</strong> a flower using a colored pencil:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg"
                      alt="how to draw with colour 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to “fill in” the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw with colour 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a “color sandwich.” Repeat this “ burnishing “ process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.</p>
<p>Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.</p>
<p>Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying “freckles” of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.</p>

It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you’re going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.</p>
<p>Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to sketch drawing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle’s edge to create the bump.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers&#x2F;creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms &amp; Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                      alt="create travel map video with pictramap "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview the Animation</strong></p>
<p>Click the <strong>View Animation</strong> button from the upper-right corner of the page to see the <strong>animated travel map</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>
<p>Once everything is complete, click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the <strong>Preview</strong> window to review your work.

<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img

                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers&#x2F;creators of the symbols while using their objects.

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-3"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers&#x2F;creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms &amp; Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>
<p><img

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change image settings</p>
<p>After finalizing the best preview for your edited files, you can hit the file menu option and then save your project for device or web option. It will immediately open a dialogue box where users can easily specify their image quality and loop count details. Never forget to have one more preview before saving the final results.</p>

                      alt="looping counts to combine"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Save your project</p>
<p>As now you are done with all the editing tasks so it is time to hit the “Save” option and then provide your destination address to the modified file. Your animated GIF file is now ready to get uploaded on the internet.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-gifs.jpg"
                      alt="preview gifs GIF combining maker"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change image settings</p>
<p>After finalizing the best preview for your edited files, you can hit the file menu option and then save your project for device or web option. It will immediately open a dialogue box where users can easily specify their image quality and loop count details. Never forget to have one more preview before saving the final results.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="looping counts to combine"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Save your project</p>
<p>As now you are done with all the editing tasks so it is time to hit the “Save” option and then provide your destination address to the modified file. Your animated GIF file is now ready to get uploaded on the internet.</p>
