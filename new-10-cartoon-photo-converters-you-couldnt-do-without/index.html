In the current scenario, email marketers are revamping the boundaries of email design by including well-done animated GIFs to showcase their services and products in action.</p>
<p>Here is a collection of 5 beautiful samples of well-done animated GIFs in email marketing that proved to be very creative, engaging, and colorful.</p>
<h3 id="1-ShoeMint-3"><a href="#1-ShoeMint-3" class="headerlink" title="1. ShoeMint"></a>1. ShoeMint</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-4.gif"
                      alt="shoemint"
                ></p>
<p>This cute GIF syncs pretty well with the ShoeMint’s email marketing template’s title – “C’mon, Get Happy!.” You can smile when you see the colorful socks swaying in a carefree manner.</p>
<h3 id="2-Mr-Porter-3"><a href="#2-Mr-Porter-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Mr. Porter"></a>2. Mr. Porter</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-3.gif"
                      alt="mr porter"
                ></p>
<p>This is an animated fireplace in the email marketing newsletter of Mr. Porter. It gives a pretty cozy and warm feel and atmosphere to the entire image, which is what they’re looking for or wandering for with the casual clothes the man is wearing.</p>
<h3 id="3-American-Apparel-3"><a href="#3-American-Apparel-3" class="headerlink" title="3. American Apparel"></a>3. American Apparel</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-1.gif"
                      alt="american apparel"
                ></p>
<p>American Apparel sells “power washed” T-shirts to make them “super soft.”</p>
<p>This critical merit would not attract many users if it weren’t for simulating the animated GIF of the T-shirts getting washed in an imaginary washing machine.</p>
<h3 id="4-Looper-3"><a href="#4-Looper-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Looper"></a>4. Looper</h3><p><img

                      alt="looper"
                ></p>
<p>One of the major motion pictures was Looper, that introduced us to the world’s first “official” GIF movie poster when the film premiered. The clock GIF inside the first O is exclusively creative, and the incredible animated dust effect suggests that both characters are fading away due to the events in the movie.</p>
<h3 id="5-West-Elm-3"><a href="#5-West-Elm-3" class="headerlink" title="5. West Elm"></a>5. West Elm</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
