<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 All You Need to Know About Rigging"></a>Part 1 <strong>All You Need to Know About Rigging</strong></h2><p>For this first part, we’re going to talk about <strong>Rigging</strong> in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

<h3 id="03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software"><a href="#03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="03What is Animation Rigging Software?"></a>03<strong>What is Animation Rigging Software?</strong></h3><p>Now, for the last section of this <strong>Rigging</strong> overview, let’s talk about <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

<h3 id="02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations"><a href="#02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Time Investments for Creating and Animations"></a>02<strong>Time Investments for Creating and Animations</strong></h3><p>Next, let’s talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Best-Rigging-Animation-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Best-Rigging-Animation-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?"></a>Part 3 <strong>What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?</strong></h2><p>For this final section of the guide, we’re finally moving on to our introduction to <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker"><a href="#05Animaker" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro"><a href="#06Moho-Pro" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D"><a href="#07Pencil-2D" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz"><a href="#08OpenToonz" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging-1"><a href="#Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 All You Need to Know About Rigging"></a>Part 1 <strong>All You Need to Know About Rigging</strong></h2><p>For this first part, we’re going to talk about <strong>Rigging</strong> in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-1"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation-1"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

<h3 id="03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software-1"><a href="#03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="03What is Animation Rigging Software?"></a>03<strong>What is Animation Rigging Software?</strong></h3><p>Now, for the last section of this <strong>Rigging</strong> overview, let’s talk about <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-1"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-1" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-1"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-1" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom-1"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom-1" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio-1"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate-1"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate-1" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-2"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-2" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom-2"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom-2" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio-2"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate-2"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate-2" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker-2"><a href="#05Animaker-2" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro-2"><a href="#06Moho-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D-2"><a href="#07Pencil-2D-2" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz-2"><a href="#08OpenToonz-2" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-2"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-2" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 All You Need to Know About Rigging"></a>Part 1 <strong>All You Need to Know About Rigging</strong></h2><p>For this first part, we’re going to talk about <strong>Rigging</strong> in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-3"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation-3"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

<h3 id="03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software-3"><a href="#03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="03What is Animation Rigging Software?"></a>03<strong>What is Animation Rigging Software?</strong></h3><p>Now, for the last section of this <strong>Rigging</strong> overview, let’s talk about <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-3"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-3" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

<h3 id="02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations-3"><a href="#02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Time Investments for Creating and Animations"></a>02<strong>Time Investments for Creating and Animations</strong></h3><p>Next, let’s talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

<h3 id="3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan"><a href="#3-Excel-Saga-Banned-in-Japan" class="headerlink" title="3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)"></a>3. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

<h3 id="4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China"><a href="#4-Death-Note-Banned-in-China" class="headerlink" title="4. Death Note (Banned in China)"></a>4. Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

<h3 id="6-High-School-DxD-Banned-in-New-Zealand"><a href="#6-High-School-DxD-Banned-in-New-Zealand" class="headerlink" title="6. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)"></a>6. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)</h3><p>Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps <em>THE</em> most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Kite (Banned in Norway)</h3><p>Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show’s first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.</p>

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

Death Note (Banned in China)</h3><p>Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.</p>

Attack on Titan (Banned in China)</h3><p>Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<h3 id="1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-3"><a href="#1-Shoujo-Tsubaki-Banned-Everywhere）-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）"></a>1. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）</h3><p>It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.</p>

The series’ first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more.

Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)</h3><p>Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it’s too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.</p>

High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.</p>

Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)</h3><p>Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni <em>Puny Poemy</em> is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.</p>

Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)</h3><p>Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.</p>

So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?</p>

Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.</p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>

                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>

                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg"
                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg"
                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Draw-Cartoon-Step-by-Step-Easy-Pencil-Drawing-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Draw-Cartoon-Step-by-Step-Easy-Pencil-Drawing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing"></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing</strong></h2><p>An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.</p>
<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg"
                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg"
                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg"
                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="01Modern-Cartoon-Style"><a href="#01Modern-Cartoon-Style" class="headerlink" title="01Modern Cartoon Style"></a>01Modern Cartoon Style</h3><p>This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.</p>
<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Dexter’s Laboratory</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Codename: Kids Next Door</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Gravity Falls</p>
<h3 id="02Realistic-Cartoon-Style"><a href="#02Realistic-Cartoon-Style" class="headerlink" title="02Realistic Cartoon Style"></a>02Realistic Cartoon Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>
<p>Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ugly Americans</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> General Caricataures</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Archer</p>

Modern-day drawings of this style have a lot of shadows and highlights in their character and environment, giving them a relatively new level of complexity.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> My Hero Academia</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sword Art Online</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Attack on Titan</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</p>
<h3 id="04Classic-Manga"><a href="#04Classic-Manga" class="headerlink" title="04Classic Manga"></a>04Classic Manga</h3><p>The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.</p>
<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>
<p>A few examples of classic manga possessing this <strong>cartoon style drawing</strong> are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Oh My Goddess</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Urusei Yatsura</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sailor Moon</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Bottle Fairy</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Himouto! Umaru-chan</p>

<p>Some remarkable examples of this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> are</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cinderella</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beauty and the Beast</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Mickey Mouse</p>

<p>More fluid animation is possible as a result of this. The art is also quite brilliant, with vibrant hues that leap off the screen.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the characters’ eyes are usually tiny (with a few exceptions), and the lines are skinny.</p>

<p>The perfect, if not the best, place to begin <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> as an artist is drawings or sketches since you don’t need a lot of drawing equipment to start this type of drawing. What you chiefly need is just your pen and paper to begin.</p>
<p>So, let’s move ahead as this content will show you different <strong>cartoon drawing styles</strong>, and in no time, you’ll master the art.</p>

<p>02 [How To Draw Myself In Five Different Cartoon Styles](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Cartoon-You-May-Use-for-Your-Next-Marketing-Project-3"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Cartoon-You-May-Use-for-Your-Next-Marketing-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project"></a>Part 1 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project</h2><p>As I’ve mentioned before, there are various types and styles of cartoon drawings. Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="01Modern-Cartoon-Style-3"><a href="#01Modern-Cartoon-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="01Modern Cartoon Style"></a>01Modern Cartoon Style</h3><p>This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.</p>
<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Dexter’s Laboratory</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Codename: Kids Next Door</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Gravity Falls</p>
<h3 id="02Realistic-Cartoon-Style-3"><a href="#02Realistic-Cartoon-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="02Realistic Cartoon Style"></a>02Realistic Cartoon Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>
<p>Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ugly Americans</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> General Caricataures</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Archer</p>
<h3 id="03Modern-Anime-3"><a href="#03Modern-Anime-3" class="headerlink" title="03Modern Anime"></a>03Modern Anime</h3><p>This style tends to be more complex, primarily seen in drawings where the characters seem to be in motion, like in comic books. Modern-day drawings of this style have a lot of shadows and highlights in their character and environment, giving them a relatively new level of complexity.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> My Hero Academia</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sword Art Online</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Attack on Titan</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</p>
<h3 id="04Classic-Manga-3"><a href="#04Classic-Manga-3" class="headerlink" title="04Classic Manga"></a>04Classic Manga</h3><p>The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.</p>
<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>
<p>A few examples of classic manga possessing this <strong>cartoon style drawing</strong> are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Oh My Goddess</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Urusei Yatsura</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sailor Moon</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Hellsing</p>
<h3 id="05Chibi-Drawing-Style-3"><a href="#05Chibi-Drawing-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="05Chibi Drawing Style"></a>05Chibi Drawing Style</h3><p>The Chibi <strong>Cartoon Drawing Style</strong> mainly focuses on making the characters into a tiny version of themselves as if being compressed or compacted into a small container.</p>
<p>Examples of where this drawing style is used:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lucky Star</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bottle Fairy</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Himouto! Umaru-chan</p>
<h3 id="06The-Simpsons-Cartoon-Drawing-Style-3"><a href="#06The-Simpsons-Cartoon-Drawing-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="06The Simpsons Cartoon Drawing Style"></a>06The Simpsons Cartoon Drawing Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> is widely famous. Though this style has undergone some evolution throughout the years, the main features remained constant! That is to say, the yellow bodies and big and white sphere-like eyes remained.</p>
<h3 id="07Classic-Disney-3"><a href="#07Classic-Disney-3" class="headerlink" title="07Classic Disney"></a>07Classic Disney</h3><p>This drawing style was a staple for years, though this drawing style has had an evolutionary cartoon drawing style over the years.</p>
<h3 id="08Mid-20th-Century-Disney-3"><a href="#08Mid-20th-Century-Disney-3" class="headerlink" title="08Mid 20th Century Disney"></a>08Mid 20th Century Disney</h3><p>Disney upped their game during the mid 20th century and started working more with live actors, drawing from references, and filming shots before drawing the cartoons.</p>
<p>Some remarkable examples of this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> are</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cinderella</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beauty and the Beast</p>
<h3 id="09Modern-Disney-Drawing-Style-3"><a href="#09Modern-Disney-Drawing-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="09Modern Disney Drawing Style"></a>09Modern Disney Drawing Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> is an immediate improvement of the mid-20th 20th drawing style. This cartoon style is brighter, more detailed, and more complex generally.</p>
<p>Although Disney has stopped creating 2D cartoon drawings, there are still some examples of this more refined art style:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Princess and the Frog</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lilo and Stitch</p>
<h3 id="10Old-Cartoon-Drawing-Style-3"><a href="#10Old-Cartoon-Drawing-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="10Old Cartoon Drawing Style"></a>10Old Cartoon Drawing Style</h3><p>This drawing style is mostly in black and white format, with very high contrast body parts. The features of this style are having short bodies and long limbs. Sometimes, this type of drawing is referred to as Noodle drawing because the character’s body moves as if there are no bones in their body.</p>
<p>Some examples of this <strong>cartoon drawing</strong> <strong>style</strong> include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mickey Mouse</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Betty Boop</p>
<h3 id="11South-Park-3"><a href="#11South-Park-3" class="headerlink" title="11South Park"></a>11South Park</h3><p>South Park <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is aptly geometric and has little depth. Shadows or highlights in this cartoon-style are rare. The colors are pretty solid and clean.</p>
<h3 id="12Chrono-Trigger-Dragon-Ball-Akira-Toriyama-3"><a href="#12Chrono-Trigger-Dragon-Ball-Akira-Toriyama-3" class="headerlink" title="12Chrono Trigger&#x2F; Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama)"></a>12Chrono Trigger&#x2F; Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama)</h3><p>Akira Toriyama’s <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> characterizes having big and almost rectangular eyes and a lot of geometric shapes and definitions in the muscles.</p>
<h3 id="13Crayon-Shin-Chan-3"><a href="#13Crayon-Shin-Chan-3" class="headerlink" title="13Crayon Shin-Chan"></a>13Crayon Shin-Chan</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> is effortless. An exciting aspect of this style is that it doesn’t mind pushing the limits of the character.</p>
<p>The lines generally are thin, and the eyes are prominent in black and white colors.</p>
<h3 id="14Betty-Boop-3"><a href="#14Betty-Boop-3" class="headerlink" title="14Betty Boop"></a>14Betty Boop</h3><p> Betty Boop’s <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> possesses contrasting black and white colors. Fragile lines with the characters contain a very high amount of black shapes.</p>
<h3 id="15Adventure-Time-3"><a href="#15Adventure-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="15Adventure Time"></a>15Adventure Time</h3><p>Adventure Time’s art is incredibly geometric, and its characters are nearly boneless, making it a more current example of a cartoon drawing style.</p>
<p>More fluid animation is possible as a result of this. The art is also quite brilliant, with vibrant hues that leap off the screen.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the characters’ eyes are usually tiny (with a few exceptions), and the lines are skinny.</p>
