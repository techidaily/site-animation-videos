<p><strong>●</strong> Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cinderella</p>

The number of photos you will have to take depends on the duration of the GIF you want to create, and it varies from just five to more than one thousand.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can also create GIFs from video files, but you should keep in mind that the sound is going to be removed automatically, as GIF files cannot contain audio.</p>

<p>In case you want to create a GIF out of photos, you will have to take a number of consecutive photos with your camera and then merge them into a GIF. The number of photos you will have to take depends on the duration of the GIF you want to create, and it varies from just five to more than one thousand.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can also create GIFs from video files, but you should keep in mind that the sound is going to be removed automatically, as GIF files cannot contain audio.</p>

<p>“So I am in high school, <strong>Cons</strong>idering an animation class. Currently, we use this to make a claymation. I have noticed a few complexities with it. The camera does not aim well, which is a big hassle. It also <strong>Cons</strong>ists of a glitch where sometimes, if you hit the undo frame, it will delete all your other projects. When that happened to me, I was not happy. Now, this last part may just be nitpicking, but when I saw the official company’s animation, I saw their fingers in it, and the animation was not smooth.”</p>
