<p>Playing with the words or graphic elements was never seen by the people before the motion graphics. Later it’s started used in mostly all films and ad videos.</p>

Sometimes things are very hard to explain with the still images whereas with the help of a few seconds of motion graphics you can clear everything perfectly.</p>
<p>If we talk about animation then this is a term under which motion graphics falls. Animation is used for more than 1years. So, we can say motion graphics are a part of animation itself. Any technique in the world which helps users to move static images or objects is known as animation. It can be Claymation, anime, cartoons, or motion graphics.</p>
<p>Mainly the content separates the motion graphics from the other types of animations because, in the motion graphic text, objects are associated with the other graphic designs.</p>

Sometimes things are very hard to explain with the still images whereas with the help of a few seconds of motion graphics you can clear everything perfectly.</p>
<p>If we talk about animation then this is a term under which motion graphics falls. Animation is used for more than 1years. So, we can say motion graphics are a part of animation itself.

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

<h3 id="02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker"><a href="#02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker" class="headerlink" title="02Color Cartoon Caricature Maker"></a>02<strong>Color Cartoon Caricature Maker</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>caricature maker</strong> app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a <strong>political caricature</strong> of famous individuals and politicians. It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<h3 id="07Caricature-Hyper-Face-Morph"><a href="#07Caricature-Hyper-Face-Morph" class="headerlink" title="07Caricature Hyper Face Morph"></a>07<strong>Caricature Hyper Face Morph</strong></h3><p>Now we go back to what most people usually consider ‘caricature’ with the ‘Caricature Hyper Face Morph’ app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in <strong>political caricature</strong> segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)</p>
<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature"><a href="#08Face-Caricature" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-1"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-1" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-1"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-1" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature-1"><a href="#08Face-Caricature-1" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-2"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-2" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-2"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-2" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature-2"><a href="#08Face-Caricature-2" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<h3 id="012D-Animation"><a href="#012D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="012D Animation"></a>012D Animation</h3><p>animations are trendy <strong>cartoon styles.</strong> This style of animation needs no introduction. This type of <strong>anime cartoon style</strong> was produced by Walt Disney. The most exciting features of the images were that they had only two dimensions: height and width.</p>
<p>Even though several people suggested that 2D <strong>art styles cartoon</strong> were invented during the early twentieth century. Back then, it was not much popular; Walt Disney made these <strong>cartoon styles</strong> famous. Example:</p>

<h3 id="02Traditional-Animation"><a href="#02Traditional-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Traditional Animation"></a>02Traditional Animation</h3><p>As the name suggests, traditional Animation is an <strong>old cartoon art style.</strong> These cartoon styles were first seen in the year 1877. Emil Reynaud discovered a new tool for demonstrating objects that are moving. In this type of Animation, all the images are drawn manually on paper with a pencil. This method of making <strong>cartoon styles</strong> is time-consuming. However, later computer applications and programs were developed, making this task much easier and more efficient. Example:</p>

<h3 id="03Animation"><a href="#03Animation" class="headerlink" title="03Animation"></a>03Animation</h3><p>animation <strong>cartoon styles</strong> came into existence with graphics and visual software development. The first 3D dimensional image was created in the year 1972. However, an attempt to make 3D Animation was made in 1961. Nowadays, 3D Animation is a widely used animation style. It is used in the entertainment industry and medical imaging to adequately explain the body and organisms. Example:</p>

<h3 id="04Flipbook-Animation"><a href="#04Flipbook-Animation" class="headerlink" title="04Flipbook Animation"></a>04Flipbook Animation</h3><p>In flipbook animation, each frame is drawn on each notebook page.

Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures.

Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.</p>
<h3 id="05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional"><a href="#05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional" class="headerlink" title="05Marketing To Medical Professional"></a>05Marketing To Medical Professional</h3><p>While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background.

It’s a very open subject.</p>
<h3 id="01GIFs-Are-Easy-to-Share-Ads"><a href="#01GIFs-Are-Easy-to-Share-Ads" class="headerlink" title="01GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads"></a>01<strong>GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads</strong></h3><p>The best part of GIFs is that they are easily consumable media that you can share just about everywhere. For example, you can include them in your email marketing to bring a little life to what could have otherwise been a very dry message You can also have it play out on social media without prompting (different from videos, which the user usually has to play before it starts going.)</p>

Eye-catching in a way that keeps you looking to catch the movement — in compared to if you were just looking at a still image (which might catch your attention for a moment, but usually bores you the next)</p>

Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving’ pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.</p>

Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example. With just one look, you can probably create an entire story in your head about the woman that is featured This can be very useful for future marketing prospects.</p>

Only, it’s a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below</p>

Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving’ pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.</p>

Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example. With just one look, you can probably create an entire story in your head about the woman that is featured This can be very useful for future marketing prospects.</p>

Only, it’s a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below</p>
