Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

<p>We do have a couple of recommendations to give. There’s a wide variety of tools out there that will allow you to <strong>make animated pictures</strong>.

<p>Have a look at our list of the top ten best <strong>photos to animation converter</strong> tools below to see if one of them catches your eye.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s get straight to our list of the best photo to animation converter tools available. As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety — including both software and online photo animator tools so that you can find one that best suits the kind of projects that you’re working on.</p>
<p>For your convenience, we’ve included the pros and cons of each converter as well as the most common scenarios each application can be used.</p>

<p>When it comes to <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

<p>When it comes to <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

It is lip-syncing which brings life to the characters and makes them look talking. The process of lip-syncing in animations includes the dialogues and the mouth charts. The dialogues are broken into the phonetic syllables and the frames required for these syllables are then accessed.</p>
<p>Animations are moving and talking images and liveliness come from the dialogues that they speak. So, to make these talks appear real, flawless lip-syncing is very important.</p>

Some of these important ones are enlisted below.</p>
<h3 id="01-Perfect-Match-of-the-Keyframes"><a href="#01-Perfect-Match-of-the-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="01 Perfect Match of the Keyframes"></a>01 Perfect Match of the Keyframes</h3><p>The keyframes for the shapes of the words phrase by phrase needs to be perfect to make it look right. The right lip sync will have the correct timings from the mouth open to the mouth close.</p>
<h3 id="02-Adding-Body-Language"><a href="#02-Adding-Body-Language" class="headerlink" title="02 Adding Body Language"></a>02 Adding Body Language</h3><p>To make the characters in your animations look real and lively, adding gestures and body language will play a huge role. Moreover, lip-syncing along with facial expressions will add to the overall richness of the animations.</p>

In these videos, you can speak and observe the jaw motion.</p>
<h3 id="04-Use-Blending"><a href="#04-Use-Blending" class="headerlink" title="04 Use Blending"></a>04 Use Blending</h3><p>The technique of blending can also be used where the focus is on the most important shape of the mouth rather than each syllable.

<h3 id="05-Emphasize-Eyes"><a href="#05-Emphasize-Eyes" class="headerlink" title="05 Emphasize Eyes"></a>05 Emphasize Eyes</h3><p>Eyes need special focus as they can be used for expressing several emotions.

It is lip-syncing which brings life to the characters and makes them look talking. The process of lip-syncing in animations includes the dialogues and the mouth charts. The dialogues are broken into the phonetic syllables and the frames required for these syllables are then accessed.</p>
<p>Animations are moving and talking images and liveliness come from the dialogues that they speak. So, to make these talks appear real, flawless lip-syncing is very important.</p>

<h3 id="05-Emphasize-Eyes-3"><a href="#05-Emphasize-Eyes-3" class="headerlink" title="05 Emphasize Eyes"></a>05 Emphasize Eyes</h3><p>Eyes need special focus as they can be used for expressing several emotions.
