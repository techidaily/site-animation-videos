You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>
<p>● A4 Documents</p>
<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>
<p>● YouTube Thumbnails</p>
<p>● Presentation</p>
<p>● Flyer&#x2F;Poster</p>
<p>● Instagram Logo</p>
<p>● Infographic</p>
<p>These options generate the ability to be presented in both portrait and landscape mode. The multitude of options makes it an ideal medium for you to create your animation. The animation options at Canva also come with the opportunity to animate an existing image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Free Animated Presentation"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>

<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>

<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>

You can select an animation from one of the pre-existing animated templates. This is a time-saving option as it lets you customize ready-made templates to suit your needs</p>
<p>With the pre-set animation templates, you have the option to choose from among</p>
<p>● Invitations</p>
<p>● A4 Documents</p>
<p>● Instagram Post</p>
<p>● Facebook Post</p>

<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>

Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-3"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>

<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>

<p>Making an overall excellent and unique <strong>character design cartoon art style</strong> is sometimes hard. The truth is that everyone has a favorite cartoon character, but the question is, how does this character come to life? While you are about to start copying other well-known cartoon or comic characters, you will eventually branch out and come with your own. In addition, there are several ways to come up with ideas for cartoon characters’ concept art to draw. Any of these ways can get you started on populating your world of cartoons.</p>

<p>More so, the process of tackling your character design is often full of hurdles. This process requires a lot of creative thinking to create one’s character from the beginning, although many well-known characters from films, advertising, and cartoons look straightforward. But need to exert a vast amount of skill and effort to make them effective.</p>

They are;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Do not lose the magic</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.</p>
<p>The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="cartoon character design tips 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Avoid reference material</strong></p>
<p>Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn’t have the reference material right in front of you as you work.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make research on other characters</strong></p>
<p>For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Also, take a look elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character’s posture or idea’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Try not to lose sight of the original idea</strong></p>
<p>It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Exaggerate</strong></p>
<p>When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters’ essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Decide the aim of your character design</strong></p>
<p>When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your ‘thing.’ Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make your character distinctive</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create clear silhouettes</strong></p>
<p>A silhouette is required to help you understand the character’s gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character ‘reads’ and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Consider line quality</strong></p>
<p>Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.</p>

They are;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Do not lose the magic</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.</p>
<p>The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.</p>

                      alt="cartoon character design tips 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Avoid reference material</strong></p>
<p>Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn’t have the reference material right in front of you as you work.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make research on other characters</strong></p>
<p>For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Also, take a look elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character’s posture or idea’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Try not to lose sight of the original idea</strong></p>
<p>It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Exaggerate</strong></p>
<p>When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters’ essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.</p>

Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Consider line quality</strong></p>
<p>Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it.

They are;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Do not lose the magic</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.</p>
<p>The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.</p>

                      alt="cartoon character design tips 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Avoid reference material</strong></p>
<p>Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn’t have the reference material right in front of you as you work.</p>
<p>Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make research on other characters</strong></p>
<p>For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Also, take a look elsewhere</strong></p>
<p>It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character’s posture or idea’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Try not to lose sight of the original idea</strong></p>
<p>It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Exaggerate</strong></p>
<p>When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters’ essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Decide the aim of your character design</strong></p>
<p>When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your ‘thing.’ Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make your character distinctive</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create clear silhouettes</strong></p>
<p>A silhouette is required to help you understand the character’s gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character ‘reads’ and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>   <strong>Consider line quality</strong></p>
<p>Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>

<p>To add a GIF to your photo or video, scroll down and select one. You can also use the search option to locate more particular GIFs by entering a term or phrase.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step 3: Drag GIF</strong></p>
<p>Drag the GIF you added to the screen’s desired location.</p>
<p>Pinch your screen to change the GIF’s size as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save and Share</strong></p>
<p>You can then share your Snap with other social networking platforms by sending it to your Stories, friends&#x2F;contacts, or just saving it to your gallery.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p>You can use the same snap to apply many stickers. Drag and drop it on the trashcan icon to get rid of it.</p>

<p>• Download the Gboard from the Play Store or whichever playstore you want.</p>
<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>
<p>• Double-check that Gboard is selected as your primary keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, grant any permissions it requires so that you can use it right away in Snapchat.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-GIFs-on-Snapchat-Snaps-and-Messages-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-GIFs-on-Snapchat-Snaps-and-Messages-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Get GIFs on Snapchat Snaps and Messages?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Get GIFs on Snapchat Snaps and Messages?</strong></h2><p>Getting a <strong>GIF on Snapchat</strong> can be tasking, but here is a simple guide to achieving that.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-6.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p>You can use the same snap to apply many stickers. Drag and drop it on the trashcan icon to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get Gboard on your Android device if it didn’t come with it:</p>
<p>• Download the Gboard from the Play Store or whichever playstore you want.</p>
<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>
<p>• Double-check that Gboard is selected as your primary keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, grant any permissions it requires so that you can use it right away in Snapchat.</p>
<p>Now that it’s as simple as it gets, let’s send comparable GIFs utilizing iOS devices.</p>
<p>For iPhone&#x2F;iPad:</p>
<p>For iPhone users, you must first download and install the giphy app on your phone. Once you have successfully set the giphy app as your default keyboard, you can send <strong>Snapchat GIFs</strong> chat by following the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Press the Globe icon</strong></p>
<p>Continuously press and hold the globe icon to the left of the space bar to reveal the available keyboard, then choose a specific or favorite GIF from the giphy list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-7.jpg.png"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Find GIF</strong></p>
<p>Find the GIF you wish to send and tap it to copy it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-8.jpg.png"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Paste GIF</strong></p>
<p>Return to the conversation, paste the GIF into the text box, and press the send button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-9.jpg.png"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p>For those who don’t know how to use the Giphy app on their iPhones or iPads, read the following instructions:</p>
<p>• Go to the Settings menu and pick the General icon.</p>
<p>•To see your keyboard options, go to the keyboard setting and tap it.</p>
<p>• To see the accessible keyboard, tap on the part labelled keyboard.</p>
<p>• Select Add a New Keyboard.</p>
<p>• The Giphy keyboard will undoubtedly be among the third-party keyboards.</p>
<p>• Once you’ve included or added the keyboard, it’ll appear in the “active keyboard” section.</p>
<p>• Select the Allow Full Access option.</p>
