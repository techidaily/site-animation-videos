<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

<h3 id="02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker"><a href="#02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker" class="headerlink" title="02Color Cartoon Caricature Maker"></a>02<strong>Color Cartoon Caricature Maker</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>caricature maker</strong> app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a <strong>political caricature</strong> of famous individuals and politicians. It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<h3 id="07Caricature-Hyper-Face-Morph"><a href="#07Caricature-Hyper-Face-Morph" class="headerlink" title="07Caricature Hyper Face Morph"></a>07<strong>Caricature Hyper Face Morph</strong></h3><p>Now we go back to what most people usually consider ‘caricature’ with the ‘Caricature Hyper Face Morph’ app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in <strong>political caricature</strong> segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)</p>
<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature"><a href="#08Face-Caricature" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="09Cartoon-Caricature-Face-Camera"><a href="#09Cartoon-Caricature-Face-Camera" class="headerlink" title="09Cartoon Caricature Face Camera"></a>09<strong>Cartoon Caricature Face Camera</strong></h3><p>This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-1"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-1" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-1"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo-1" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature-1"><a href="#08Face-Caricature-1" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-2"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-2" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-2"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-2" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature-2"><a href="#08Face-Caricature-2" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>“<strong>Text Animation</strong>“ refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!</p>

<p>Adobe Animate is Adobe’s very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It’s also the one that we’d recommend if you’re looking into advanced <strong>adobe animate text animation</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects"></a>Part 3 <strong>5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects</strong></h2><p>Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>
<h3 id="01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets"><a href="#01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets" class="headerlink" title="01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets"></a>01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets</h3><p>The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.</p>

To clarify, you add ‘animators’ to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a ‘selector’ in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated.

<p>Adobe Animate is Adobe’s very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It’s also the one that we’d recommend if you’re looking into advanced <strong>adobe animate text animation</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects"></a>Part 3 <strong>5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects</strong></h2><p>Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>

After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.</p>

To clarify, you add ‘animators’ to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a ‘selector’ in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.</p>

<p>Adobe Animate is Adobe’s very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It’s also the one that we’d recommend if you’re looking into advanced <strong>adobe animate text animation</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects"></a>Part 3 <strong>5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects</strong></h2><p>Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>
<h3 id="01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets-3"><a href="#01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets-3" class="headerlink" title="01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets"></a>01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets</h3><p>The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.</p>

<h3 id="02METHOD-2-After-Effects-Text-Animators-3"><a href="#02METHOD-2-After-Effects-Text-Animators-3" class="headerlink" title="02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators"></a>02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators</h3><p>If the presets aren’t working out for you, you can also try out After Effect’s “animators” and “selectors”. To clarify, you add ‘animators’ to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a ‘selector’ in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.</p>

This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a “Text” preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!</p>

<h3 id="04METHOD-4-Path-Animation-3"><a href="#04METHOD-4-Path-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04METHOD 4: Path Animation"></a>04METHOD 4: Path Animation</h3><p>The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we’ve introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.</p>

It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4–which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.</p>

<p>In the recent few years, videos have become the primary tool for marketers to attract their target customers. Unlike banners and pamphlets, videos are relatively more engaging and make it easier for marketers to establish a connection with the viewers. Now, each brand has different preferences when it comes to choosing the right video marketing strategy.</p>
<p>While some brands opt for conventional video advertisements, others get a bit creative and introduce <strong>graphics animation</strong> to their videos to make them more captivating. Of course, if you want to maximize the user’s attention and retain more customers, you would prefer the latter. Animated videos are more engaging and also sets the brand apart from the rest of the crowd.</p>

The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.</p>
<p>However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why <strong>graphics and animations</strong> should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.</p>
<p>Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.</p>

While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.</p>

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.</p>
<h3 id="02Animations"><a href="#02Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02Animations</h3><p>Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of <strong>graphics animations.</strong> However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text&#x2F;objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.</p>
<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.</p>

Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="01Start-With-a-Template"><a href="#01Start-With-a-Template" class="headerlink" title="01Start With a Template"></a>01Start With a Template</h3><p>Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.</p>
<p>Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.</p>

Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.</p>

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand.

<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape.

Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your <strong>motion graphics animation.</strong></p>

Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.</p>

<h3 id="04Design-Multiple-Variations-3"><a href="#04Design-Multiple-Variations-3" class="headerlink" title="04Design Multiple Variations"></a>04Design Multiple Variations</h3><p>It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A&#x2F;B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.</p>
<h3 id="05Use-GIF-Format-3"><a href="#05Use-GIF-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="05Use GIF Format"></a>05Use GIF Format</h3><p>Finally, once your <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.</p>
