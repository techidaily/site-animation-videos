<p>Our topic for today’s article is on that exact same subject. Or, rather, more specifically, <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong>.</p>
<p>For those who want more than the usual robotic text-to-speech AI that you see in more professional software. Learn more about all this below, we’ve prepared an entire guide for you!</p>

Starting with:</p>
<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube"></a>Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube</h2><p>If you want to create your own <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Reading Speed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Starting with:</p>
<h3 id="01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-1"><a href="#01How-did-text-to-speech-get-popular-1" class="headerlink" title="01How did text to speech get popular?"></a>01How did text to speech get popular?</h3><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.</p>
<h3 id="02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-1"><a href="#02How-to-get-the-most-realistic-sounding-text-to-speech-1" class="headerlink" title="02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?"></a>02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?</h3><p>There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we’ll be introducing in the latter sections:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Text-to-Speech-Videos-for-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube"></a>Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube</h2><p>If you want to create your own <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Readers Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                      alt="Natural Readers - Reading Speed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-1"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-1" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a tone that suits your taste.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.</p>

For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Compose Your Text</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Voice &#x2F; Reader</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!</p>
<p>Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to choose your desired reading speed!</p>
<p>Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Output Format</strong></p>
<p>And finally, to finish us off, it’s time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-2"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-2" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel &gt; Speech page for the option to apply it there.</p>

Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes <strong>text-to-speech cartoon characters</strong> and <strong>text-to-speech anime characters</strong> voices!</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier-2"><a href="#01Flixier-2" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>

                      alt="Flixier Online Video Editor"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord-2"><a href="#02Woord-2" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

                      alt="Woord"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Speechelo-2"><a href="#03Speechelo-2" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4-2"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4-2" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A wide variety of voice options to choose from.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05TTS-Reader-2"><a href="#05TTS-Reader-2" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available to use online for FREE.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable speed for voice.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-2"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-2" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it’s important that you’re aware of all the different options out there!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you’ll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, you’ll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.</p>

There are many of these available. Although, you’ll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-3"><a href="#01Method-1-Windows-Text-to-Speech-Voices-3" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices"></a>01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices</h3><p>If you’re looking to change your computer’s text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel &gt; Speech’. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> creations.</p>

For this list, we’ve not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:</p>
<h3 id="01Flixier-3"><a href="#01Flixier-3" class="headerlink" title="01Flixier"></a>01Flixier</h3><p>Flixier is the first <strong>anime text-to-speech</strong> maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you’ll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Flixier comes with many different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It comes with advanced team functionalities.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Woord-3"><a href="#02Woord-3" class="headerlink" title="02Woord"></a>02Woord</h3><p>Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you’ll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Instant text-to-speech maker.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An online tool, no need for download or installation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.</p>

<h3 id="03Speechelo-3"><a href="#03Speechelo-3" class="headerlink" title="03Speechelo"></a>03Speechelo</h3><p>Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it’s really more of a ‘voice-over-maker’. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Works in several different languages.</p>

<h3 id="04Cartoon-Animator-4-3"><a href="#04Cartoon-Animator-4-3" class="headerlink" title="04Cartoon Animator 4"></a>04Cartoon Animator 4</h3><p>Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you’re really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Free-to-use <strong>text-to-speech anime character</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A wide variety of voice options to choose from.</p>

<h3 id="05TTS-Reader-3"><a href="#05TTS-Reader-3" class="headerlink" title="05TTS Reader"></a>05TTS Reader</h3><p>TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon&#x2F;anime characters. It doesn’t have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you’re looking for is something easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Available to use online for FREE.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of different voice options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjustable speed for voice.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it’s important that you’re aware of all the different options out there!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you’ll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, you’ll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Draw-Captain-America"><a href="#02How-to-Draw-Captain-America" class="headerlink" title="02How to Draw Captain America"></a>02How to Draw Captain America</h3><p>Follow these simple steps to make a Disney cartoon drawing of Captain America:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Draw his arm and waist</p>
<p>Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Draw his legs</p>
<p>Here, we shall portray Captain America in action. Use curved lines to show his extended right leg with boots. The left leg should appear more petite.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Draw his shield</p>
<p>Against his right arm, carefully draw a flattened circular shape. You can achieve this by drawing concentric circles with a large star in the middle. Draw his arm poking out from behind his shield.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other. Sketch too long curved lines to show the mouth and small blonde triangles for the teeth. Above the eyes and nose, draw curved lines.</p>

<p>Unarguably, Mickey Mouse is one of the most famous anime characters globally. This character was created in 1928 and is a famous <strong>Disney cartoon drawing</strong> by animators. Here are straightforward steps to help you draw a Mickey Mouse:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Sketch the general but carefully observed features of Mickey Mouse, including the position of ears, body shape (reverse C shape), body proportions including eyes, limbs, and arms, length of arms, button on his pants, and angle on the hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw the head and chest</p>
<p>Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other.

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw a circle that would form Stitch’s head</p>
<p><img

                      alt="draw a circle for its head"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Using a long curved line, draw an irregular peanut shape beneath the head to represent its body.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Draw Stitch’s arm using curved lines for the upper arm and another pair for the lower arm. Draw his bent hands and fingers using short lines. At the tip of its fingers, draw small pointed triangles to represent its claws.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Draw Stitch’s outstretched arm using a pair of curved lines and small “C” shaped lines to represent the fingers. Use short lines to connect the fingers. Draw small “V” shapes at the tip of the fingers for the triangular claws.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other. Sketch too long curved lines to show the mouth and small blonde triangles for the teeth. Above the eyes and nose, draw curved lines.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Take your pencil and paper, and using gentle and weak strokes, make a simple sketch of the head, neck, belly, and limbs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Draw a circle that would form Stitch’s head</p>
<p><img

                      alt="draw a circle for its head"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Using a long curved line, draw an irregular peanut shape beneath the head to represent its body.</p>

                      alt="draw the body pattern"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch’s body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small “V” shapes to indicate the presence of fur.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Draw Stitch’s outstretched arm using a pair of curved lines and small “C” shaped lines to represent the fingers. Use short lines to connect the fingers. Draw small “V” shapes at the tip of the fingers for the triangular claws.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other.

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

<p>There has been an advancement in the cartoon since the last publication made by “Paste” (a 5,800-word short story by Henry James). However, traditional cable networks have created exciting and new worlds and characters. Various streaming platforms like YouTube have allowed different creators to <strong>draw cartoon videos</strong> and publish them as they want. It has long been said that cartoons are specifically made for kids to enjoy on Saturday morning, but this is no longer the case as adults now enjoy watching cartoons in their free time.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

<h3 id="01Futurama-2"><a href="#01Futurama-2" class="headerlink" title="01Futurama"></a>01Futurama</h3><p>This <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that’s pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.</p>
