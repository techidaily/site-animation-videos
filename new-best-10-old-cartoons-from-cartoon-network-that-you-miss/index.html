<p>Drawings will always have a special place in storytelling. Whether you are demonstrating a new concept to a child, highlighting the features of a product to your bosses, or showcasing the intricacies of a marketing campaign, drawings make it easier for the audience to understand what is being said.</p>
<p>That is why it is so important to learn how to <strong>create whiteboard animation</strong>.

Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>

Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.</p>

Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script-2"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.</p>

You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.</p>
<p>By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.</p>

<p>The dedication in anime goes even beyond the lively visuals and complex plotlines. You will find powerful and spunk anime girl characters leading the show. Not to mention the unique <strong>anime girl name</strong> that is often linked to the characters’ roles in the plot, values, or personality. These interesting names with deep meanings have been a focus of attention for many anime fans.</p>
<p>From adorable and cool-sounding names to sweet names with spiritual meaning, there are all kinds of <strong>anime girl names.</strong> Let’s look at some fun cases where a character’s name is just as necessary as any other information to disclose their nature and purpose.</p>

They are listed in alphabetical order:</p>
<h3 id="1-Asuka-tomorrow-smell-perfume"><a href="#1-Asuka-tomorrow-smell-perfume" class="headerlink" title="1. Asuka: tomorrow, smell, perfume"></a>1. Asuka: tomorrow, smell, perfume</h3><p>Asuka is a Japanese <strong>anime girl name</strong> which means tomorrow; smell, perfume, collectively its smell of tomorrow.

<h3 id="2-Bashira-joyful-and-a-predictor-of-good-news"><a href="#2-Bashira-joyful-and-a-predictor-of-good-news" class="headerlink" title="2. Bashira: joyful and a predictor of good news"></a>2. Bashira: joyful and a predictor of good news</h3><p>Bashira is a Japanese <strong>anime</strong> <strong>name</strong> that means joyful and a predictor of good news. Being an anime girl character, this name adds a translation of her appearance and the purposes of her character in the series. We agree that anime is not for everyone since their deeply planned names always help people get the unclear meanings and hidden purposes of characters.</p>
<h3 id="3-Chika-scatter-flower"><a href="#3-Chika-scatter-flower" class="headerlink" title="3. Chika: scatter, flower"></a>3. Chika: scatter, flower</h3><p>Chika is a popular feminine Japanese <strong>anime name.</strong> It can be written with the kanji characters (chi), meaning thousand, wisdom, intellect, or scatter combined with (ka), meaning “flower.” This name gives us the concept of a strong girl, who can be both; strong girls with delicacy.</p>
<h3 id="4-Dai-great"><a href="#4-Dai-great" class="headerlink" title="4. Dai: great"></a>4. Dai: great</h3><p>Its origin is Japan; Dai is a female-given name that is pronounced dah-ee. Dai means “great; to shine,” and it is of Japanese and Welsh origin. Greatness has always been everyone’s preference; anime girl characters have also been portrayed as goddesses many times.</p>
<h3 id="5-Erza-Scarlet-the-gift-of-God"><a href="#5-Erza-Scarlet-the-gift-of-God" class="headerlink" title="5. Erza Scarlet: the gift of God"></a>5. Erza Scarlet: the gift of God</h3><p>According to the name and its meaning, Erza played a very restricted role, and following the rules is all she wanted. Erza means the gift of God; this term is often termed as enhanced wisdom, knowledge, and faith.</p>
<h3 id="6-Fujiko-wisteria"><a href="#6-Fujiko-wisteria" class="headerlink" title="6. Fujiko: wisteria"></a>6. Fujiko: wisteria</h3><p>Fujiko means Wisteria which is a name of a flower that perfectly portrays the feminity of a girl and strength.</p>
<h3 id="7-Gizmodo-–-black-clover"><a href="#7-Gizmodo-–-black-clover" class="headerlink" title="7. Gizmodo – black clover"></a>7. Gizmodo – black clover</h3><p>Gizmodo is a dark Japanese name that means black clover.

                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>
<p> You also have the option to move the GIF image on the page by clicking and dragging the image to the location that you want to place the picture.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Copy-and-Paste"><a href="#Method-2-Copy-and-Paste" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Copy and Paste"></a>Method 2: Copy and Paste</h4><p> A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first. Then, paste your image on the Powerpoint slide by pressing Control + V.</p>
<p> You can also highlight the file name, and then use the drag and drop feature to put your image directly into the Powerpoint slide of your choice.</p>

You can achieve this function by using the Insert Ribbon’s Pictures icon.</p>
<p> Select Pictures, then write in the image URL directly in the File input box. Then, select Insert. The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.</p>
<p> Here we recommend the method 1 and 2, the method 3 will take a little time while Powerpoint downloading the GIF picture.</p>
