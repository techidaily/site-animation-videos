Script is the Essence"></a>1. Script is the Essence</h4><p>If you wish to understand the nuances of how to make an animation, the first step you should know is scripting.</p>
<p>Playing with the words in your mind and weaving them on paper makes a big difference. So, penning a story helps you to recognize the loopholes, the pace, and the character development in your story.</p>
<p>The script gives a person an idea of where your story is based, how does it look or at which time of the day are you talking about, who is talking to whom, and most importantly, the dialogues, what are your story characters say to one another. The script is the essence of creating animation and without it, you cannot resume the process of animation.</p>

<h4 id="2-Storyboarding"><a href="#2-Storyboarding" class="headerlink" title="2. Storyboarding"></a>2. Storyboarding</h4><p>What is storyboarding? It is a sequence of images or pre-visualization of movie shots to understand how exactly the story will unveil, the feel, the look, the camera angles, everything is described like a flowchart.</p>
<p>Storyboarding can be of various types. It may be colorful, it may just an outline, or black and white or something with complete detail. A storyboard must give a complete and close image of what the movie would look like.</p>
<p>The images must be captioned, the movement of the camera must be shown with arrows, and the object and characters must be differentiated from the background with colors.</p>

<h4 id="3-Voiceover"><a href="#3-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="3. Voiceover"></a>3. Voiceover</h4><p>If you want to make your animation more vivid and interesting, remember to add voiceover. Would you like to see an animated movie without a voice? It is a vital part of any movie recording.</p>
<p>When you ask how to make an animation, you also need to know how to record a voiceover. The animation is influenced by voice performance for focus and timing of a scene. The animated scene and the voiceover must be in sync perfectly in order to retain the attention of the viewers.</p>
<p>In the earlier days, a recording studio used to be rented and a sound engineer and voiceover artist was hired for it. But, today the auditions for VO are done online and the best one with professional recording tools is hired.</p>

Script is the Essence"></a>1. Script is the Essence</h4><p>If you wish to understand the nuances of how to make an animation, the first step you should know is scripting.</p>
<p>Playing with the words in your mind and weaving them on paper makes a big difference. So, penning a story helps you to recognize the loopholes, the pace, and the character development in your story.</p>
<p>The script gives a person an idea of where your story is based, how does it look or at which time of the day are you talking about, who is talking to whom, and most importantly, the dialogues, what are your story characters say to one another. The script is the essence of creating animation and without it, you cannot resume the process of animation.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>

<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-8"><a href="#In-this-article-8" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>

<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG"
                      alt="delete animation folder unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject"></a>02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject</h3><p>Now, you may have different subjects. We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG"
                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator"><a href="#01Add-the-animator" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG"
                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation"><a href="#03Create-an-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG"
                      alt="delete keyframe unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum"><a href="#04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum" class="headerlink" title="04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum"></a>04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum</h3><p>With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG"
                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG"
                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img

We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG"
                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-1"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-1" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-1"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-1" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG"
                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-1"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="delete keyframe unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-1"><a href="#04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-1" class="headerlink" title="04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum"></a>04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum</h3><p>With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG"
                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation-1"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG"
                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-10"><a href="#In-this-article-10" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>

<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-2"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-2" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-2"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-2" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-2"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="delete keyframe unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-2"><a href="#04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-2" class="headerlink" title="04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum"></a>04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum</h3><p>With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG"
                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation-2"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG"
                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-11"><a href="#In-this-article-11" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>

<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>

<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-3"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-3" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-3"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-3" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-3"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img

Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation-3"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

Even though the application is mostly used to edit images, it can also help you develop all kinds of funny good morning&#x2F;night GIFs.</p>
<p>To do that, you need to work on different layers in Photoshop and then merge them as a single frame to provide a more animated appeal. Here are some basic steps that you can follow to come up with anime good night or morning GIFs.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Launch-Photoshop-and-Load-Media-Assets"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-Photoshop-and-Load-Media-Assets" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Launch Photoshop and Load Media Assets"></a>Step 1 Launch Photoshop and Load Media Assets</h5><p>You can start by launching Adobe Photoshop on your system and visiting its File &gt; Scripts section to load your media files.</p>

<p><img

                      alt="photoshop add layer"
                ></p>
<p>Since it is recommended to have a timeline for your media, you can go to its Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view at the bottom.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
