<p><strong>●</strong> Take Care of the File Size</p>
<p>The credibility of LinkedIn carousel posts lies in the engaging presentation of your static and monotonous text to make them stand out of the crowded newsfeed. True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a Commendable File Format</p>
<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make a Careful Upload</p>
<p>When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bonus Tip</p>
<p>To include the latest and up-to-date information within your presentation, consider visiting the LinkedIn official webpage directly from your platform account.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Take Care of the File Size</p>
<p>The credibility of LinkedIn carousel posts lies in the engaging presentation of your static and monotonous text to make them stand out of the crowded newsfeed. True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a Commendable File Format</p>
<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make a Careful Upload</p>
<p>When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bonus Tip</p>
<p>To include the latest and up-to-date information within your presentation, consider visiting the LinkedIn official webpage directly from your platform account.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation"><a href="#023D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations"><a href="#Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations"></a>Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations</h2><p>The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation-1"><a href="#023D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>

While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation-3"><a href="#023D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations-3"><a href="#Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations"></a>Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations</h2><p>The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>
<p>The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly.

<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>

<p>Today there is a lot pre-made skeletons you can use and reuse as many times as you want, making only a few minor adjustments to the base design. If your creativity is sparking like firecrackers, then a rig can make it look more defined and&#x2F;or realistic.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Let’s talk more about <strong>Rigging Animation</strong>.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>
<h3 id="04Intro-to-Rigging-Software"><a href="#04Intro-to-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="04Intro to Rigging Software"></a>04Intro to Rigging Software</h3><p>You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.</p>
<p>Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.</p>
<p>Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>

<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work-3"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used-3"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used-3" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>
<h3 id="04Intro-to-Rigging-Software-3"><a href="#04Intro-to-Rigging-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="04Intro to Rigging Software"></a>04Intro to Rigging Software</h3><p>You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.</p>
