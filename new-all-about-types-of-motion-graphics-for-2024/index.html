<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated-2"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first.

These days you can do whatever you want online so animating still pictures should be a piece of cake if you know-how.</p>
<p>A video is basically an entire collage of moving pictures. So if you can cut out pictures from a video why not turn still pictures into animations.</p>
<p><strong>There are a number of ways you can use to animate still images →</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Videos are multiple pictures that move at a frame rate. Make short copies of a video by cutting out the essential moments and playing them in a loop.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add and play video animation elements over a picture. With the right software, this task is as easy as copy-pasting over another image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply an animated 3D image with a transparent background over another image. Remember, the bigger the element the closer it is. So size is directly translated as distance.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can use multiple filters and effects on an image with an <strong>animated portrait app</strong>. Find out what app you can use further on in this article.</p>
