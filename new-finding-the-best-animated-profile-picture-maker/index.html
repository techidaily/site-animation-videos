<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>
<p><img

<p>When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to <strong>convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop</strong>, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.

Traditional animation"></a>1. Traditional animation</h4><p>As you would expect, this type of animation is the kind of old classic animation drawn on paper. The characters, backgrounds and layout were normally committed to paper by hand, with each drawing being slightly different from its predecessor. The papers were placed on sheets called cels before paint was added to them. Advancements in technology mean animation can be hand-drawn before color is added via software.</p>
<p>Synfig Studio is a popular product for those wishing to produce videos that are traditional in look and feel. It supports a variety of layers and offers a bone system as well as sound support.</p>
<h4 id="2-2D-animation"><a href="#2-2D-animation" class="headerlink" title="2. 2D animation"></a>2. 2D animation</h4><p>With 2D animation, movement is created in a two-dimensional environment. Characters and figures can move up, down, left or right but won’t move nearer or further away from the viewer. Many <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animated video software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be used to make this kind of video.

<h4 id="4-Clay-animation"><a href="#4-Clay-animation" class="headerlink" title="4. Clay animation"></a>4. Clay animation</h4><p>Clay animation is also called claymation and has been around for many years. In clay animation, clay pieces are used to create characters and background animation. The pieces are moved or deformed between frames so continuous motion can occur.</p>
<p>One leading solution for clay animation is Adobe Animate CC. With this product, you can create vector animations for apps, games, videos and more. You can publish the results quickly and can animate pretty much anything, allowing your characters to walk, talk, blink and more with ease.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to create illusions of depths via the enhanced camera tool, and new features are being added all the time.</p>
<h4 id="5-HTML-animation"><a href="#5-HTML-animation" class="headerlink" title="5. HTML animation"></a>5. HTML animation</h4><p>HMTL5 allows you to do all sorts of things including elements of video and animation creation.

<p>Videos involving kinetic typography animation can help you demand the attention of your audience. One very popular tool for creating kinetic typography animation is Renderforest.</p>
<p>This solution is ideal even for those without vast technical expertise and helps you create animations, music visualizations, slideshows and much more in mere moments. Trailers, YouTube openings, logo animations are frequently created with the tool, as are explainer animations and whiteboard videos, to give you just a few more examples.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Once you have found the types of animated videos and tools that appeal to you the most and have created your content, you can put magical finishing touches to your videos by using Filmora.</p>
