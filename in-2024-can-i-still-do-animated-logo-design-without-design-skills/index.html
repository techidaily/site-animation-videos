<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                      alt="how to draw a cartoon face 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Drawing Cartoon Hair</strong></p>

For example, the eyes’ shape and size will help determine if the person is feeling sad, excited, happy, excited, or sad. In addition, the amount of lift under a person’s eyebrows can help determine whether a person is mad or not.</p>
<p>These facial expressions are crucial to how a person communicates. It has got to the point that we can read someone’s face without truly understanding which parts of the face convey that emotion. However, these days we get exposed to everyday adaptations of facial expressions, especially with the invention of Instagram, Snapchat, and cartoon face filters.</p>
<p>Consequently, cartoons are a combination of different shapes that are being put together and are not difficult if the focus is on each shape individually and the process breaks down step by step.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Plan and Prepare</strong></p>
<p>This is the first step is to plan out exactly what this character will convery through its expression while drawing a cartoon character.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Drawing A Cartoon Head</strong></p>
<p>Next is time to start sketching out the shape of the head based on the plan you have made. Whatsoever shape you decide to use for your character, start with a circle to serve as the basic shape for the head.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Drawing Cartoon Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Now, you need to draw the eye of the character, which is a crucial step because the eye is the essential part of their expression. To get the character’s eyes in the right place, you should carefully sketch the horizontal or vertical dimension lines.</p>

                      alt="how to draw a cartoon face 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Drawing A Cartoon Nose</strong></p>
<p>The simpler the nose is, the better it looks in a cartoon. Ensure to keep a proper ratio between the mouth, eyes, and nose so that it does not look too crowded together.</p>

                      alt="how to draw a cartoon face 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Shaping the Face</strong></p>
<p>In shaping the face, one needs to be mindful of the character, which will help to determine how to shape the jawline and head. For example, for a girl, the face should be narrower and have the chin come to a bit of a point at the end, whereas, for a boy, it requires that the face is a bit bolder and focuses more on the definition of the jawline.</p>

                      alt="how to draw a cartoon face 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Drawing A Cartoon Mouth</strong></p>
<p>The mouth is another essential part of the cartoon character’s expression and a key indicator of how the character is feeling. It portrays whether you want the character to smile, frown, yell, be nervous, or be neutral.</p>

                      alt="how to draw a cartoon face 04"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Drawing Cartoon Hair</strong></p>
<p>Next, you need to draw the cartoon hair, and, in some cases, the cartoon hair is a significant part of their appearance as it is a way to convey your character’s personality, appearance, style, or gender.</p>
