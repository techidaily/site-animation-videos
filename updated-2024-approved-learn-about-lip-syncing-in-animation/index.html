It is lip-syncing which brings life to the characters and makes them look talking. The process of lip-syncing in animations includes the dialogues and the mouth charts. The dialogues are broken into the phonetic syllables and the frames required for these syllables are then accessed.</p>
<p>Animations are moving and talking images and liveliness come from the dialogues that they speak. So, to make these talks appear real, flawless lip-syncing is very important.</p>

<h4 id="1-2D-Animation"><a href="#1-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="1.  2D Animation"></a>1.  2D Animation</h4><p>Let’s start with 2D as our fist animation style, which is the traditional or oldest form in practice for more than 100 years since 1908. 2D has widely been in usage to create animated short films, cartoon characters, games, marketing videos, and educational materials. In 2D animation, the characters or items, creatures, and backgrounds get crafted in a two-dimensional space. It produces a graphic of movement with the drawings played serially one after another.</p>

Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.</p>

<h4 id="3-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#3-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="3.  Motion Graphics"></a>3.  Motion Graphics</h4><p>Our next animation style is motion graphics of the animated graphic design, where text appears to be the main enhancing factor. It is a piece of animation or digital footage that illuminates a motion or notation incorporated with audio. It is a new way of communicating to the audience and in driving them deep into the story. You can categorize it under the visual effect technique, which involves the movement of graphic images or elements like logos or text, sound, music, and motion. Motion graphics are best to be found in action and finds a place in multimedia projects, advertising agencies, branding, television title making, and storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Software</strong>: Tools that are best for motion graphics is Mocha AE, After Effects, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D.</p>
<p>The world is a great place, but we always forget another beautiful hidden green world behind the fantastic buildings we reside in. Yes, “Beautiful World” is a motion graphic video by Blasterjaxx &amp; DBSTF feat. Ryder presents how we humans have developed a great empire by destroying the other beautiful part of the world.</p>
<h4 id="4-Stop-Motion"><a href="#4-Stop-Motion" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stop Motion"></a>4.  Stop Motion</h4><p>Stop motion is one of the traditional animation styles that is the most popular filmmaking technique that uses hand-crafted or manipulated objects, mostly clay models. Puppets, silhouettes, and cut-outs can also be implemented as stop motion aids to produce animation. It is labor-intensive, a form of art, and has its flavor in animation, although 3D and visual effects have replaced it quite a long time before.
