<p>Although MotionLeap is free to use there’s a Pro and subscription version with a greater variety of features in it. The best part about this animated pictures app is that it does not put any watermark over the final image.</p>
<p>The app can animate still photos and convert them into short, loop videos. This is done by the programming of the directional cues into the image which is executed by dragging actions of the thumb across your mobile screen.</p>
<p>Although, on MotionLeap, without the pro version, the photo will be saved in video format.</p>

<p>You can freeze parts of an image.</p>
<p>Variety of filters can be applied.</p>
<p>Although MotionLeap is free to use there’s a Pro and subscription version with a greater variety of features in it. The best part about this animated pictures app is that it does not put any watermark over the final image.</p>
<p>The app can animate still photos and convert them into short, loop videos. This is done by the programming of the directional cues into the image which is executed by dragging actions of the thumb across your mobile screen.</p>
<p>Although, on MotionLeap, without the pro version, the photo will be saved in video format.</p>

<p>We might already be acquainted with GIPHY as the most popular search engine for GIFs. Although, what’s unknown is that GIPHY has a mobile app both for Android and iOS which can be used to create GIFs and animate photos.</p>
<p>The app’s key advantage is its highly intuitive and very easy to use interface that makes it really easy to animate photos with the GIPHY app. Above all, it is completely free to use and along with animating pictures, you can also add captions to your animated photos or even capture short videos.</p>

<p>Movepic is another excellent app for animating pictures. As an animated pictures app, it is quite similar to MotionLeap owing to the fact that it animates still photos.</p>
<p>A downside of the Movepic free version is that it puts a watermark on the image and you cannot remove it without upgrading to the premium version or VIP account. The app saves the final images as a movie file and not as a GIF.</p>
