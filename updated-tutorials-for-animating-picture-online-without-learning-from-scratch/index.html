To do this, they need to move to files and then from drop down menu select Export as. Soon a menu will open where you need to choose your output file format as GIF and adjust weight and height parameter to reduce physical dimensions of your image.</p>
<p>In case if you are using Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 then on its interface, users need to move to File and then hit Save for Web option. It will help to open a Save for Web type dialogue box immediately, on this new window you can apply desired changes to physical dimensions of your content, reduce color information and apply dithering etc.</p>
<p> <strong>3. Adjust number of colors in image:</strong></p>

<p>One of the most useful tricks for marketers is to optimize size of their GIF images by adjusting total number of colours to it. It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.</p>
<p> <strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can also reduce number of frames in their GIFs.</li>
<li>Never forget to avoid dithering as it may help to improve appearance of images.</li>
<li>It is essential work with loss less compression algorithms otherwise huge loss in information will be carried out.</li>
<li>Interlacing is not good option for your GIFs as it causes significant increase in overall file size.</li>

These files use to have small size so they can be transferred and downloaded with ease and at faster rate. If you are interested to know about various resizing concepts related to GIFs then the article below can be helpful for you.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-reduce-GIF-size-3"><a href="#How-to-reduce-GIF-size-3" class="headerlink" title="How to reduce GIF size?"></a>How to reduce GIF size?</h2><p>There are so many things that contribute in managing overall size of GIFs. The list includes the colour count inside, dimensions of images that you have used for development of GIFs and number of frames included inside one GIF folder. In case if it is an animated GIF then size may increase accordingly. Somehow, if you become able to optimize your Gifs then it is much easier to share them over internet.</p>
<p>Photoshop is a great tool to edit your image, including gif images. Here we are going to show you how to make your GIF smaller in Photoshop.</p>

                ></p>

<p>The very first task for users is to bring your GIF video file onto Photoshop timeline. Sometimes, it is not essential to update whole series of your GIF animation to the library, the GIF can be simply trimmed at timeline panel. One needs to turn on loop option and then be active enough to allocate the right place to trim your video.</p>
<p> <strong>2. Reduce dimensions of Output:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Those who are working on Photoshop CC 2017 version will be able to develop GIFs by simply executing Explore As option from menu. To do this, they need to move to files and then from drop down menu select Export as. Soon a menu will open where you need to choose your output file format as GIF and adjust weight and height parameter to reduce physical dimensions of your image.</p>
<p>In case if you are using Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 then on its interface, users need to move to File and then hit Save for Web option. It will help to open a Save for Web type dialogue box immediately, on this new window you can apply desired changes to physical dimensions of your content, reduce color information and apply dithering etc.</p>
<p> <strong>3. Adjust number of colors in image:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>One of the most useful tricks for marketers is to optimize size of their GIF images by adjusting total number of colours to it. It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.</p>
<p> <strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can also reduce number of frames in their GIFs.</li>
<li>Never forget to avoid dithering as it may help to improve appearance of images.</li>
<li>It is essential work with loss less compression algorithms otherwise huge loss in information will be carried out.</li>
<li>Interlacing is not good option for your GIFs as it causes significant increase in overall file size.</li>

<p>Since the early 1900’s, cool male and <strong>female anime characters</strong> have been inspiring fans worldwide; you will find plenty of <strong>anime girl characters</strong> who are ferocious, smartass, or simply princesses with blue, red, or blonde hair and personalities so engaging and influencing.

                      alt="erza scarlet"
                ></p>
<p>Tall, beautiful, and a bit scary, Erza Scarlet is an S-class mage of the Fairy Tail Guild. As one of the leading female protagonists in Team Natsu, Erza feels great pride and shows dedication to the guild. She’s often seen in her custom-made armored suit, a blue skirt, and black boots with a blue Fairy Tail stamp on her upper left arm. But, changing her attire at any given time is never a problem for her, thanks to her Requip magic powers.</p>
<p>Anime fans love Erza for her strict yet clumsy personality. Her fighting and leadership skills in the war against Phantom Lord Guild have had fans in admiration.</p>

                      alt="kushina uzumaki"
                ></p>
<p>We love the nickname “Red hot-blooded Habanero,” Kushina earned when she attacked a bunch of kids who teased and laughed at her. Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure. She is the wife of Minato Namikaze and the mother of Naruto Uzumaki in the top-rated Naruto series. Despite a short temper and violent outbursts, Kushina possesses a soft and caring side most people love her for.</p>

                      alt="asuna anime character"
                ></p>
<p>Asuna Yuuki is one of the popular <strong>anime girl characters</strong> of our favorite Sword Art Online novel, manga, anime franchise. She is the deuteragonist and former Vice-commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath in Sword Art Online. Early on, Asuna was shown to be a strong fighter who did not care about dying until she met Kirito. However, Asuna is a bit overly serious, and as the SAO series progresses, she is shown nothing but the wife of Kirito.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Fate&#x2F;Stay Night’s Saber is the saber class servant of Kiritsugu Emiya in the Fourth Holy Grail War and Shirou Emiya in the Fifth Holy Grail War.. Serving her master with loyalty and devotion, Saber is a courageous and strong-willed <strong>female anime character.</strong> Fans around the world acknowledge her as a supremely skilled warrior with a kind heart, caring about the ones she loves.

                      alt="rias gremory"
                ></p>
<p>School’s number one beauty, the red-haired Rias Gremory, deserves a spot on our list. She is the only daughter of Zeoticus Venelana Gremory and the next head of the Gremory clan. We love when she is called the Crimson-haired Ruin Princess. While she has charming features, she is very kind and compassionate even to her servants – something which makes her a fan favorite,</p>
<h3 id="6-Nobara-Kugisaki-Jujutsu-Kaisen"><a href="#6-Nobara-Kugisaki-Jujutsu-Kaisen" class="headerlink" title="6. Nobara Kugisaki- Jujutsu Kaisen"></a>6. Nobara Kugisaki- Jujutsu Kaisen</h3><p><img

                      alt="nobara kugisaki"
                ></p>
<p>Out of the many unique anime characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara Kugosaki is a tough girl most anime fans are drawn to. She is one of the Jujutsu manga’s three primary protagonists who moved to Tokyo. Nobara isn’t your typical strong lady; she is confident and outspoken about her appearance and herself as a person.</p>
<p>As a rebellious fighter, she has shown superhuman pain tolerance while fighting foes even larger than herself. Nobara fans love her proficiency with various curse-infused weaponry, such as the hammer and nail, straw dolls, and the rubber mallet.</p>
<h3 id="7-Mikasa-Ackerman-Attack-on-Titan"><a href="#7-Mikasa-Ackerman-Attack-on-Titan" class="headerlink" title="7. Mikasa Ackerman-Attack on Titan"></a>7. Mikasa Ackerman-Attack on Titan</h3><p><img

                      alt="mikasa ackerman"
                ></p>
<p>As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best <strong>anime girl characters.</strong> The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Once a cheerful, outgoing, and innocent child living with her parents, Mikasa grows up to be quite stoic and dangerous at times. Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent’s brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.</p>

                      alt="motoko kusanagi"
                ></p>
<p>Who doesn’t know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body? Motoko Kusanagi is employed as an officer for Public Security Section 9, a Japanese National Public Safety Commission division. After the airplane accident in her childhood, Motoko was comatose until her consciousness was put into a prosthetic body. Since then, she has been an excellent hacker with incredible intelligence and combat skills respected among her colleagues. Motoko connects with the audience on a greater level, for she is strong, cool, intellectual, and artificial at the same time.</p>

                      alt="touka kirishima"
                ></p>
<p>Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki. Being a rugged, know-it-all kind of girl but with a touch of kindness, people adore Touka Kirishima.</p>

                      alt="tsukuyo anime character"
                ></p>
<p>Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as “Courtesan of Death.” She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.</p>
<h3 id="11-Lucy-Heartfilia-Fairy-Tail"><a href="#11-Lucy-Heartfilia-Fairy-Tail" class="headerlink" title="11. Lucy Heartfilia- Fairy Tail"></a>11. Lucy Heartfilia- Fairy Tail</h3><p><img

                      alt="lucy heartfilia"
                ></p>
<p>Lucy Heartfilia, an iconic anime girl from the Fairy Tail manga series, has the best character growth from the first episode to the last. When we first see her, she is a happy, innocent little girl who grows up to be a divine spirit mage and mother to seven children.</p>
<p>There are so many likable qualities about Lucy – she is fair and beautiful, responsible, with impressive magic skills, and a desire to become a world-famous author. Lucy Heartfilia leaves her home after her mother’s death with an ambition for independence, something admired by the fandom.</p>

                      alt="yui komori"
                ></p>
<p>Yui is living with Cordelia’s heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.</p>
<p>When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it’s not a surprise that Diabolik Lover’s Yui Komori is everyone’s favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there’s more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.</p>
<h3 id="13-Revy-Black-Lagoon"><a href="#13-Revy-Black-Lagoon" class="headerlink" title="13. Revy-Black Lagoon"></a>13. Revy-Black Lagoon</h3><p><img

                      alt="revy anime character"
                ></p>
<p>No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can’t really relate to this complex <strong>female anime character</strong> until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.</p>
<h3 id="14-Shoko-Nishimiya-A-Silent-Voice"><a href="#14-Shoko-Nishimiya-A-Silent-Voice" class="headerlink" title="14. Shoko Nishimiya- A Silent Voice"></a>14. Shoko Nishimiya- A Silent Voice</h3><p><img

                      alt="shoko nishimiya"
                ></p>
<p>This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it’s hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.</p>

                      alt="esdeath female anime-character"
                ></p>
<p>Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath’s spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General’s apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father’s death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.</p>

                      alt="erza scarlet"
                ></p>
<p>Tall, beautiful, and a bit scary, Erza Scarlet is an S-class mage of the Fairy Tail Guild. As one of the leading female protagonists in Team Natsu, Erza feels great pride and shows dedication to the guild. She’s often seen in her custom-made armored suit, a blue skirt, and black boots with a blue Fairy Tail stamp on her upper left arm. But, changing her attire at any given time is never a problem for her, thanks to her Requip magic powers.</p>
<p>Anime fans love Erza for her strict yet clumsy personality. Her fighting and leadership skills in the war against Phantom Lord Guild have had fans in admiration.</p>
<h3 id="2-Kushina-Uzumaki-Naruto-1"><a href="#2-Kushina-Uzumaki-Naruto-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Kushina Uzumaki-Naruto"></a>2. Kushina Uzumaki-Naruto</h3><p><img

                      alt="kushina uzumaki"
                ></p>
<p>We love the nickname “Red hot-blooded Habanero,” Kushina earned when she attacked a bunch of kids who teased and laughed at her. Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure. She is the wife of Minato Namikaze and the mother of Naruto Uzumaki in the top-rated Naruto series. Despite a short temper and violent outbursts, Kushina possesses a soft and caring side most people love her for.</p>

                      alt="asuna anime character"
                ></p>
<p>Asuna Yuuki is one of the popular <strong>anime girl characters</strong> of our favorite Sword Art Online novel, manga, anime franchise. She is the deuteragonist and former Vice-commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath in Sword Art Online. Early on, Asuna was shown to be a strong fighter who did not care about dying until she met Kirito. However, Asuna is a bit overly serious, and as the SAO series progresses, she is shown nothing but the wife of Kirito.</p>
<h3 id="4-Saber-Fate-Stay-Night-1"><a href="#4-Saber-Fate-Stay-Night-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Saber- Fate&#x2F;Stay Night"></a>4. Saber- Fate&#x2F;Stay Night</h3><p><img

                      alt="saber anime character"
                ></p>
<p>Fate&#x2F;Stay Night’s Saber is the saber class servant of Kiritsugu Emiya in the Fourth Holy Grail War and Shirou Emiya in the Fifth Holy Grail War.. Serving her master with loyalty and devotion, Saber is a courageous and strong-willed <strong>female anime character.</strong> Fans around the world acknowledge her as a supremely skilled warrior with a kind heart, caring about the ones she loves.

                      alt="rias gremory"
                ></p>
<p>School’s number one beauty, the red-haired Rias Gremory, deserves a spot on our list. She is the only daughter of Zeoticus Venelana Gremory and the next head of the Gremory clan. We love when she is called the Crimson-haired Ruin Princess. While she has charming features, she is very kind and compassionate even to her servants – something which makes her a fan favorite,</p>
<h3 id="6-Nobara-Kugisaki-Jujutsu-Kaisen-1"><a href="#6-Nobara-Kugisaki-Jujutsu-Kaisen-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Nobara Kugisaki- Jujutsu Kaisen"></a>6. Nobara Kugisaki- Jujutsu Kaisen</h3><p><img

                      alt="nobara kugisaki"
                ></p>
<p>Out of the many unique anime characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara Kugosaki is a tough girl most anime fans are drawn to. She is one of the Jujutsu manga’s three primary protagonists who moved to Tokyo. Nobara isn’t your typical strong lady; she is confident and outspoken about her appearance and herself as a person.</p>
<p>As a rebellious fighter, she has shown superhuman pain tolerance while fighting foes even larger than herself. Nobara fans love her proficiency with various curse-infused weaponry, such as the hammer and nail, straw dolls, and the rubber mallet.</p>
<h3 id="7-Mikasa-Ackerman-Attack-on-Titan-1"><a href="#7-Mikasa-Ackerman-Attack-on-Titan-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Mikasa Ackerman-Attack on Titan"></a>7. Mikasa Ackerman-Attack on Titan</h3><p><img

                      alt="mikasa ackerman"
                ></p>
<p>As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best <strong>anime girl characters.</strong> The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Once a cheerful, outgoing, and innocent child living with her parents, Mikasa grows up to be quite stoic and dangerous at times. Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent’s brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.</p>
<h3 id="8-Motoko-Kusanagi-Ghost-in-the-Shell-1"><a href="#8-Motoko-Kusanagi-Ghost-in-the-Shell-1" class="headerlink" title="8. Motoko Kusanagi-Ghost in the Shell"></a>8. Motoko Kusanagi-Ghost in the Shell</h3><p><img

                      alt="motoko kusanagi"
                ></p>
<p>Who doesn’t know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body? Motoko Kusanagi is employed as an officer for Public Security Section 9, a Japanese National Public Safety Commission division. After the airplane accident in her childhood, Motoko was comatose until her consciousness was put into a prosthetic body. Since then, she has been an excellent hacker with incredible intelligence and combat skills respected among her colleagues. Motoko connects with the audience on a greater level, for she is strong, cool, intellectual, and artificial at the same time.</p>

                      alt="touka kirishima"
                ></p>
<p>Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki. Being a rugged, know-it-all kind of girl but with a touch of kindness, people adore Touka Kirishima.</p>
<h3 id="10-Tsukuyo-Gintama-1"><a href="#10-Tsukuyo-Gintama-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Tsukuyo-Gintama"></a>10. Tsukuyo-Gintama</h3><p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-tsukuyo-anime-character.jpg"
                      alt="tsukuyo anime character"
                ></p>
<p>Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as “Courtesan of Death.” She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.</p>
<h3 id="11-Lucy-Heartfilia-Fairy-Tail-1"><a href="#11-Lucy-Heartfilia-Fairy-Tail-1" class="headerlink" title="11. Lucy Heartfilia- Fairy Tail"></a>11. Lucy Heartfilia- Fairy Tail</h3><p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-lucy-heartfilia.jpg"
                      alt="lucy heartfilia"
                ></p>
<p>Lucy Heartfilia, an iconic anime girl from the Fairy Tail manga series, has the best character growth from the first episode to the last. When we first see her, she is a happy, innocent little girl who grows up to be a divine spirit mage and mother to seven children.</p>
<p>There are so many likable qualities about Lucy – she is fair and beautiful, responsible, with impressive magic skills, and a desire to become a world-famous author. Lucy Heartfilia leaves her home after her mother’s death with an ambition for independence, something admired by the fandom.</p>
<h3 id="12-Yui-Komori-Diabolik-Lovers-1"><a href="#12-Yui-Komori-Diabolik-Lovers-1" class="headerlink" title="12. Yui Komori- Diabolik Lovers"></a>12. Yui Komori- Diabolik Lovers</h3><p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-yui-komori.jpg"
                      alt="yui komori"
                ></p>
<p>Yui is living with Cordelia’s heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.</p>
<p>When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it’s not a surprise that Diabolik Lover’s Yui Komori is everyone’s favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there’s more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.</p>
<h3 id="13-Revy-Black-Lagoon-1"><a href="#13-Revy-Black-Lagoon-1" class="headerlink" title="13. Revy-Black Lagoon"></a>13. Revy-Black Lagoon</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-revy-anime-character.jpg"
                      alt="revy anime character"
                ></p>
<p>No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can’t really relate to this complex <strong>female anime character</strong> until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.</p>
<h3 id="14-Shoko-Nishimiya-A-Silent-Voice-1"><a href="#14-Shoko-Nishimiya-A-Silent-Voice-1" class="headerlink" title="14. Shoko Nishimiya- A Silent Voice"></a>14. Shoko Nishimiya- A Silent Voice</h3><p><img

                      alt="shoko nishimiya"
                ></p>
<p>This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it’s hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.</p>
<h3 id="15-Esdeath-Akame-ga-Kill-1"><a href="#15-Esdeath-Akame-ga-Kill-1" class="headerlink" title="15. Esdeath- Akame ga Kill"></a>15. Esdeath- Akame ga Kill</h3><p><img

                      alt="esdeath female anime-character"
                ></p>
<p>Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath’s spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General’s apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father’s death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.</p>

As one of the leading female protagonists in Team Natsu, Erza feels great pride and shows dedication to the guild. She’s often seen in her custom-made armored suit, a blue skirt, and black boots with a blue Fairy Tail stamp on her upper left arm. But, changing her attire at any given time is never a problem for her, thanks to her Requip magic powers.</p>
<p>Anime fans love Erza for her strict yet clumsy personality. Her fighting and leadership skills in the war against Phantom Lord Guild have had fans in admiration.</p>

<p>We love the nickname “Red hot-blooded Habanero,” Kushina earned when she attacked a bunch of kids who teased and laughed at her. Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure.

She is the deuteragonist and former Vice-commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath in Sword Art Online. Early on, Asuna was shown to be a strong fighter who did not care about dying until she met Kirito. However, Asuna is a bit overly serious, and as the SAO series progresses, she is shown nothing but the wife of Kirito.</p>

<p>School’s number one beauty, the red-haired Rias Gremory, deserves a spot on our list. She is the only daughter of Zeoticus Venelana Gremory and the next head of the Gremory clan. We love when she is called the Crimson-haired Ruin Princess. While she has charming features, she is very kind and compassionate even to her servants – something which makes her a fan favorite,</p>

<p>Out of the many unique anime characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara Kugosaki is a tough girl most anime fans are drawn to. She is one of the Jujutsu manga’s three primary protagonists who moved to Tokyo. Nobara isn’t your typical strong lady; she is confident and outspoken about her appearance and herself as a person.</p>
<p>As a rebellious fighter, she has shown superhuman pain tolerance while fighting foes even larger than herself. Nobara fans love her proficiency with various curse-infused weaponry, such as the hammer and nail, straw dolls, and the rubber mallet.</p>

                ></p>
<p>As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best <strong>anime girl characters.</strong> The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Once a cheerful, outgoing, and innocent child living with her parents, Mikasa grows up to be quite stoic and dangerous at times. Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent’s brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body? Motoko Kusanagi is employed as an officer for Public Security Section 9, a Japanese National Public Safety Commission division. After the airplane accident in her childhood, Motoko was comatose until her consciousness was put into a prosthetic body. Since then, she has been an excellent hacker with incredible intelligence and combat skills respected among her colleagues. Motoko connects with the audience on a greater level, for she is strong, cool, intellectual, and artificial at the same time.</p>

<p>Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki. Being a rugged, know-it-all kind of girl but with a touch of kindness, people adore Touka Kirishima.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as “Courtesan of Death.” She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Lucy Heartfilia, an iconic anime girl from the Fairy Tail manga series, has the best character growth from the first episode to the last. When we first see her, she is a happy, innocent little girl who grows up to be a divine spirit mage and mother to seven children.</p>
<p>There are so many likable qualities about Lucy – she is fair and beautiful, responsible, with impressive magic skills, and a desire to become a world-famous author. Lucy Heartfilia leaves her home after her mother’s death with an ambition for independence, something admired by the fandom.</p>

                      alt="yui komori"
                ></p>
<p>Yui is living with Cordelia’s heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.</p>
<p>When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it’s not a surprise that Diabolik Lover’s Yui Komori is everyone’s favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there’s more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.</p>

                ></p>
<p>No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can’t really relate to this complex <strong>female anime character</strong> until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it’s hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath’s spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General’s apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father’s death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.</p>

<p>Tall, beautiful, and a bit scary, Erza Scarlet is an S-class mage of the Fairy Tail Guild. As one of the leading female protagonists in Team Natsu, Erza feels great pride and shows dedication to the guild. She’s often seen in her custom-made armored suit, a blue skirt, and black boots with a blue Fairy Tail stamp on her upper left arm. But, changing her attire at any given time is never a problem for her, thanks to her Requip magic powers.</p>

<p>We love the nickname “Red hot-blooded Habanero,” Kushina earned when she attacked a bunch of kids who teased and laughed at her. Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure. She is the wife of Minato Namikaze and the mother of Naruto Uzumaki in the top-rated Naruto series. Despite a short temper and violent outbursts, Kushina possesses a soft and caring side most people love her for.</p>

<p>As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best <strong>anime girl characters.</strong> The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.</p>

Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent’s brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body? Motoko Kusanagi is employed as an officer for Public Security Section 9, a Japanese National Public Safety Commission division. After the airplane accident in her childhood, Motoko was comatose until her consciousness was put into a prosthetic body.

<p>Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki.

                ></p>
<p>Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as “Courtesan of Death.” She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Yui is living with Cordelia’s heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.</p>
<p>When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it’s not a surprise that Diabolik Lover’s Yui Komori is everyone’s favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there’s more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.</p>

                ></p>
<p>No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can’t really relate to this complex <strong>female anime character</strong> until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it’s hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath’s spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General’s apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father’s death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.</p>
