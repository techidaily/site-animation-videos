Animation video is a craft in which images go through the process of conspiring, layout addition, and photographic chronology to create an illusion of action. In this article, let’s learn the importance of video animations and when and why to use this technique.</p>

<h2 id="What-are-Video-Animation-and-its-importance"><a href="#What-are-Video-Animation-and-its-importance" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Animation and its importance?"></a>What are Video Animation and its importance?</h2><p>Video as a marketing tool has become more popular but also more important. In this article, you can read more about why media marketing is getting more essential in comparison to text marketing. Therefore, an explainer video with Animation is an amazing way to show your target audience who you are, where you stand for, what you do and how you can solve the customer’s problem.</p>
<p>Video animation is an engaging technique that can help you comprehensively tell your story. Animated meaning can be better comprehended as a simulation of motion created by showing a series of pictures. Animated videos for a business catch the viewers and make for an enjoyable story-telling experience.</p>
<p>Often, animation videos are used to explain a concept or process. It’s straightforward to make these videos appealing and likable as you can primarily create them however you want. It can take longer to get the point across when people explain how to do something. Animations not only trigger emotions but spark conversations as well.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-most-common-types-of-Animation"><a href="#What-are-most-common-types-of-Animation" class="headerlink" title="What are most common types of Animation?"></a>What are most common types of Animation?</h2><p>The purpose of this article is to take you through the complexity of the different types of animation styles and methods. It also covers the track you should take (and what that path entails) to become an animator for each of the five types.</p>
<p>This guide is not about learning how to animate. But instead, it breaks down the five types of Animation available to you and what you’ll need to start animating: best software, schools, and courses.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Graphics (Key framing)</strong>: Motion graphics focus on making dynamic and exciting presentations of moving text logos and fundamental illustrations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion graphics can be 2D and 3D, and you’ll find them everywhere in news, sporting videos, the news, and other TV productions.</li>
<li>Correct character animation is generally outside the scope of motion graphics, but many core animation principles also apply to motion graphics.</li>
<li>Creating Motion Graphics depends on the plan used since video editing software often have different user interface or settings, but the idea is the same. Motion Graphics usually involves animating texts, pictures, or video clips using keyframing that is tweened to make a smooth motion between frames.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Traditional Animation</strong>: This is the classic type of Animation you’re probably most well known with. In the past, animators drew characters frame by frame, and then those pictures were moved onto transparent sheets for painting. That’s where the term animation comes from.</p>
<p>They started scanning drawings into the computer for digital coloring. The important thing is that hand-drawn animators still create their animation frame by frame using the same method and concept as in those old days of paper and cels.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora"></a>How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora</h2><p>Keyframes specify the start or end of a transition in a shot. A series of keyframes can give the semblance of the movement of an object. Keyframes include parameters such as Position, Scale, Opacity, and Rotation. These values can be changed and customized to make animations using keyframing.</p>

Even learners or novices can use keyframe animation to create extraordinary videos. Plus, the keyframe templates are an added satisfaction. If you have limited time and need a quick fix, using Presets in the Animation tab is your best bet.</p>
<p>For this example, we’ll walk you through using Keyframes on the short video clip to make your Animation using Wondershare Filmora.</p>

<p>Step1 Launch Wondershare Filmora from your system and select New Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="launch wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Import your selected images. In this case I imported no background images to have a clear view on how key framing works.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import animation file filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag or add the image on the Timeline Panel.</p>
<p>In this case I use a dove and a cloud to demo the Motion graphics animation</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/motion-graphics-animation-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="motion graphics animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double click the image then the Animation tab will display. Here, there are available presets, either the latest or the Legacy Animation, as indicated on the display that you can use.</p>
<p>There is also a tab if you want to customize your animations which requires premium account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fade In</li>
<li>Fade Out</li>
<li>Pause</li>
<li>Slide right</li>
<li>Slide up</li>
<li>Vortex In</li>
<li>Vortex Out</li>

                      alt="customize motion animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Select any animation you want by double-clicking the presets. In this case, I selected a slight right preset, and you will notice that the start arrow and end arrow indicator are displayed.</p>
<p>In the Timeline panel, you have an option to customize the start and end of the Preset. Just drag the arrow keys on either side to reach the keyframe you wish to change. Just simple.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change key frame animation video"
                ></p>
<p>You can also do it on the cloud image that we’ve added.</p>
<h2 id="Takeaway"><a href="#Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Takeaway"></a>Takeaway</h2><p>Keyframing can bring steady images to life by introducing animations. With the super-easy keyframing tool in Filmora, you can now make invigorating videos. From easy to complex key framing. The customization property lets you unbind your creativity and take your editing to a professional level. Make your logo pop by adding keyframe animations. Better yet, you can also animate text.</p>
<p>No matter what industry you’re in, Animation can be relevant. Small start-ups to giant corporations use animation videos, too. Animation videos help to explain tricky processes or concepts, sell a product, or even to gain recognition for a product. Everyone resonates with Animation in some way or another. Almost everyone has watched cartoons or animations in their life, so these tend to grab attention more effectively.</p>
<p>We all love animation. From the animated cartoons we watched as kids to the latest and hottest animated music video, there’s something about seeing visuals come alive that captivates and inspires us. But video animation isn’t just for children, and it isn’t just for the entertainment value only.</p>

<p>Some tips you can keep in mind while creating logo are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be specific to your brand. Be sure that you are not choosing a logo that may deviate customers from your brand perspective.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Always choose colors in contrast because a single color logo does not seem to be appealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure to choose a template that is easy to understand. If the template seems to be difficult to understand, a user will not be able to get it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.</p>

If you haven’t heard about claymations so far, you are not alone. Unfortunately, a wide range of the global population is unfamiliar with the concept of stop motion claymation.</p>

<p>But, if you are someone who wants to get into animation, but don’t have an expensive budget, claymations can be a great tool to share your story with the world and attract a global audience. In this guide, we are going to talk about claymations, some of the most popular claymation websites, and the best ways to get started with <strong>stop motion claymation</strong>. So, if you also want to explore your creative side and be unique with the approach, continue reading. By the end of this guide, you’ll be running out to buy clay and make some high-quality <strong>clay stop-motion animations</strong>.</p>

<p>03 [Best 5 Clay for Stop Motion and Ways to Get Started](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone"><a href="#Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone"></a>Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone</h2><p>So, now that you are familiar with the basic concept of <strong>clay stop animation</strong>, let’s understand how you can get started with claymation animations. Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Edit-a-Stop-Motion-Claymation-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Edit-a-Stop-Motion-Claymation-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation"></a>Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation</h2><p>At this point, you would have several hundred photographs and a script in mind to make your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong>. So, the next part would be to turn these raw images into an animation. To do this, you can use different types of video editing applications. However, we recommend using Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.</p>

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation.

There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

<h3 id="02Van-Aken-3"><a href="#02Van-Aken-3" class="headerlink" title="02Van Aken"></a>02Van Aken</h3><p>Van Aken is another popular clay brand that’s ideal for <strong>claymation animations</strong>.

This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.</p>
