These files use to have small size so they can be transferred and downloaded with ease and at faster rate. If you are interested to know about various resizing concepts related to GIFs then the article below can be helpful for you.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-reduce-GIF-size-2"><a href="#How-to-reduce-GIF-size-2" class="headerlink" title="How to reduce GIF size?"></a>How to reduce GIF size?</h2><p>There are so many things that contribute in managing overall size of GIFs. The list includes the colour count inside, dimensions of images that you have used for development of GIFs and number of frames included inside one GIF folder. In case if it is an animated GIF then size may increase accordingly. Somehow, if you become able to optimize your Gifs then it is much easier to share them over internet.</p>
<p>Photoshop is a great tool to edit your image, including gif images. Here we are going to show you how to make your GIF smaller in Photoshop.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>

<p>The very first task for users is to bring your GIF video file onto Photoshop timeline. Sometimes, it is not essential to update whole series of your GIF animation to the library, the GIF can be simply trimmed at timeline panel. One needs to turn on loop option and then be active enough to allocate the right place to trim your video.</p>
<p> <strong>2. Reduce dimensions of Output:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Those who are working on Photoshop CC 2017 version will be able to develop GIFs by simply executing Explore As option from menu. To do this, they need to move to files and then from drop down menu select Export as. Soon a menu will open where you need to choose your output file format as GIF and adjust weight and height parameter to reduce physical dimensions of your image.</p>
<p>In case if you are using Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 then on its interface, users need to move to File and then hit Save for Web option. It will help to open a Save for Web type dialogue box immediately, on this new window you can apply desired changes to physical dimensions of your content, reduce color information and apply dithering etc.</p>
<p> <strong>3. Adjust number of colors in image:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-number-photoshop.jpg"
                     
                ></p>

<p>One of the most useful tricks for marketers is to optimize size of their GIF images by adjusting total number of colours to it. It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.</p>
<p> <strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can also reduce number of frames in their GIFs.</li>
<li>Never forget to avoid dithering as it may help to improve appearance of images.</li>
<li>It is essential work with loss less compression algorithms otherwise huge loss in information will be carried out.</li>
<li>Interlacing is not good option for your GIFs as it causes significant increase in overall file size.</li>

Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="01Modern-Cartoon-Style-3"><a href="#01Modern-Cartoon-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="01Modern Cartoon Style"></a>01Modern Cartoon Style</h3><p>This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.</p>
<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Dexter’s Laboratory</p>

The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>.</p>

<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>
<p>A few examples of classic manga possessing this <strong>cartoon style drawing</strong> are:</p>
