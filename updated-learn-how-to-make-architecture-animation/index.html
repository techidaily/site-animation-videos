<p><strong>Architecture Animation</strong> is the practice of creating a 3D Animation of a structure. A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.</p>

These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.</p>
<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

However, these days, <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for <strong>Architectural Animations</strong> grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong>.</p>

However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> has only continued to grow over the years, we’ve also included this section on the many benefits of <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors</p>
<h3 id="01Detailed-Construction-Requirements"><a href="#01Detailed-Construction-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="01Detailed Construction Requirements"></a>01<strong>Detailed Construction Requirements</strong></h3><p>As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong>. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Complete-Visual-Touring"><a href="#02Complete-Visual-Touring" class="headerlink" title="02Complete Visual Touring"></a>02<strong>Complete Visual Touring</strong></h3><p>Of course, outside of construction parameters, there’s also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Traditional Architectural Plan"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Scope-and-Scale-of-Project"><a href="#03Scope-and-Scale-of-Project" class="headerlink" title="03Scope and Scale of Project"></a>03<strong>Scope and Scale of Project</strong></h3><p>Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that’s important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there’s any.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="04Architectural-Animations-Easily-Shareable"><a href="#04Architectural-Animations-Easily-Shareable" class="headerlink" title="04Architectural Animations Easily Shareable"></a>04<strong>Architectural Animations Easily Shareable</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this in passing previously, but <strong>architectural animations</strong> are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full</p>
<p>Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished’ property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.</p>

<h3 id="05Customer-Reassurance-Boost"><a href="#05Customer-Reassurance-Boost" class="headerlink" title="05Customer Reassurance Boost"></a>05<strong>Customer Reassurance Boost</strong></h3><p>Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It’s quite relieving, as we’re certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="06Make-Corrections-Early-and-Efficiently"><a href="#06Make-Corrections-Early-and-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="06Make Corrections Early and Efficiently"></a>06<strong>Make Corrections Early and Efficiently</strong></h3><p>Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you’ve got the look right this time around</p>
<p>No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.</p>

<h3 id="07Architectural-Animations-Are-Promotable-Content"><a href="#07Architectural-Animations-Are-Promotable-Content" class="headerlink" title="07Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content"></a>07<strong>Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content</strong></h3><p>So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It’s already there after all, why not use it?</p>

<h3 id="01VisEngine"><a href="#01VisEngine" class="headerlink" title="01VisEngine"></a>01<strong>VisEngine</strong></h3><p>The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is “VisEngine.” They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you’re curious as to the look of their finished <strong>architectural animations</strong>, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out</p>
<h3 id="02Exodo-Animation-Studios"><a href="#02Exodo-Animation-Studios" class="headerlink" title="02Exodo Animation Studios"></a>02<strong>Exodo Animation Studios</strong></h3><p>“Exodo Animation Studios” is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They’ve had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI</p>
<h3 id="03Promoshin"><a href="#03Promoshin" class="headerlink" title="03Promoshin"></a>03<strong>Promoshin</strong></h3><p>Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn’t mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they’ve worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)</p>
<h3 id="04ZOA-Studio"><a href="#04ZOA-Studio" class="headerlink" title="04ZOA Studio"></a>04<strong>ZOA Studio</strong></h3><p>ZOA Studio brings us back to <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it’s a great resource for those looking for inspiration)</p>
<h3 id="05Studio-Aiko"><a href="#05Studio-Aiko" class="headerlink" title="05Studio Aiko"></a>05<strong>Studio Aiko</strong></h3><p>Again, this next studio, called “Studio Aiko” is usually better known for its regular 3D Animation work. However, that doesn’t mean that their <strong>architectural animations</strong> are any lesser in quality They produce very high-quality work fit for any kind of media platform. Making it a fitting solution for many professional architects</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Animations are now a staple for real estate projects. What with architects and construction engineers alike preferring to work with designers who can hand over a detailed look of their vision from the onset.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many other benefits to <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong>, of course, amongst which is better communication between you, as the designer, and your partners and clients <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> breathes life into a vision that may have previously existed only in your mind, and it smooths misunderstandings and eases progress</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking to start a career in <strong>3D Animation Architecture</strong>, we recommend that you look into some of the more popular service providers and studios in your area YouTube is a good platform to start looking if you’re unsure. There, you can find many finished <strong>architectural animations</strong> that can serve as inspiration for future projects</p>

These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.</p>
<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.</p>
<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

However, these days, <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for <strong>Architectural Animations</strong> grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong>.</p>

However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> has only continued to grow over the years, we’ve also included this section on the many benefits of <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors</p>
<h3 id="01Detailed-Construction-Requirements-3"><a href="#01Detailed-Construction-Requirements-3" class="headerlink" title="01Detailed Construction Requirements"></a>01<strong>Detailed Construction Requirements</strong></h3><p>As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong>. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.</p>

<h3 id="02Complete-Visual-Touring-3"><a href="#02Complete-Visual-Touring-3" class="headerlink" title="02Complete Visual Touring"></a>02<strong>Complete Visual Touring</strong></h3><p>Of course, outside of construction parameters, there’s also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.</p>

A <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that’s important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there’s any.)</p>

Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full</p>
<p>Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished’ property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.</p>

<h3 id="05Customer-Reassurance-Boost-3"><a href="#05Customer-Reassurance-Boost-3" class="headerlink" title="05Customer Reassurance Boost"></a>05<strong>Customer Reassurance Boost</strong></h3><p>Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It’s quite relieving, as we’re certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.</p>

If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you’ve got the look right this time around</p>
<p>No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.</p>

<p>In case your selected images do not have a matching aspect ratio with the program’s preset values, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option for removing the additional black bars from the selected images. For the requirement of adding camera pan and zoom movements to your images, select the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option in the ‘Preferences’ settings.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself.

<p>After you are done with applying transitions to each slide, double click on a particular transition to open its ‘Transition Setting Window’ either for presetting the transition play duration or to choose a desired transition mode. You can also prefer a direct customization of the transition duration in the project timeline through a right or left dragging of any of its ends.</p>

                      alt="Wondershare Filmora Animated Slideshow Creator- Media Import Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Timeline Positioning of Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Before working on the task of positioning the imported media files on the app’s timeline, navigate to the ‘File’ menu and choose the ‘Preferences’ option. As soon as the respective window pops up, reach to the ‘Editing’ tab at the top and select ‘Photo Placement’ from the drop down menu that follows.</p>
<p>In case your selected images do not have a matching aspect ratio with the program’s preset values, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option for removing the additional black bars from the selected images. For the requirement of adding camera pan and zoom movements to your images, select the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option in the ‘Preferences’ settings.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself. As an alternative you can adhere to the same task in the program’s timeline by dragging any one end of the media files in an outward or inward direction. The ‘Crop to Fit’ option may not give an affordable size in some cases where the images are set in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio. Choose the ‘Fit’ option to set this issue straight.</p>

Proceed with selecting a file and dragging and dropping the same at the desired position within the timeline. Continue repeating the process till all the images have been placed at their respective locations, and in the exact order of appearance in the slideshow. This should be followed by adjusting the image play durations using any one of the previously described methods.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Escape Hard Cuts With Image Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Hard cuts among different slides of a presentation break the flow of the slideshow. To escape this cringe, consider using a smooth transition effect within the slides of your project. To do this, navigate to the ‘Transitions’ tab in the top toolbar of Filmora’s project window and select a desired one from over 100 choices of customizable transitions.</p>
<p>You can now drop these transitions in the timeline at the exact intersection point of two image files. Avoid using the same transition for every hard cut to escape monotony. You can instead choose different transitions for each slide while observing its appearance in the clip.</p>
<p>After you are done with applying transitions to each slide, double click on a particular transition to open its ‘Transition Setting Window’ either for presetting the transition play duration or to choose a desired transition mode. You can also prefer a direct customization of the transition duration in the project timeline through a right or left dragging of any of its ends.</p>

<p>To apply these effects, just select and add them into a timeline track above the clip you wish to add the overlay or filter to. When you have applied the effects, observe the overall clip appearance in the ‘Preview Panel’. Double click on a particular effect to fine-tune the latter’s settings.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Supplement Your Slides With Motion Graphic Elements</strong></p>
<p>While motion graphics will undoubtedly enhance your animated slideshows, adding them to your presentation is purely optional, since most professional projects do not need a motion graphic element to escalate their presentation outlook. If, however, you choose to work on making these a part of your animated slideshow, Filmora lets you do that in its ‘Elements’ tab.</p>
<p>There is a plethora of motion graphic templates that you can select and add to the project timeline for a quick and vibrant upgrade of your presentation slides, but, at the same time, it becomes important to take care of the visual outlook and the underlying reason of creating the slideshow before you decide on adding these elements to your project.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Create Voiceovers and Record Soundtracks for Your Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>Narration is a smart way to captivate the target audience within your slideshow, whether though a self-delivery or a recorded voiceover. If you decide on the second option, you can conveniently use the Filmora Slideshow Creator program to add voiceovers and soundtracks to your presentation.</p>

Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="01Modern-Cartoon-Style-3"><a href="#01Modern-Cartoon-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="01Modern Cartoon Style"></a>01Modern Cartoon Style</h3><p>This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.</p>
<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Dexter’s Laboratory</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Codename: Kids Next Door</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Gravity Falls</p>
<h3 id="02Realistic-Cartoon-Style-3"><a href="#02Realistic-Cartoon-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="02Realistic Cartoon Style"></a>02Realistic Cartoon Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>
<p>Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ugly Americans</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> General Caricataures</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Archer</p>
<h3 id="03Modern-Anime-3"><a href="#03Modern-Anime-3" class="headerlink" title="03Modern Anime"></a>03Modern Anime</h3><p>This style tends to be more complex, primarily seen in drawings where the characters seem to be in motion, like in comic books. Modern-day drawings of this style have a lot of shadows and highlights in their character and environment, giving them a relatively new level of complexity.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> My Hero Academia</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sword Art Online</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Attack on Titan</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</p>
<h3 id="04Classic-Manga-3"><a href="#04Classic-Manga-3" class="headerlink" title="04Classic Manga"></a>04Classic Manga</h3><p>The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.</p>
<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>
<p>A few examples of classic manga possessing this <strong>cartoon style drawing</strong> are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Oh My Goddess</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Urusei Yatsura</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sailor Moon</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Hellsing</p>

<p>Examples of where this drawing style is used:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lucky Star</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bottle Fairy</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Himouto! Umaru-chan</p>
