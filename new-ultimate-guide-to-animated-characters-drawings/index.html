<p>Although, on MotionLeap, without the pro version, the photo will be saved in video format.</p>

<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>

<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work-2"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work-2" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>

<p>Another favored animation teaching prop is the Juice Box. It follows similar principals like the Flour Sack but the straw adds a different dimension to it. This is where an animator can try out more ways to get creative without a simple straw getting in their way.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>The Walking Egg</strong></p>

<p>An egg shaped mechanical quadruped robot who has the ability to contract its legs into its body. Its legs are probably its best feature since it is lockable at then joints. A fun part of this robot is that its screen eyes can turn into guns.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Cartoon Chameleon</strong></p>
<p><img

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Judy Hopps</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="robotor"
                ></p>
<p>Interested in Robots? Try playing with this humanoid figure but be warned that it might not feel as easy to replicate natural human body motion.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bony and Beefy</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-11"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-11" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Rigging is a fantastic way to learn the foundations of animations and how it all ties into the final result. It involves creating skeletal animations of bones that share parental relationship with each other; one bone moves an entire set. You can record these movements and then play them over timeline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can practice rigging with both simple and advanced animations. Complex rigging structures like facial features may require separate project of its own. There are various rigging software like Blender and Maya which provides you with everything you need to carry out a successful rigging process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get started with rigging animation by practicing on free Maya Rigs. Find out which rig suits you best according to your skills level.</p>
