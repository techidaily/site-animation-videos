<p>Marketers and content creators can take full advantage of online apps to develop amazing animated videos that would instantly grasp the viewer’s attention. Here are three secrets you should know about creating an amazing animated video:</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

<p>Marketers and content creators can take full advantage of online apps to develop amazing animated videos that would instantly grasp the viewer’s attention. Here are three secrets you should know about creating an amazing animated video:</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

                      alt="Simplify the Complex"
                ></p>

<p>Marketers and content creators can take full advantage of online apps to develop amazing animated videos that would instantly grasp the viewer’s attention. Here are three secrets you should know about creating an amazing animated video:</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

<p>Marketers and content creators can take full advantage of online apps to develop amazing animated videos that would instantly grasp the viewer’s attention. Here are three secrets you should know about creating an amazing animated video:</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

<p>Let me ask you a question - how much fun would it be if you could create your own animated stickers and send them to your friends and family members on Whatsapp? I mean, it would make the entire conversation more fun and also add a personal element to the entire chat. Right? Well, to tell you the truth, it is possible to create <strong>Whatsapp cartoons</strong> and stickers, and the best part is you don’t need any technical expertise to get the job done.</p>
<p>Of course, for a long time, Whatsapp didn’t allow its users to use third-party animated stickers within the messenger. But, recently the messaging platform introduced a custom “stickers pack” feature that now allows people to upload their own stickers and create a dedicated sticker app.</p>
<p>You can also rely on several third-party sticker designer applications to get the job done. So, if you have been looking for a way to use your own face as an animated sticker in Whatsapp, continue reading. In this guide, we’ll walk you through different ways to create and upload a custom cartoon sticker in Whatsapp and make your Whatsapp chats more fun.</p>

There’s no AR feature that’ll turn your face into a cartoon character. So, to use a <strong>cartoon Whatsapp profile picture</strong>, you’ll have to rely on a third-party tool to get the job done. Based on which platform you use to access Whatsapp, you can choose a wide variety of Whatsapp animated sticker creators and use them to design custom cartoon stickers to make traditional Whatsapp conversations more fun.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-6"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-6" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and <strong>animation cartoons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Before you start learning 3d animation and create <strong>cartoon photos,</strong> ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-20"><a href="#In-this-article-20" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [All You Need to Know About 2D Rigging](#Part 1)</p>

<p>03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 All You Need to Know About Rigging"></a>Part 1 <strong>All You Need to Know About Rigging</strong></h2><p>For this first part, we’re going to talk about <strong>Rigging</strong> in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

<h3 id="03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software"><a href="#03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="03What is Animation Rigging Software?"></a>03<strong>What is Animation Rigging Software?</strong></h3><p>Now, for the last section of this <strong>Rigging</strong> overview, let’s talk about <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

<h3 id="02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations"><a href="#02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Time Investments for Creating and Animations"></a>02<strong>Time Investments for Creating and Animations</strong></h3><p>Next, let’s talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker"><a href="#05Animaker" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro"><a href="#06Moho-Pro" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D"><a href="#07Pencil-2D" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz"><a href="#08OpenToonz" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-1"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-1"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-1" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created.

You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-2"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-2" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-2"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-2" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom-2"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom-2" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio-2"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate-2"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate-2" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker-2"><a href="#05Animaker-2" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro-2"><a href="#06Moho-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D-2"><a href="#07Pencil-2D-2" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz-2"><a href="#08OpenToonz-2" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-2"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-2" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-3"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation-3"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>
