<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?</h2><p><strong>2D animation</strong> is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life"><a href="#02Observe-real-life" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?</h2><p><strong>2D animation</strong> is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life-1"><a href="#02Observe-real-life-1" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key-1"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key-1" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important-1"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important-1" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-1"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-1"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-3"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time to move on with thinking about which cartoon characters to put in your papers with emotions, facial expressions and other features. We are now moving towards the process to include more and more emotions to the same.</p>
<p>Let’s begin drawing 8 amazing characters that are not only famous but also living in heart of children.</p>
<h3 id="01Bugs-Bunny"><a href="#01Bugs-Bunny" class="headerlink" title="01Bugs Bunny"></a>01Bugs Bunny</h3><p>Who doesn’t live Bugs Bunny? Well, it is among the list of most iconic characters that you can imagine and it is certainly the most funnies and interesting character to draw. Right from drawing its big feet to attractive teeth just made for cutting carrots, a lot of things are included in Bugs bunny.</p>
<p>Let’s Draw it:-</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw a circle &amp; a “noodle” shaped object as per the imagination. The circle will be its head &amp; pear shape will be its body. You need to make bottom pear fatter as compared to upper portion and also upper-part has to overlap head circle only a little.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Include perspective guidelines at around the head as this thing can correctly position eyes as well as nose of your bunny.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You need to draw the eyes at Horizontal guideline and nose where guidelines crosses.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw cheeks and include ears, arms. At the time of drawing arms, you have to give natural curve to arms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The arm curves together with the legs-curves might look little difficult, therefore you have to make use of your pencil tenderly without pushing it harder.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Draw inner lines in ear &amp; iris ellipse at inner portion of eyes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add nose &amp; draw mouth, teeth.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your Bunny starts taking its shape and here you can add colors as per your choice</p>

<p>Work on the head first with nice &amp; precise circle in order to illustrate head portion. Inside this, you can add two more tiny circles for eyes. Once you are done with the eyes, you need to add large &amp; thin rectangle that represents headband. At one portion of headband draw tiny circle with small triangles in numbers 2.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p>Left arm of our ninja can be sketched through a long &amp; thin rectangle. In order to showcase right arm, draw two rectangles and later on both hands has to be represented in terms of circles.</p>

<h2 id="Why-use-animation-for-business-3"><a href="#Why-use-animation-for-business-3" class="headerlink" title="Why use animation for business?"></a>Why use animation for business?</h2><p>As we have earlier mentioned, animation is the key to attractive branding. According to Smart Insights’ recent article on Video Marketing in 2020, around 92% of marketers feel this an essential part of business strategy. In contrast, 88% of marketers think that video marketing in animation offers them positive ROI.</p>
<p>We can describe to you a list of 5 reasons to use animation for business as follows.</p>
<h4 id="It-is-fun-and-entertaining-3"><a href="#It-is-fun-and-entertaining-3" class="headerlink" title="It is fun and entertaining"></a>It is fun and entertaining</h4><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be realistic or accurate. The purpose of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill fun and entertainment. The animation is a way to grab customers’ attention rather than being used as a strict marketing tool. Customers will look over to the story more interesting than the traditional ad system.</p>
<h4 id="Lasting-impression-3"><a href="#Lasting-impression-3" class="headerlink" title="Lasting impression"></a>Lasting impression</h4><p>The animated videos for business leave a memorable impression on the current as well as new customers. However, you must be clear about using animation in a way that creatively tells about your business. A story that is too different from the business purpose may not be a good idea to create a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, you must tell about the values you inject in a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the visuals and the information they get from it.</p>
<h4 id="Boosts-conversion-rate-3"><a href="#Boosts-conversion-rate-3" class="headerlink" title="Boosts conversion rate"></a>Boosts conversion rate</h4><p>Due to the highly attractive nature of business animation videos, the customer is likely to complete the action as expected by the brand. More than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content rather than getting you the high bounce off rates. So, you should beautifully explain the merits of your service or product to the user in animated videos for business. It’s great if you add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h4 id="Easy-updates-3"><a href="#Easy-updates-3" class="headerlink" title="Easy updates"></a>Easy updates</h4><p>Being a potent marketing tool animation for business is a new and updated aspect. It is one of the advanced digital technologies to update messaging and marketing collateral and reflect your business values. The presentation of content with animation appeals to different and new potential audiences cost-effectively and efficiently.</p>
<h4 id="Turns-complex-ideas-into-easy-ones-3"><a href="#Turns-complex-ideas-into-easy-ones-3" class="headerlink" title="Turns complex ideas into easy ones"></a>Turns complex ideas into easy ones</h4><p>Dealing with complex ideas or products in the text form can be pretty hard to convey effectively unless you insert animation in the text and make it attractive. After all, complex ideas can’t quickly turn into easy ones.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-choose-animation-styles-for-your-business-3"><a href="#How-to-choose-animation-styles-for-your-business-3" class="headerlink" title="How to choose animation styles for your business?"></a>How to choose animation styles for your business?</h2><p>After knowing the apparent benefits of animation, we will discuss how you can choose different animation styles for your business. There could be lots of types, among which we are just going to mention four basic animation styles for business.</p>
<h4 id="Kinetic-Typography-3"><a href="#Kinetic-Typography-3" class="headerlink" title="Kinetic Typography"></a>Kinetic Typography</h4><p><img

                      alt="kinetic typography"
                ></p>
<p>Kinetic typography means ‘moving text.’ You can see this kind of animation everywhere, from website landing pages to TV commercials. The tool can be useful to shrink, expand, fly, grow, move in slow motion, or change the letter in numerous ways to grab readers’ attention.</p>
<h4 id="Character-animation-3"><a href="#Character-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Character animation"></a>Character animation</h4><p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/character-animation.jpg"
                      alt="character animation"
                ></p>
<p>Character animation refers to making animated animals or persons. It depends solely on the animator’s animator or demand to create a character and decide how it will move, look, or interact with the external environment.</p>
<h4 id="Whiteboard-animation-3"><a href="#Whiteboard-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Whiteboard animation"></a>Whiteboard animation</h4><p>The whiteboard animation is another famous kind of animation for business where a storyboard is the basics. The process tells you a story mostly by the presentation of someone’s hands. Notably, the whiteboard is to represent the time-lapse or stop motion effect.</p>
<h4 id="Infographics-3"><a href="#Infographics-3" class="headerlink" title="Infographics"></a>Infographics</h4><p><img

                      alt="infographic for business"
                ></p>
<p>Information Graphics or Infographics refers to the visual representation of data or information. Generally, it collects charts, imagery, and minimal text to give a simple overview of the topic. The animated videos for business with Infographics are one of the valuable tools for business communication.</p>
<h2 id="What-to-Consider-before-Making-Animated-Business-Videos-3"><a href="#What-to-Consider-before-Making-Animated-Business-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider before Making Animated Business Videos?"></a>What to Consider before Making Animated Business Videos?</h2><p>The decision to make animated videos for business could be a tricky task even if you are aware of the importance, as mentioned above, of animation. Merely knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You need to implement the right strategies and know what factors are essential to look for before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those critical points!</p>
<h4 id="Budget-3"><a href="#Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="Budget"></a>Budget</h4><p>The budget comes as the top-most factor because you can’t do anything without enough money. So, be ready to invest a fair amount or at least invest in reliable video editing software. However, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, using Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $49.99 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. However, it also depends upon the kind of job and style of business values you want to present in the animation. You have to outsource if it’s expert-level work!</p>
<h4 id="Brand-Positioning-3"><a href="#Brand-Positioning-3" class="headerlink" title="Brand Positioning"></a>Brand Positioning</h4><p>Consider your brand positioning! While using the animation for business, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values than mere visuals. They want to know your identity as a brand and your industry.

It offers a full-scale editing panel and a plethora of features that allow designers to create visually enticing 3D animations for videos, games, and marketing purposes. But, can you use Blender to create 2D animations? Even though the tool is marketed as a 3D animation creator, it’s worth noting that one can use it for 2D animations as well. Now, the process may not be as straightforward as using a dedicated 2D animation creator, you can still get the job done using Blender. This will be pretty helpful if you are already a Blender user and want to create 2D animations for a project.</p>
<p>To help you along the way, we have put together a detailed guide on how to create Blender 2D animations and use them in your videos to make them look more stunning. So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.</p>

                      alt="design image blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.</p>
<h5 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5"><a href="#Step-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 5"></a>Step 5</h5><p>Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you’ve drawn on the screen and then, select “Rotation and Scale”.

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blender-2D-Animation-As-Awesome-AS-3D-3"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blender-2D-Animation-As-Awesome-AS-3D-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blender 2D Animation As Awesome AS 3D?"></a>Part 1 Is Blender 2D Animation As Awesome AS 3D?</h2><p>There’s no arguing the fact that Blender is a remarkable tool for 3D animations. Its worldwide popularity is clear proof of what one can achieve while creating a 3D animation with Blender. But, the real question is - are Blender 2D animations as good as their 3D alternatives. Well, the answer is Yes! Blender has a built-in feature known as Grease Pencil that’s specifically designed to create 2D animations. With Grease Pencil, you can create different 2D layouts from scratch and turn them into visually appealing animations to engage the potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?"></a>Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?</h2><p>So, how can you create 2D animations in Blender? Well, it depends! The process to create a 2D animation in Blender mainly depends on what you want to design. You can find different Blender 2D animation tutorials on YouTube and use them to get started with 2D animations in Blender. But, we would like to point out that there’s a generic process that’ll remain consistent in every situation. If you are also getting started with creating 2D animations in Blender, here’s the step-by-step process that’ll help you start sailing in the right direction and make the 2D animation designing a hassle-free task.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-3"><a href="#Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>First and foremost, launch Blender on your system and set it up to get started. On the home screen, click on “File&gt;New” and then, select “2D Animation”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-1.jpg"
                      alt="file new blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-2.jpg"
                      alt="design image blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.</p>
<h5 id="Step-4-3"><a href="#Step-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="array modifier blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5-3"><a href="#Step-5-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5"></a>Step 5</h5><p>Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you’ve drawn on the screen and then, select “Rotation and Scale”. A separate editing window will pop up on your screen. Here you can customize the movement of the object by changing its scaling options through keyframing.</p>
<p>That’s it; your 2D animation is now ready and you can save it on your computer.</p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Display-Pinterest-Latest-Pins-in-A-Slideshow"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Display-Pinterest-Latest-Pins-in-A-Slideshow" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow</strong></h2><p>Using Pinterest’s latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger’s blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Construct Pinterest Feed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>
<p>Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Layout and click on ‘Add A Gadget.’</p>
<p>Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.</p>

                      alt="Add the Slideshow Widget 2"
                ></p>
<p>Put in the converted Pinterest RSS feed URL from step 2 into the Feed URL text box.</p>
<p>Click Save and view your blog.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-Multiple-Photos-to-Pinterest"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-Multiple-Photos-to-Pinterest" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest"></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest</strong></h2><p>If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.</p>
<p>When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during <strong>the Pinterest slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Log into your Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see ‘convert to business,’ then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either ‘png’ or ‘jpeg.’</p>
<p>Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-4.jpg"
                      alt="Log into your Pinterest"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Title</strong></p>
<p>Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe’s title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select a Board</strong></p>
<p>The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Pinterest-Slideshow-In-5-Simple-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Pinterest-Slideshow-In-5-Simple-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Make Pinterest Slideshow In 5 Simple Ways"></a>Part 3 <strong>How to Make Pinterest Slideshow In 5 Simple Ways</strong></h2><p>Slideshows are a beautiful way to enhance your Pinterest account and generate more leads on your Profile.

                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4: Select Boards</strong></p>
<p>After clicking Edit for your Featured Boards, you’ll reach a screen where you may edit the boards you want to highlight. Select which boards you’d like to feature by clicking on each drop-down menu.</p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>
<p>Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Layout and click on ‘Add A Gadget.’</p>
<p>Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.</p>

Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.</p>
<p>When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during <strong>the Pinterest slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Log into your Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see ‘convert to business,’ then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either ‘png’ or ‘jpeg.’</p>
<p>Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Title</strong></p>
<p>Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe’s title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select a Board</strong></p>
<p>The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.</p>

<p>Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.</p>
<p>Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the <strong>Pinterest slideshow</strong>, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.</p>

Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.</p>
<p>To install this widget, you need the user or board’s RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.</p>
<p>Here are the tricky steps to follow for <strong>the Pinterest slide show</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL</strong></p>
<p>The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be the user’s profile URL + feed&#x2F;RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser’s URL. That is your profile URL.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser’s URL bar.</p>

                      alt="Construct Pinterest Feed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:</strong></p>
<p>The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.</p>
<p>You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.</p>
<p>With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add the slideshow widget</strong></p>
<p>Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.</p>
<p>Go to Dashboard &gt; Layout and click on ‘Add A Gadget.’</p>
<p>Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Put in the converted Pinterest RSS feed URL from step 2 into the Feed URL text box.</p>
<p>Click Save and view your blog.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Upload-Multiple-Photos-to-Pinterest-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Upload-Multiple-Photos-to-Pinterest-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest"></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest</strong></h2><p>If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.</p>
<p>When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during <strong>the Pinterest slideshow</strong>.</p>
<p>This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Log into your Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see ‘convert to business,’ then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either ‘png’ or ‘jpeg.’</p>
<p>Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Log into your Pinterest"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Title</strong></p>
<p>Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe’s title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select a Board</strong></p>
<p>The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.</p>

But then <strong>Pinterest slideshows</strong> are instead referred to as a showcase.</p>
<p>However, to access this feature, you must first own a business account on Pinterest.</p>
<p>Here are five (5) simple ways you can make <strong>Slideshow on Pinterest</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Go to your Pinterest Profile</strong></p>
<p>Click settings next to your profile photo in the top right corner.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Click Edit"
                ></p>
<p> <strong>Step 4: Select Boards</strong></p>
<p>After clicking Edit for your Featured Boards, you’ll reach a screen where you may edit the boards you want to highlight. Select which boards you’d like to feature by clicking on each drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Opening a new Pinterest page is a good idea. Scroll down to Boards with the most Pin impressions under Analytics&gt;Profile. These are the boards that I highlighted.</p>

<p>There has been an advancement in the cartoon since the last publication made by “Paste” (a 5,800-word short story by Henry James). However, traditional cable networks have created exciting and new worlds and characters. Various streaming platforms like YouTube have allowed different creators to <strong>draw cartoon videos</strong> and publish them as they want. It has long been said that cartoons are specifically made for kids to enjoy on Saturday morning, but this is no longer the case as adults now enjoy watching cartoons in their free time.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

<h3 id="01Futurama"><a href="#01Futurama" class="headerlink" title="01Futurama"></a>01Futurama</h3><p>This <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that’s pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.</p>

This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor’s non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz’s Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.</p>

However, you might not like the Griffin family or the other residents of Quahog, but you have to admit that the show stumbles on a great joke.</p>

<p>There has been an advancement in the cartoon since the last publication made by “Paste” (a 5,800-word short story by Henry James). However, traditional cable networks have created exciting and new worlds and characters. Various streaming platforms like YouTube have allowed different creators to <strong>draw cartoon videos</strong> and publish them as they want. It has long been said that cartoons are specifically made for kids to enjoy on Saturday morning, but this is no longer the case as adults now enjoy watching cartoons in their free time.</p>

The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a “golden age.”</p>
<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.</p>
<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>

<h3 id="01Futurama-1"><a href="#01Futurama-1" class="headerlink" title="01Futurama"></a>01Futurama</h3><p>This <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that’s pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.</p>

This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor’s non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz’s Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.</p>

However, four (4) days later, the series was renewed for a second season, released on July 17, 2015.

<p>The <strong>popular cartoon</strong> series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie.

<p>However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.</p>
<p>Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.</p>
