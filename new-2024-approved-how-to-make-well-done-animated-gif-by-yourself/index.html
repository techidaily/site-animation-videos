                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-3.gif"
                      alt="mr porter"
                ></p>
<p>This is an animated fireplace in the email marketing newsletter of Mr. Porter. It gives a pretty cozy and warm feel and atmosphere to the entire image, which is what they’re looking for or wandering for with the casual clothes the man is wearing.</p>
<h3 id="3-American-Apparel"><a href="#3-American-Apparel" class="headerlink" title="3. American Apparel"></a>3. American Apparel</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-1.gif"
                      alt="american apparel"
                ></p>
<p>American Apparel sells “power washed” T-shirts to make them “super soft.”</p>
<p>This critical merit would not attract many users if it weren’t for simulating the animated GIF of the T-shirts getting washed in an imaginary washing machine.</p>
<h3 id="4-Looper"><a href="#4-Looper" class="headerlink" title="4. Looper"></a>4. Looper</h3><p><img

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

How To Set A GIF Loop Count?</h4><p>Nearly all GIF editors allow you to specify how many loops a GIF is going to make before it comes to a stop. All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-To-Set-A-GIF-Loop-Count-3"><a href="#2-How-To-Set-A-GIF-Loop-Count-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How To Set A GIF Loop Count?"></a>2. How To Set A GIF Loop Count?</h4><p>Nearly all GIF editors allow you to specify how many loops a GIF is going to make before it comes to a stop. All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>
