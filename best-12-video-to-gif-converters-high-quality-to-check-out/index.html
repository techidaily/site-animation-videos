For the requirement of adding camera pan and zoom movements to your images, select the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option in the ‘Preferences’ settings.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself.

<h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>After reading this guide, I’m sure that you can easily pick or create all kinds of good night&#x2F;morning GIFs. While Photoshop can make animated good morning&#x2F;night GIFs, it is certainly not that user-friendly. That’s why I would recommend using a reliable and friendly application like Wondershare Filmora to meet your requirements. The media-editing tool has an extensive range of assets and offers tons of high-end features to come up with all sorts of inspiring, romantic, or funny good morning&#x2F;night GIFs.</p>
