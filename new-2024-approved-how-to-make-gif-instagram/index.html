Traditional animation"></a>1. Traditional animation</h4><p>As you would expect, this type of animation is the kind of old classic animation drawn on paper. The characters, backgrounds and layout were normally committed to paper by hand, with each drawing being slightly different from its predecessor.

<p>Synfig Studio is a popular product for those wishing to produce videos that are traditional in look and feel. It supports a variety of layers and offers a bone system as well as sound support.</p>
<h4 id="2-2D-animation-2"><a href="#2-2D-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="2. 2D animation"></a>2. 2D animation</h4><p>With 2D animation, movement is created in a two-dimensional environment.

The main three processes of 3D are modeling, layout and animation plus rendering. There are many reliable solutions for 3D animation on the market, with Autodesk 3DS Max being a market leader.</p>
<p>This product offers simple, robust modeling, allowing you to create a wide range of environments with richly-detailed characters and enjoy high-end rendering. It is used for producing games, product design, architecture and more.</p>
<h4 id="4-Clay-animation-2"><a href="#4-Clay-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Clay animation"></a>4. Clay animation</h4><p>Clay animation is also called claymation and has been around for many years. In clay animation, clay pieces are used to create characters and background animation. The pieces are moved or deformed between frames so continuous motion can occur.</p>
<p>One leading solution for clay animation is Adobe Animate CC. With this product, you can create vector animations for apps, games, videos and more. You can publish the results quickly and can animate pretty much anything, allowing your characters to walk, talk, blink and more with ease.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to create illusions of depths via the enhanced camera tool, and new features are being added all the time.</p>

<p>HTML5 Maker is a free solution ideal for beginners and pros that supports various leading text filters and offers a diverse library of images. You can use this tool to produce elegant animations with stunning transitions and create gorgeous Instagram-esque effects.</p>

Kinetic Typography Animation</h4><p>Typography animation as another type of animation enables you to do all sorts of exciting and thought-provoking things with letters and fonts. Kinetic typography is based on the concept of moving text and is often used for advertising purposes and to deliver important information including statistics and more.</p>
<p>Videos involving kinetic typography animation can help you demand the attention of your audience. One very popular tool for creating kinetic typography animation is Renderforest.</p>
<p>This solution is ideal even for those without vast technical expertise and helps you create animations, music visualizations, slideshows and much more in mere moments. Trailers, YouTube openings, logo animations are frequently created with the tool, as are explainer animations and whiteboard videos, to give you just a few more examples.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-6"><a href="#Conclusion-6" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Once you have found the types of animated videos and tools that appeal to you the most and have created your content, you can put magical finishing touches to your videos by using Filmora.</p>
