This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>
<h3 id="01Aurora-3D-Text-Logo-Maker"><a href="#01Aurora-3D-Text-Logo-Maker" class="headerlink" title="01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker"></a>01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> FREE!</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<h3 id="02Animaker"><a href="#02Animaker" class="headerlink" title="02Animaker"></a>02Animaker</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> Basic Plan &#x3D; $10 per month!</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<h3 id="03OpenToonz"><a href="#03OpenToonz" class="headerlink" title="03OpenToonz"></a>03OpenToonz</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<h3 id="04Reallusion"><a href="#04Reallusion" class="headerlink" title="04Reallusion"></a>04Reallusion</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<h3 id="05Express-Animate"><a href="#05Express-Animate" class="headerlink" title="05Express Animate"></a>05Express Animate</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $60 (full license)</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="06Motion"><a href="#06Motion" class="headerlink" title="06Motion"></a>06Motion</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $47</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software.

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool.

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too!

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily.

This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>
<h3 id="01Aurora-3D-Text-Logo-Maker-3"><a href="#01Aurora-3D-Text-Logo-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker"></a>01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> FREE!</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<h3 id="05Express-Animate-3"><a href="#05Express-Animate-3" class="headerlink" title="05Express Animate"></a>05Express Animate</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $60 (full license)</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you’ll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.</p>

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

It offers a full-scale editing panel and a plethora of features that allow designers to create visually enticing 3D animations for videos, games, and marketing purposes. But, can you use Blender to create 2D animations? Even though the tool is marketed as a 3D animation creator, it’s worth noting that one can use it for 2D animations as well. Now, the process may not be as straightforward as using a dedicated 2D animation creator, you can still get the job done using Blender. This will be pretty helpful if you are already a Blender user and want to create 2D animations for a project.</p>
<p>To help you along the way, we have put together a detailed guide on how to create Blender 2D animations and use them in your videos to make them look more stunning. So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blender-2D-Animation-As-Awesome-AS-3D"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blender-2D-Animation-As-Awesome-AS-3D" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blender 2D Animation As Awesome AS 3D?"></a>Part 1 Is Blender 2D Animation As Awesome AS 3D?</h2><p>There’s no arguing the fact that Blender is a remarkable tool for 3D animations. Its worldwide popularity is clear proof of what one can achieve while creating a 3D animation with Blender. But, the real question is - are Blender 2D animations as good as their 3D alternatives. Well, the answer is Yes! Blender has a built-in feature known as Grease Pencil that’s specifically designed to create 2D animations. With Grease Pencil, you can create different 2D layouts from scratch and turn them into visually appealing animations to engage the potential viewers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Mix-2D-3D-Animation-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?"></a>Part 2 How to Mix 2D &amp; 3D Animation in Blender?</h2><p>So, how can you create 2D animations in Blender? Well, it depends! The process to create a 2D animation in Blender mainly depends on what you want to design. You can find different Blender 2D animation tutorials on YouTube and use them to get started with 2D animations in Blender. But, we would like to point out that there’s a generic process that’ll remain consistent in every situation. If you are also getting started with creating 2D animations in Blender, here’s the step-by-step process that’ll help you start sailing in the right direction and make the 2D animation designing a hassle-free task.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>First and foremost, launch Blender on your system and set it up to get started. On the home screen, click on “File&gt;New” and then, select “2D Animation”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-1.jpg"
                      alt="file new blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-2.jpg"
                      alt="design image blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.</p>
<h5 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="array modifier blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5"><a href="#Step-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 5"></a>Step 5</h5><p>Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you’ve drawn on the screen and then, select “Rotation and Scale”. A separate editing window will pop up on your screen. Here you can customize the movement of the object by changing its scaling options through keyframing.</p>
<p>That’s it; your 2D animation is now ready and you can save it on your computer.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Amazing-Blender-2D-Animation-Tutorials"><a href="#Part-3-5-Amazing-Blender-2D-Animation-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Amazing Blender 2D Animation Tutorials"></a>Part 3 5 Amazing Blender 2D Animation Tutorials</h2><p>So, now that you know how to create Blender 2D animations, let’s take a look at a few of the 2D animation tutorials that’ll help you get started with your first animation.

Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>

Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>
