You can find thousands of GIFs shared by users from all across the world. The GIFs are neatly sorted into categories so that you can find your favorite ones easily.</p>
<p>Gfycat was the pioneer in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video to GIF conversion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It first offered the service in 2013 that took the internet by storm. Since then, Gfycat has been the choice of millions of people for sharing memes and short videos.</p>
<p>Gfycat now enables you to share GIFs with sound. You can upload any video and convert it to a GIF without sacrificing the sound. However, you can only upload only up to a minute of GIF that contains sound.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to create your GIF with sound-</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the Gfycat website and choose the video you want to convert. You can add files from your device or use URLs of video sites. Be sure to choose small file sizes for the best results.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt=" Create GIF with Sound in Gfycat"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>You can now trim your video down to your desired length. Remember that adding sound will make the file size big. So, it pays to keep your GIFs short to 60 seconds. Use the sliders to select the portion of the video you want to convert and then click Continue.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" Create GIF with Sound in Gfycat - trim"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Besides sound, Gfycat also lets you add texts and captions to your GIFs. You can move the slider to the proper time and then click ADD A CAPTION to add a new text box. If you don’t need to add text, click Continue and jump to the next step.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Now comes the time to add titles and tags to your GIFs. To create and share the GIF with sound, remember to enable the Speaker icon. After you’re done, just click the FINISH button to upload your GIF with sound on Gfycat.</li>
