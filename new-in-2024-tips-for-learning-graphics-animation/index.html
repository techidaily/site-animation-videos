<p>In the recent few years, videos have become the primary tool for marketers to attract their target customers. Unlike banners and pamphlets, videos are relatively more engaging and make it easier for marketers to establish a connection with the viewers. Now, each brand has different preferences when it comes to choosing the right video marketing strategy.</p>
<p>While some brands opt for conventional video advertisements, others get a bit creative and introduce <strong>graphics animation</strong> to their videos to make them more captivating. Of course, if you want to maximize the user’s attention and retain more customers, you would prefer the latter. Animated videos are more engaging and also sets the brand apart from the rest of the crowd.</p>

The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.</p>
<p>However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why <strong>graphics and animations</strong> should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.</p>
<p>Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Motion-Graphics-and-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Motion-Graphics-and-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What’s the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?"></a>Part 2 What’s the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?</h2><p>Now, whenever we talk about <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.</p>
<h3 id="01Motion-Graphics"><a href="#01Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="01Motion Graphics"></a>01Motion Graphics</h3><p><img

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.</p>
<h3 id="02Animations"><a href="#02Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02Animations</h3><p>Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of <strong>graphics animations.</strong> However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text&#x2F;objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.</p>
<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Graphic-Design-Techniques-for-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#Part-3-5-Graphic-Design-Techniques-for-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics"></a>Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics</h2><p>So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="01Start-With-a-Template"><a href="#01Start-With-a-Template" class="headerlink" title="01Start With a Template"></a>01Start With a Template</h3><p>Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.</p>
<p>Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.</p>

<h3 id="02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding"><a href="#02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding" class="headerlink" title="02Be Subtle With Personal Branding"></a>02Be Subtle With Personal Branding</h3><p>Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your <strong>motion graphics animation.</strong></p>

<h3 id="03Do-Not-Add-Unnecessary-Elements"><a href="#03Do-Not-Add-Unnecessary-Elements" class="headerlink" title="03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements"></a>03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements</h3><p>It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.</p>

<h3 id="04Design-Multiple-Variations"><a href="#04Design-Multiple-Variations" class="headerlink" title="04Design Multiple Variations"></a>04Design Multiple Variations</h3><p>It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A&#x2F;B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.</p>
<h3 id="05Use-GIF-Format"><a href="#05Use-GIF-Format" class="headerlink" title="05Use GIF Format"></a>05Use GIF Format</h3><p>Finally, once your <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.</p>

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively.

In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.</p>

<p>Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.</p>
<p>Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.</p>
<h3 id="02Animations-3"><a href="#02Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="02Animations"></a>02Animations</h3><p>Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of <strong>graphics animations.</strong> However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text&#x2F;objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.</p>
<p>The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Graphic-Design-Techniques-for-Motion-Graphics-3"><a href="#Part-3-5-Graphic-Design-Techniques-for-Motion-Graphics-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics"></a>Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics</h2><p>So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with <strong>graphic animation videos</strong>. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="01Start-With-a-Template-3"><a href="#01Start-With-a-Template-3" class="headerlink" title="01Start With a Template"></a>01Start With a Template</h3><p>Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.</p>
<p>Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.</p>

<h3 id="02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding-3"><a href="#02Be-Subtle-With-Personal-Branding-3" class="headerlink" title="02Be Subtle With Personal Branding"></a>02Be Subtle With Personal Branding</h3><p>Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your <strong>motion graphics animation.</strong></p>

<h3 id="04Design-Multiple-Variations-3"><a href="#04Design-Multiple-Variations-3" class="headerlink" title="04Design Multiple Variations"></a>04Design Multiple Variations</h3><p>It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A&#x2F;B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.</p>
<h3 id="05Use-GIF-Format-3"><a href="#05Use-GIF-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="05Use GIF Format"></a>05Use GIF Format</h3><p>Finally, once your <strong>motion graphics animation</strong> is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.</p>

<p>Today there is a lot pre-made skeletons you can use and reuse as many times as you want, making only a few minor adjustments to the base design. If your creativity is sparking like firecrackers, then a rig can make it look more defined and&#x2F;or realistic.</p>
<p>Not convinced? Let’s talk more about <strong>Rigging Animation</strong>.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>
<h3 id="04Intro-to-Rigging-Software"><a href="#04Intro-to-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="04Intro to Rigging Software"></a>04Intro to Rigging Software</h3><p>You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.</p>
<p>Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.</p>
<p>Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.</p>
<p>Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.</p>
<p>You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.</p>

Maya is probably the one software which gives you credit for just knowing it.</p>
<p>Maya has several levels of features you need to practice before you can call yourself a Maya master.</p>
<p>The best way to get your hands practiced on animating on Maya is by becoming well versed with all the stats and proportions while working with rigs. You would surely need to get your hands on high quality rig packages that makes the learning experience even more worth it.</p>
<p>With time, you would get better at understanding of the specifics of building a structure you would be showing in the final result. However getting stuck with the wrong type of rig can end up making your animating experience counterintuitive.</p>

<p>This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.</p>
<p>What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.</p>
<h3 id="02How-Does-Rigging-Work-3"><a href="#02How-Does-Rigging-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="02How Does Rigging Work?"></a>02How Does Rigging Work?</h3><p>The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.</p>
<p>There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the <strong>skeletal structure</strong> which is the basic goal in <strong>rigging animation.</strong></p>
<p>With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.</p>
<p>The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.</p>
<p>These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.</p>
<p>This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.</p>
<p>Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.</p>
<p>All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.</p>
<h3 id="03How-is-Rigging-Used-3"><a href="#03How-is-Rigging-Used-3" class="headerlink" title="03How is Rigging Used?"></a>03How is Rigging Used?</h3><p>Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.</p>
<p>Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.</p>
<p>There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.</p>
<p>This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.</p>
<h3 id="04Intro-to-Rigging-Software-3"><a href="#04Intro-to-Rigging-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="04Intro to Rigging Software"></a>04Intro to Rigging Software</h3><p>You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.</p>
<p>Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.</p>
<p>Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.</p>
<p>Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.</p>
<p>You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.</p>

Maya is probably the one software which gives you credit for just knowing it.</p>
<p>Maya has several levels of features you need to practice before you can call yourself a Maya master.</p>
<p>The best way to get your hands practiced on animating on Maya is by becoming well versed with all the stats and proportions while working with rigs. You would surely need to get your hands on high quality rig packages that makes the learning experience even more worth it.</p>
<p>With time, you would get better at understanding of the specifics of building a structure you would be showing in the final result. However getting stuck with the wrong type of rig can end up making your animating experience counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Here is a list of Maya Rigs you can start on right away;</p>

Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

<p>Photo Cartoon is an <strong>online photo animator</strong> that specifically alters your photos and ‘cartoon-izes’ it (with several effects to choose from as to the specific style that you want). This single-use, while definitely not the most advanced on this list of ours, offers the user an easy way to change the look of their photographs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transform photos into cartoons, paintings, drawings, and caricatures.</p>

<p>With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools. This one works quite simply as well though. Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a cartoon version of your images easily and quickly.</p>

<p>Although not very well-known, ASPOSE is an easy way of animating pictures online. All you really have to do is upload your file (in the way that is suggested) and you’re good to go. You’ll be given a choice in what kind of animations you want to put on your photograph thereafter. And, when the conversion is complete, it’ll be FREE to download and share.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Some photo to animation converters will allow you to completely change the look of your photograph with a single application of a filter. While others are more involved (and thus, more flexible) and require more careful customization.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> We’ve included both types (and all the types between) in our list of photo to animation converters. Hopefully, you’ll find one that can help you make the animated pictures that you want to make.</p>
