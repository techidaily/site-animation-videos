<p>We do have a couple of recommendations to give. There’s a wide variety of tools out there that will allow you to <strong>make animated pictures</strong>.

<p>The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an <strong>online photo animator</strong> and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.</p>

<p>With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools. This one works quite simply as well though. Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>

You’ll be given a choice in what kind of animations you want to put on your photograph thereafter. And, when the conversion is complete, it’ll be FREE to download and share.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

<h3 id="02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker"><a href="#02Color-Cartoon-Caricature-Maker" class="headerlink" title="02Color Cartoon Caricature Maker"></a>02<strong>Color Cartoon Caricature Maker</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>caricature maker</strong> app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a <strong>political caricature</strong> of famous individuals and politicians. It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<h3 id="03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#03PicMagic-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>03<strong>PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>Up next, we have ‘Pic Magic’ which is better described as a ‘cartoon photo editor’ but still works as a serviceable <strong>caricature maker</strong> if all you’re looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the <strong>political caricature</strong> maker we showed previously.)</p>
<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007" >https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

<h3 id="05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor"><a href="#05ToonApp-Cartoon-Photo-Editor" class="headerlink" title="05ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor"></a>05<strong>ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor</strong></h3><p>‘ToonApp’ is the next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

<h3 id="06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo"><a href="#06Voila-AI-Artist-Cartoon-Photo" class="headerlink" title="06Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo"></a>06<strong>Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo</strong></h3><p>This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature"><a href="#08Face-Caricature" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There’s a surprisingly large amount of both <strong>caricature photo maker</strong> apps and <strong>online caricature maker</strong> tools.</p>
<p>Today, we’ll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we’ve even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong>.</p>

We’ll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it’s important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)</p>
<h3 id="011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1"><a href="#011-MomentCam-Cartoons-Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="011. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers"></a>01<strong>1. MomentCam Cartoons &amp; Stickers</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>caricature maker</strong> apps on our list is ‘MomentCam Cartoon &amp; Stickers’ — this app is part of another tool called ‘Avatar Maker Bundle’, but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).</p>
<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

<h3 id="04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-1"><a href="#04Photic-Cartoon-Yourself-AI-1" class="headerlink" title="04Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI"></a>04<strong>Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI</strong></h3><p>This next app, called ‘Photic’ is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

<h3 id="08Face-Caricature-1"><a href="#08Face-Caricature-1" class="headerlink" title="08Face Caricature"></a>08<strong>Face Caricature</strong></h3><p>The next <strong>caricature maker</strong> on our list is the app called ‘Face Caricature.’ The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several ‘caricature’ styles that you can choose from. So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.</p>

It’s just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual <strong>caricature sketch</strong>. The best part about it is that it’s basically a custom <strong>caricature maker</strong> — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

It’s called ‘Color Cartoon Caricature Maker’ and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)</p>

<p>Much like the second app, while it’s more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, it can <strong>make a caricature of a photo</strong> but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a ‘cartoony’ style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

So, you aren’t stuck with just one cartoon style. It’s better for selfies, however — it doesn’t work as well as a group picture <strong>caricature maker</strong>.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your <strong>caricature pictures</strong> on social media.</p>

Keep that in mind.</p>
<p>The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished <strong>caricature pictures</strong> with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.</p>

As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.</p>

It’s called ‘Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo’ and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.</p>
<p>This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.</p>

<p>It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the ‘morph’ effect to everyone.</p>

Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we’ve also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.</strong></p>
<p>Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you’re not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.</p>
<p>When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your <strong>caricature sketch</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png"
                      alt="Find a Portrait for Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Exaggerate Features.</strong></p>
<p>What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that’s enlarging the person’s head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There’s an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.</p>
<p>Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don’t have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..</p>
<p>Just let your imagination run wild.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png"
                      alt="Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.</strong></p>
<p>And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.</p>
<p>And, if you’re going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There’s a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that’s possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

<p>Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Animation"><a href="#023D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="023D Animation"></a>023D Animation</h3><p>In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations"><a href="#Part-2-Part-Key-Differences-Between-2d-Animations-and-3d-Animations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations"></a>Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations</h2><p>The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.</p>
<p>The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Part-Merging-2D-Animation-and-3D-Animation"><a href="#Part-4-Part-Merging-2D-Animation-and-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Part Merging 2D Animation and 3D Animation"></a>Part 4 Part Merging 2D Animation and 3D Animation</h2><p>Why choose one, when both can be used? Yes, to get the best of both worlds, 2D animations can be used along with 3D animations depending on the type of the project. Both the styles can be adjusted as per the requirements and for this, good professional software is needed.</p>

<p>Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom &amp; Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.</p>

A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.</p>

Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.</p>
