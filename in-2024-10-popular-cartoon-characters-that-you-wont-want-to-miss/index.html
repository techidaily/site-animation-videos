<p>The credibility of LinkedIn carousel posts lies in the engaging presentation of your static and monotonous text to make them stand out of the crowded newsfeed. True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a Commendable File Format</p>
<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make a Careful Upload</p>
<p>When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bonus Tip</p>
<p>To include the latest and up-to-date information within your presentation, consider visiting the LinkedIn official webpage directly from your platform account.</p>

True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>

<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make a Careful Upload</p>
<p>When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.</p>

There are obvious reasons to the fact that anyone would prefer watching a GIF over a video, irrespective of its length. Some major ones that make it quite annoying to watch videos include the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To begin with, you need to turn the video on and off, depending on your choice of watching a video or surfing through stories and feeds, failing which you get to hear additional sounds through your feed from the already running video. You further need to stop the music or go for a volume control in case you are not interested to watch the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most of the videos you run turn up to be irrelevant or uninteresting through the middle, but you don’t have a choice to make bit adjustments. If however possible, the method is not quite convenient. You may need to visit a different site in case you run a video that is not integrated with webpage of your searched content, wait for the portal’s interface to load or watch an advertisement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> GIFs, on the other hand, do not require pausing or turning off, and run automatically. You also don’t need to mute any sounds. These ensure to-the-point message delivery and don’t divert your attention from the primary content you visit the webpage for.</p>
