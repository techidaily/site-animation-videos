All that is need is practice and experiment with different combinations of shapes. This article will guide on how to draw funny cartoon faces of various types using six other steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin, you need to first draw the face outline by drawing the following;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Any Perfect type of round shape like a circle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Any pear shapes</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An upside-down triangle</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A quadrilateral like a trapezium, a square, or any of your choice</p>

                      alt="how to draw funny cartoon faces 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To draw the nose in the middle of the face, draw somewhere any of the following;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A round shape that is bulgy</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shape</p>

                      alt="how to draw funny cartoon faces 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next is that you draw two round shapes for the eyes, and each of them should have a smaller round or dot (for the pupil), which is above the nose. This eye can be in the shape of any of the following;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Two large circles</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> An ovals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A curvy “M,” like the one you can see in the “McDonalds” logo.</p>

                      alt="how to draw funny cartoon faces 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can draw the mouth just below the nose and draw any of the shapes from the list given below. In addition, to make the mouth funnier, you should then add teeth by either drawing a small square sticking out inside the mouth from the upper side, at the roof of the mouth, or a straight horizontal line which is across the mouth and several vertical lines used to form a grid having two rows and many columns.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A triangle like a right-angled one which is most preferred</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A circle or an oval shape</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A rectangle shapes</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A straight line shapes</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 05"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 11"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 12"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A U-shaped curve that is large</p>

<p>Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:</p>
<p>Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, you draw the face but make sure you don’t add a nose but do a black outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don’t use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 02"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 03"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 06"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 07"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 08"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 09"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.</p>

                      alt="how to draw your own cartoon character 10"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.</p>

<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

<h3 id="01VisEngine-1"><a href="#01VisEngine-1" class="headerlink" title="01VisEngine"></a>01<strong>VisEngine</strong></h3><p>The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is “VisEngine.” They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you’re curious as to the look of their finished <strong>architectural animations</strong>, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out</p>
<h3 id="02Exodo-Animation-Studios-1"><a href="#02Exodo-Animation-Studios-1" class="headerlink" title="02Exodo Animation Studios"></a>02<strong>Exodo Animation Studios</strong></h3><p>“Exodo Animation Studios” is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They’ve had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI</p>
<h3 id="03Promoshin-1"><a href="#03Promoshin-1" class="headerlink" title="03Promoshin"></a>03<strong>Promoshin</strong></h3><p>Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn’t mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they’ve worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)</p>
<h3 id="04ZOA-Studio-1"><a href="#04ZOA-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="04ZOA Studio"></a>04<strong>ZOA Studio</strong></h3><p>ZOA Studio brings us back to <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it’s a great resource for those looking for inspiration)</p>
<h3 id="05Studio-Aiko-1"><a href="#05Studio-Aiko-1" class="headerlink" title="05Studio Aiko"></a>05<strong>Studio Aiko</strong></h3><p>Again, this next studio, called “Studio Aiko” is usually better known for its regular 3D Animation work. However, that doesn’t mean that their <strong>architectural animations</strong> are any lesser in quality They produce very high-quality work fit for any kind of media platform. Making it a fitting solution for many professional architects</p>

These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.</p>
<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> has only continued to grow over the years, we’ve also included this section on the many benefits of <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors</p>
<h3 id="01Detailed-Construction-Requirements-2"><a href="#01Detailed-Construction-Requirements-2" class="headerlink" title="01Detailed Construction Requirements"></a>01<strong>Detailed Construction Requirements</strong></h3><p>As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong>. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Complete-Visual-Touring-2"><a href="#02Complete-Visual-Touring-2" class="headerlink" title="02Complete Visual Touring"></a>02<strong>Complete Visual Touring</strong></h3><p>Of course, outside of construction parameters, there’s also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.</p>

<h3 id="03Scope-and-Scale-of-Project-2"><a href="#03Scope-and-Scale-of-Project-2" class="headerlink" title="03Scope and Scale of Project"></a>03<strong>Scope and Scale of Project</strong></h3><p>Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that’s important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there’s any.)</p>

<h3 id="04Architectural-Animations-Easily-Shareable-2"><a href="#04Architectural-Animations-Easily-Shareable-2" class="headerlink" title="04Architectural Animations Easily Shareable"></a>04<strong>Architectural Animations Easily Shareable</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this in passing previously, but <strong>architectural animations</strong> are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full</p>
<p>Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished’ property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.</p>

<h3 id="05Customer-Reassurance-Boost-2"><a href="#05Customer-Reassurance-Boost-2" class="headerlink" title="05Customer Reassurance Boost"></a>05<strong>Customer Reassurance Boost</strong></h3><p>Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It’s quite relieving, as we’re certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.</p>

If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you’ve got the look right this time around</p>
<p>No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.</p>

A <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that’s important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there’s any.)</p>

Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full</p>
<p>Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished’ property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.</p>

It’s quite relieving, as we’re certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.</p>

If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you’ve got the look right this time around</p>
<p>No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.</p>

Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img

<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between.

<p>Childhood crushes and idolization of <strong>animated characters</strong> were very normal things! <strong>Popular animated characters</strong> were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!</p>
<p>Today, in order to reminisce a little, we’ll be going through some of the more <strong>famous animated characters</strong>!</p>
<p>Although we initially promised only 15 <strong>animated characters</strong>, we’ve stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more <strong>popular animated characters</strong> to reminisce about! We’ve also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!</p>
<h3 id="01Mickey-Mouse"><a href="#01Mickey-Mouse" class="headerlink" title="01Mickey Mouse"></a>01Mickey Mouse</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Steamboat Willie (1928)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine</p>
<p>When it comes to admirable <strong>animated characters</strong>, Disney’s Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune! He merited the top spot simply for that fame, even though, in all honesty, his time on the big screen had been pretty limited (with his biggest performance having been from Fantasia).</p>

<h3 id="02Woody"><a href="#02Woody" class="headerlink" title="02Woody"></a>02Woody</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tom Hanks</p>
<p>We of course also cannot forget Toy Story’s Woody in a discussion of <strong>famous animated characters</strong>. This cowboy toy comes equipped with a pull-string that just oozes personality (both good and bad), leading up to a very satisfying movie-watching experience as we watch him grow from the selfish toy that he had been in the beginning to the generous, and forgiving toy that he developed into by the fourth movie in the series!</p>

<h3 id="03Buzz-Lightyear"><a href="#03Buzz-Lightyear" class="headerlink" title="03Buzz Lightyear"></a>03Buzz Lightyear</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tim Allen</p>
<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Finding Nemo (2003)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>Dory was undoubtedly the underdog of the Finding Nemo franchise! This lovable fish, <strong>Voiced by</strong> the equally loveable Ellen DeGeneres, stole the show and earned herself her own feature film that all the animated movie lovers came to watch in 2016! Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Hitoshi Takagi</p>
<p>Speaking of cute characters, how can one forget about Totoro! Despite having been written in a different language, ‘My Neighbor Totoro’ has managed to burrow its way into the hearts of many a movie watcher. And of course, this is all things to the loveable animated character, Totoro — who is cuddly, gentle, and peaceful!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Aladdin (1992)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Robin Williams</p>
<p>When talking about <strong>animated characters</strong>, one must also not forget the phenomenal performance of Genie from the Aladdin franchise! <strong>Voiced by</strong> Robin Williams, Genie was brought to life in a way that changed the industry for good, bringing an influx of more lively voice acting in the future!</p>
<p>If you’re the type to want to <strong>make your animated character</strong>, taking inspiration from Robin William’s Genie would surely not lead you astray! In fact, you can get started on it today, if you wanted!

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Cameo in Cars (2006)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ben Burtt</p>
<p>Wall-E broke the box office for its underlying message regarding how we humans treat our world, but also because of its loveable characters! Who can say that they did not fall in love with Wall-E and his darling Eve? Despite his almost-mute character, he was brought to life in a way that made him very easy to love and would be remembered for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: 101 Dalmatians</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Betty Lou Gerson</p>
<p>When it comes to classic villain <strong>animated characters</strong>, one cannot forget about the illustrious Cruella de Vil! This character was pure evil in a feminine form! Designed to be the enemy of puppy lovers everywhere all while bringing a little spice into what would have otherwise been a sweet, slice of life film.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.</p>

<h3 id="13Chihiro"><a href="#13Chihiro" class="headerlink" title="13Chihiro"></a>13Chihiro</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Spirited Away (2001)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase</p>
<p>The story of Chihiro from ‘Spirited Away’ is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget! This character, if you weren’t aware, was also created by Miyazaki (the same creator of ‘Totoro!’) She’s a part of a long line of greatly designed and developed characters whose journey you just can’t look away from.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jerry Orbach</p>
<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved <strong>Disney Animated Characters</strong>, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (<strong>Voiced by</strong> Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the ‘Be Our Guest’ track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast’s love story.</p>

<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Chieko Baisho; Emily Mortimer &amp; Jean Simmons</p>
<p>To wrap up our main list, we have another Miyazaki character in the form of Sophie — from Howl’s Moving Castle! Howl’s Moving Castle is another beautiful classic that you just can’t help but love, and a lot of that is all thanks to its complex and believable heroine, Sophie!</p>

<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.</p>

<p>The story of Chihiro from ‘Spirited Away’ is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget!

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Beauty and the Beast (1991)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Jerry Orbach</p>
<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved <strong>Disney Animated Characters</strong>, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (<strong>Voiced by</strong> Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the ‘Be Our Guest’ track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast’s love story.</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: How To Train Your Dragon</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: N&#x2F;A</p>
<p>A more modern, but no-less loveable <strong>animated character</strong> that we all know and love is Toothless from ‘How to Train Your Dragon!’ Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.</p>

<p>The story of Chihiro from ‘Spirited Away’ is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget!

<p>‘Beauty and the Beast’ is a Disney classic!

This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the ‘Be Our Guest’ track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast’s love story.</p>

<p>Childhood crushes and idolization of <strong>animated characters</strong> were very normal things! <strong>Popular animated characters</strong> were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!</p>
<p>Today, in order to reminisce a little, we’ll be going through some of the more <strong>famous animated characters</strong>!</p>
<p>Although we initially promised only 15 <strong>animated characters</strong>, we’ve stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more <strong>popular animated characters</strong> to reminisce about! We’ve also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!</p>
<h3 id="01Mickey-Mouse-3"><a href="#01Mickey-Mouse-3" class="headerlink" title="01Mickey Mouse"></a>01Mickey Mouse</h3><p><strong>Movie(s)</strong>: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)</p>
<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Steamboat Willie (1928)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine</p>
<p>When it comes to admirable <strong>animated characters</strong>, Disney’s Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune! He merited the top spot simply for that fame, even though, in all honesty, his time on the big screen had been pretty limited (with his biggest performance having been from Fantasia).</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tom Hanks</p>
<p>We of course also cannot forget Toy Story’s Woody in a discussion of <strong>famous animated characters</strong>. This cowboy toy comes equipped with a pull-string that just oozes personality (both good and bad), leading up to a very satisfying movie-watching experience as we watch him grow from the selfish toy that he had been in the beginning to the generous, and forgiving toy that he developed into by the fourth movie in the series!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Toy Story (1995)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Tim Allen</p>
<p>Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as <strong>animated characters</strong> go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear’s growth from a delusional ‘space-ranger-wannabe’ into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!</p>

<p><strong>First Appearance</strong>: Finding Nemo (2003)</p>
<p><strong>Voiced by</strong>: Ellen DeGeneres</p>
<p>Dory was undoubtedly the underdog of the Finding Nemo franchise!

Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.</p>
