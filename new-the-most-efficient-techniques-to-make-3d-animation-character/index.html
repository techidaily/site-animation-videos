<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation"></a>Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation</h2><p>Animators follow a list of strict principles to create the most inspiring projects. And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                      alt="squash and stretch animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation"><a href="#02Anticipation" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing"><a href="#04Timing" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun"><a href="#01It-is-fun" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression"><a href="#02Lasting-impression" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget"><a href="#01Budget" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience"><a href="#03Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market"><a href="#04Market" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch-1"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch-1" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

<h3 id="02Anticipation-1"><a href="#02Anticipation-1" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out-1"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out-1" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

<h3 id="04Timing-1"><a href="#04Timing-1" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing-1"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing-1" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun-1"><a href="#01It-is-fun-1" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-1"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-1" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-1"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-1" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>

However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-1"><a href="#01Budget-1" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-1"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-1" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-1"><a href="#03Target-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-1"><a href="#04Market-1" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-1"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-1" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-2D-Animation-Easy-How-Do-You-Learn-It-3"><a href="#Part-1-Is-2D-Animation-Easy-How-Do-You-Learn-It-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is 2D Animation Easy &amp; How Do You Learn It?"></a>Part 1 Is 2D Animation Easy &amp; How Do You Learn It?</h2><p>In 2020, the video became the #1 form of media for content strategy, overtaking infographics and blogs. Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation"></a>Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation</h2><p>Animators follow a list of strict principles to create the most inspiring projects. And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch-3"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch-3" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation-3"><a href="#02Anticipation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out-3"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out-3" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                      alt="ease in animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing-3"><a href="#04Timing-3" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing-3"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing-3" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun-3"><a href="#01It-is-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-3"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-3" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-3"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-3" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-3"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-3"><a href="#01Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-3"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-3" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-3"><a href="#03Target-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-3"><a href="#04Market-3" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-GIF"><a href="#Part-1-Why-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why GIF?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why GIF?</strong></h2><p>Before we move on to the tutorials, let’s do a brief account on GIF files We’ve also answered some of the more common questions regarding using a <strong>GIF image maker</strong> below for your edification</p>
<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>
<h3 id="02There-Are-Jaggy-Strokes-Around-Gif"><a href="#02There-Are-Jaggy-Strokes-Around-Gif" class="headerlink" title="02There Are Jaggy Strokes Around Gif?"></a>02<strong>There Are Jaggy Strokes Around Gif?</strong></h3><p>Another issue that you might suffer from while trying to <strong>create GIFs from photos</strong> is jaggy or raggedy strokes around the GIF when converted. These occur often with GIF makers that support transparency If you find these happening to you, adjust the transparency settings to get rid of the white pixel outline around your converted GIF.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>
<p>URL: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://loading.io/animation/icon/" >https://loading.io/animation/icon/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

                      alt="Launch Online GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>

                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img

<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif16.png"
                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif17.png"
                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>

<p>Keep in mind that it’s not a single video, but a series of episodes that’ll walk you through the basics of Blender and how to start with your first 2D&#x2F;3D animation. If you are serious about working with Blender, this series is your one-stop solution to get familiar with the application.</p>
<h3 id="4-Character-Creation-and-Rigging-3"><a href="#4-Character-Creation-and-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Character Creation and Rigging"></a>4. Character Creation and Rigging</h3><p>Every 2D animation requires at least one character that would act as the main subject of the animation. And, in case you are planning to create a 3D animation with extensive movement, you’ll also have to incorporate Rigging to ensure that any movement looks realistic.</p>
<p>This video is for anyone who has a basic understanding of 2D animation in Blender and wants to step up their game. Here you’ll learn how to design a specific character on the canvas and how to use rigging to configure its movement. Again, this is not a single video, but a series of episodes, which means it would be better if you sit with your coffee in your hand.</p>

CG Geek’s 2D Animation Tutorial in Blender</h3><p>Now, if you are specifically looking for a video that only talks about Blender 2D animations and nothing else, this tutorial by CG Geek is the most suitable option. In this video, CG Geek goes on explaining how to use the Grease Pencil feature in Blender for 2D animation. He has also explained how to keyframe your 2D animation on Blender’s timeline so that any movement looks as realistic as possible.</p>

Wondershare Filmora - A Reliable Alternative to Blender for Video Editors"></a>6. Wondershare Filmora - A Reliable Alternative to Blender for Video Editors</h3><p>Now, if you are a video editor and only want to create an animation for one of your videos, it would not be a wise decision to use Blender. Why? Because the tool has a steep learning curve and it’s not worth investing your time if you only want to create a 10-seconds animation. So, what’s the next best solution?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. It’s a full-scale video editing tool that’s designed to help editors enhance their productivity through ready-to-use templates. It has a built-in media library where you’ll find dozens of animation templates. You can simply drag these templates to your timeline and customize them to match the overall theme of your video itself.</p>
<p>With its timeline-based editing panel, you’ll be able to speed up the overall editing process and create visually stunning videos in no time. The tool also has a stack of ready-to-use transitions, special effects, and sounds that you can apply to the video and improve the overall production quality. In short, if your only goal is to add a 2D animation to your video, it won’t be a wise decision to rely on Blender. Instead, download and install Wondershare Filmora Pro on your system and use it to edit the video.</p>
