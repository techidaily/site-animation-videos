<p>GIFs add fun and humor to interactions via text messages. GIFs allow you to convey ideas, emotions, and thoughts in much more precise ways than an emoji would. iPhones operating on iOS 10 or later versions have an in-built GIF keyboard, making it super easy to add GIFs. iPhone text GIFs are readily accessible from GIF keyboards. Still, if you do not have one, you can resort to third-party applications like GIPHY and GIF keyboard for more prominent access to GIF libraries.</p>

Hence, we dedicated this part to teaching you how to use <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> to revitalize and better express yourself while texting.</p>
<p>On iPhone, there are two different ways to send iPhone text GIFs – employing the default keyboard or through the help of third-party apps. You can use the iOS default keyboard to search for GIFs in iMessage on iPhones directly. This applies to all iPhones running on iOS 10 and later versions. If your iPhone belongs to this category, follow the simple steps to add <strong>GIFs in text messages on iPhone</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard"><a href="#01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard"></a>01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard</h3><p>Here’s how you can send <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> using the iOS default keyboard:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-3.jpg"
                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-5.jpg"
                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-6.jpg"
                      alt="select your desired GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Send icon, represented as a blue arrow icon, to send your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hit send"
                ></p>
<p>You can add comments to a GIF just before sending it on the iMessage app. Type a message under the GIF before clicking “Send” to get the comment delivered together with the GIF.</p>
<p>From these simple steps, you can tell that sending a GIF from an iOS default keyboard is straightforward.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click the smiley icon on the keyboard &gt; Swipe to browse through GIFs and stickers or enter a search text to find your desired GIF.</p>

                      alt="launch message and click start"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select the GIF you want by clicking on it &gt; Hit Send.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Search for your desired GIF on GIPHY or other GIF websites.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Long press on the GIF, and from the pop-up options, click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="long press on the GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch Messages, click the Write icon and enter the person’s contact details you want to text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on the text box"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click on the text box again to add the paste option.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="click again to bring up the paste option "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: When the GIF appears, click Paste.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: A preview of the GIF would appear on the text box. Hit Send when you’re ready to send the GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tap send"
                ></p>
<p>If you use a GIF website other than GIPHY, the sent GIF may appear as a link rather than an image. If you’re okay with that, make sure the address of the shared animated image you end with the file extension, “.gif” if not, iMessage would not be able to load it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="click again to bring up the paste option "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: When the GIF appears, click Paste.</p>

                      alt="click paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: A preview of the GIF would appear on the text box. Hit Send when you’re ready to send the GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tap send"
                ></p>
<p>If you use a GIF website other than GIPHY, the sent GIF may appear as a link rather than an image. If you’re okay with that, make sure the address of the shared animated image you end with the file extension, “.gif” if not, iMessage would not be able to load it.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can also create GIFs from video files, but you should keep in mind that the sound is going to be removed automatically, as GIF files cannot contain audio.</p>

<p>In case you want to create a GIF out of photos, you will have to take a number of consecutive photos with your camera and then merge them into a GIF. The number of photos you will have to take depends on the duration of the GIF you want to create, and it varies from just five to more than one thousand.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can also create GIFs from video files, but you should keep in mind that the sound is going to be removed automatically, as GIF files cannot contain audio.</p>

<h3 id="01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="01Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal’ by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you’re confused, it’s a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.</p>
<p>Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.</p>
<h3 id="02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title"><a href="#02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title" class="headerlink" title="02Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title"></a>02<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title</strong></a></h3><p>The next <strong>text motion</strong> template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title’ also created by Mogrt. This one is <strong>text motion graphics</strong> that you can use for <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It’s a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!</p>
<p>As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as <strong>text motion</strong> for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt" >after effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is available for that as well!</p>
<h3 id="03Simple-Motion-Text-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#03Simple-Motion-Text-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="03Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro"></a>03<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?_ga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text’ graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we’ve provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that’s just starting out and doesn’t want anything too complicated.</p>
<h3 id="0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt"><a href="#0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="0430 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt"></a>04<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?_ga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets’ by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It’s also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it’s not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch’ effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn’t make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!</p>
<p>The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT"><a href="#05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT" class="headerlink" title="05Comic Bubbles MOGRT"></a>05<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?_ga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Comic Bubbles MOGRT</strong></a></h3><p>Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles’, kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that’s the kind of look that you’re looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic’ text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy’ text in between animated projects.</p>
<p>For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we’ve linked if you want to see it in action!)</p>
<h3 id="06Smoke-To-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#06Smoke-To-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="06Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>06<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?_ga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal’ is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the <strong>text motion graphics</strong> are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It’s perfect for those looking for underwater-themed <strong>text motion graphics</strong>. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.</p>
<p>This is <strong>Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro</strong>. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.</p>

Then, the ‘text messages toolkit’ might be a fun <strong>text motion graphics</strong> for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it’s a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message’ interactions. It’s customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that’s what you want.</p>
<h3 id="08Large-Text-Title-Block"><a href="#08Large-Text-Title-Block" class="headerlink" title="08Large Text Title Block"></a>08<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/"><strong>Large Text Title Block</strong></a></h3><p>With the ‘large text title block’ template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects.
