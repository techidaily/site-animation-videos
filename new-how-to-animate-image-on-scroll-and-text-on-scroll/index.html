<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Launch Filmora on your system and import the video&#x2F;image that you want to edit. Then, load the selected file to Filmora’s timeline to proceed further.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Now, double-tap the video&#x2F;image. This will launch the editing panel on your screen. Here, switch to the “Animation” panel.</p>

                      alt="animation presets filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Here you can either select “Presets” or click the “Customize” tab to create a custom animation through keyframing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> If you want to save time, however, it would be better to choose the “Presets” tab. Then, select the preset that you want to use.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Now, drag the selected preset to the timeline. Again, double-tap the preset layer. An editing panel will appear on your screen. Here you can adjust different elements of the preset to customize its playback.</p>

<h3 id="02Use-ScrollSequence"><a href="#02Use-ScrollSequence" class="headerlink" title="02Use ScrollSequence"></a>02Use ScrollSequence</h3><p>Now, if you are not a professional editor or don’t want to overcomplicate things, you can use ScrollSequence to add image-on-scroll animation to your website. For readers who don’t know, ScrollSequence is a built-in WordPress plugin that you can directly install in your WordPress manager. The tool offers hundreds of ready-to-use animation templates that you can integrate and customize without any hassle.</p>
<p>All the templates offer complete customization, which means you can adjust the animation playback, import your own media files, and even customize the text. It’s worth understanding that this method will only work if you are using WordPress as the CMS platform for your website. ScrollSequence is only available as a WordPress plugin and you won’t be able to use it with any other website builder</p>
<h3 id="03Write-Your-Own-JavaScript-Code"><a href="#03Write-Your-Own-JavaScript-Code" class="headerlink" title="03Write Your Own JavaScript Code"></a>03Write Your Own JavaScript Code</h3><p>Finally, you can also write your own JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll. However, this method will be a bit complicated as you would require technical expertise to write dedicated JavaScript scripts to animate image-on-scroll.

Text-on-scroll animations work the same way as image-on-scroll animations - the only difference is that these types of animations focus on the text playback instead of images. Again, you can use different methods to <strong>animate text on scroll</strong> and make your website’s content run in an infinite loop.</p>
<p>Some of these methods include:</p>
<h3 id="01Use-Filmora-1"><a href="#01Use-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="01Use Filmora"></a>01Use Filmora</h3><p>Thanks to Filmora’s advanced editing panel, you can also use it to animate text within the videos.

With Filmora, you’ll be able to animate the text and make custom transitions in a hassle-free manner. Let’s walk you through the detailed procedure of using Wondershare Filmora to add text animation to your videos.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Open Filmora on your system and load the video into its timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Double-tap the video file, and switch to the “Titles” tab. You’ll see a list of different title templates on your screen. Browse through these results and drag the desired template to the timelines. Make sure to adjust the title layer right above the video layer.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="choose title template filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Again, double-click the title layer and you’ll see a dedicated text editor on your screen. Here enter the text that you want to display within the video. You can also select text size, orientation, and font to personalize its appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Finally, switch to the “Animation” tab at the left sidebar. Choose any of these animation templates and the text within the video will be animated automatically.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life"><a href="#02Observe-real-life" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>

<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>

Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>

                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>

<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>

Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>

It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life-1"><a href="#02Observe-real-life-1" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key-1"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key-1" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important-1"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important-1" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>

<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>

It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-2"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-2"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-2" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life-2"><a href="#02Observe-real-life-2" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key-2"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key-2" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again-2"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again-2" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important-2"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important-2" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?</h2><p><strong>2D animation</strong> is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-3"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-3"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-3" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life-3"><a href="#02Observe-real-life-3" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key-3"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key-3" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again-3"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again-3" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important-3"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important-3" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-3"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-3"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>

Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>

This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.</p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.</p>
<p>Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>
<p>This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although <strong>Adobe 3D animation</strong> can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.</p>
<p>This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.</p>
<p>It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.</p>
<h3 id="01How-is-After-Effects-used-3"><a href="#01How-is-After-Effects-used-3" class="headerlink" title="01How is After Effects used?"></a>01How is After Effects used?</h3><p>The primary uses of After Effects categorize into three sections:</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Animation</strong>, and</p>
<p><strong>Compositing.</strong></p>
<p>The kind of animation for which After Effects is widely used is Motion Graphics, which includes making the motion of traditionally static objects such as text, logos, and other graphic elements.</p>
<p>Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.</p>
<p>It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.</p>
<h3 id="02Who-uses-After-Effects-3"><a href="#02Who-uses-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="02Who uses After Effects?"></a>02Who uses After Effects?</h3><p>The After Effects is valuable to animators, visual artists, advertising agencies, video editors, video artists, video producers, social media professionals, motion graphics designers, UX professionals, etc. Gaining proficiency in After Effects comes in-depth from training, tutorials, and other hands-on use courses.</p>
