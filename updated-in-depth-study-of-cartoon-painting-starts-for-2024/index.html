<p><strong>Cartoon painting</strong> is slowly becoming popular due to its many benefits, especially <strong>easy cartoon canvas painting</strong>. For instance, it is pretty eye-grabbing, especially if your audience is children.</p>

<p>Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Draw a Cartoon Character for Beginners?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [Is There Anything else You Can Do to Draw Cartoons More Quickly?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Good-Cartoons-to-Draw"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Good-Cartoons-to-Draw" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?"></a>Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?</h2><p>As far as good cartoons are concerned, expect about 5 popular types. These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="illustrative cartoons"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels"><a href="#03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels" class="headerlink" title="03 Comic Strips or Panels"></a>03 Comic Strips or Panels</h3><p>In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.</p>
<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

                      alt="Comic Strips or Panels"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Gag Cartoons"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons"><a href="#05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="05 Editorial or Political Cartoons"></a>05 Editorial or Political Cartoons</h3><p>These cartoons are also made for the newspapers. Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing"><a href="#Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing"></a>Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing</h5><p>Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.</p>
<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

To achieve that, make the nose look close to the eyes</p>

That’s one common characteristic of an old character, especially male.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<p>Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-1"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-1"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons-1"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>

If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>

If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-2"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-2" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-3"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-3"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-3"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-3"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-3"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>

<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-3"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>

<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character.

                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>

<h4 id="Method-2-Copy-and-Paste"><a href="#Method-2-Copy-and-Paste" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Copy and Paste"></a>Method 2: Copy and Paste</h4><p> A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first.

<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>

The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.</p>
<p> Here we recommend the method 1 and 2, the method 3 will take a little time while Powerpoint downloading the GIF picture.</p>

<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now. People who use this application make a common mistake of using too many slides with huge amounts of text and that is a major turnoff for the audience. Huge text is seen as a disaster. You should be able to convey an interesting story to your attentive audience without explaining every single detail on your slides for your presentation.

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX"><a href="#05IKMAX" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in introducing animations into your content but you don’t have the time or the patience to get too involved with <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-2"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-2"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-2" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro-2"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-2"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-2" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-2"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-2" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX-2"><a href="#05IKMAX-2" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-3"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-20"><a href="#In-this-article-20" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg"
                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animations in unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.</p>

Why? Because Unity is more suitable for animating objects for games. Not to mention, Unity has a steep learning curve and if you are not an experienced Unity developer, you may fail to create a 2D animation properly.</p>
<p>So, if you only need a 2D animation for videos, we have a better alternative for the job. Instead of Unity, you can use <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.

<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-23"><a href="#In-this-article-23" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg"
                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg"
                      alt="animations in unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.</p>

Why? Because Unity is more suitable for animating objects for games. Not to mention, Unity has a steep learning curve and if you are not an experienced Unity developer, you may fail to create a 2D animation properly.</p>
<p>So, if you only need a 2D animation for videos, we have a better alternative for the job. Instead of Unity, you can use <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> for the job.
