<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

<p><strong>Votes</strong>: 51,043</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Goofy Movie is not actually a TV show, but it is a part of the list of the best <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> on IMDB because it was based on an established television series called ‘Goof Troop’ The movie saw its premiere in 1995 and it starts off a couple of years after the end of the Goof Troop show.</p>

Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action&#x2F;adventure show.</p>
<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 All You Need to Know About Rigging"></a>Part 1 <strong>All You Need to Know About Rigging</strong></h2><p>For this first part, we’re going to talk about <strong>Rigging</strong> in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

<h3 id="03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software"><a href="#03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software" class="headerlink" title="03What is Animation Rigging Software?"></a>03<strong>What is Animation Rigging Software?</strong></h3><p>Now, for the last section of this <strong>Rigging</strong> overview, let’s talk about <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

<h3 id="02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations"><a href="#02Time-Investments-for-Creating-and-Animations" class="headerlink" title="02Time Investments for Creating and Animations"></a>02<strong>Time Investments for Creating and Animations</strong></h3><p>Next, let’s talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker"><a href="#05Animaker" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro"><a href="#06Moho-Pro" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D"><a href="#07Pencil-2D" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz"><a href="#08OpenToonz" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-12"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-12" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker-1"><a href="#05Animaker-1" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro-1"><a href="#06Moho-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D-1"><a href="#07Pencil-2D-1" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz-1"><a href="#08OpenToonz-1" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-13"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-13" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get a head start in <strong>2D Rigging</strong> or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing <strong>2D Rigging</strong> in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren’t familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging-2"><a href="#Part-1-All-You-Need-to-Know-About-Rigging-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 All You Need to Know About Rigging"></a>Part 1 <strong>All You Need to Know About Rigging</strong></h2><p>For this first part, we’re going to talk about <strong>Rigging</strong> in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-2"><a href="#01What-is-the-Meaning-of-Rigging-in-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="01What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?"></a>01<strong>What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what does <strong>rigging 2D</strong> characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it’s or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones’ to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.</p>
<p>If you’re an artist, then you’re probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what you do when <strong>Rigging</strong>. You’re building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.</p>

<h3 id="02Why-Use-Animation-2"><a href="#02Why-Use-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Why Use Animation?"></a>02<strong>Why Use Animation?</strong></h3><p>Alright, so what’s the difference between creating a <strong>Face Rig</strong> and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.</p>
<p>A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn’t come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.</p>
<p>You should consider the subject more based on what project you’re working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.</p>
<p>(There’s also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)</p>

<h3 id="03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software-2"><a href="#03What-is-Animation-Rigging-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="03What is Animation Rigging Software?"></a>03<strong>What is Animation Rigging Software?</strong></h3><p>Now, for the last section of this <strong>Rigging</strong> overview, let’s talk about <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong>. You should be able to guess what it’s meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> available.</p>
<p>We’ll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-Difference-and-Connection-Between-and-3D-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D</strong></h2><p>As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.</p>
<h3 id="01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-2"><a href="#01How-and-Animations-Are-Created-2" class="headerlink" title="01How and Animations Are Created"></a>01<strong>How and Animations Are Created</strong></h3><p>First, let’s talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you’re working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.</p>
<p>That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.</p>
<p>This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic <strong>rigging</strong> (i.e., <strong>face rig</strong> for moving mouths or eyes). It’s normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)</p>

This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you’re looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-2"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-2" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom-2"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom-2" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio-2"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE.

<p>You’ll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you’ll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)</p>

As mentioned, we’ve picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these <strong>Rigging</strong> tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)</p>
<h3 id="01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-3"><a href="#01Reallusion-–-Cartoon-Animator-4-3" class="headerlink" title="01Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4"></a>01<strong>Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4</strong></h3><p>The first of the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> on this list is Reallusion’s Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and <strong>Auto Rig</strong> functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.</p>
<h3 id="02Harmony-ToonBoom-3"><a href="#02Harmony-ToonBoom-3" class="headerlink" title="02Harmony ToonBoom"></a>02<strong>Harmony ToonBoom</strong></h3><p>Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> industry. It’s the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob’s Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It’s considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.</p>
<h3 id="03Synfig-Studio-3"><a href="#03Synfig-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="03Synfig Studio"></a>03<strong>Synfig Studio</strong></h3><p>The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable’ and the other in ‘development.’ The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable’ version would serve just as well.</p>
<h3 id="04Adobe-Animate-3"><a href="#04Adobe-Animate-3" class="headerlink" title="04Adobe Animate"></a>04<strong>Adobe Animate</strong></h3><p>Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe’s long line of professional-level products. It’s a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.’ As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there’s a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)</p>
<h3 id="05Animaker-3"><a href="#05Animaker-3" class="headerlink" title="05Animaker"></a>05<strong>Animaker</strong></h3><p>Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that’s what you’d like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)</p>
<h3 id="06Moho-Pro-3"><a href="#06Moho-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="06Moho Pro"></a>06<strong>Moho Pro</strong></h3><p>Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you’re more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced <strong>rigging</strong> functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)</p>
<h3 id="07Pencil-2D-3"><a href="#07Pencil-2D-3" class="headerlink" title="07Pencil 2D"></a>07<strong>Pencil 2D</strong></h3><p>Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It’s quite old, but it’s matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation’ software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it’s best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.</p>
<h3 id="08OpenToonz-3"><a href="#08OpenToonz-3" class="headerlink" title="08OpenToonz"></a>08<strong>OpenToonz</strong></h3><p>OpenToonz is another free <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It’s also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-15"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-15" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure’ or ‘bones’ from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins’ placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re serious about getting into <strong>Rigging</strong>, make sure to consider the <strong>Rigging Animation Software</strong> that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.</p>

Plus how to cartoon yourself with it"></a>Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it</h2><p>We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.</p>

                      alt="voila ai artist"
                ></p>
<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>
<p>If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free &amp; watermark free animated representations.</p>

This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.</p>
<p>Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.</p>
<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.</p>
<p>Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-make-3D-Cartoon-From-a-Photo"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-make-3D-Cartoon-From-a-Photo" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo"></a>Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo</h2><p>Photoshop is no doubt one of the most influential digital assets that allow you to do virtually anything with your photos. Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.</p>
<p>There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.</p>
<p>Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

                      alt="Voila AI Artist"
                ></p>
<p>The Voila AI Artist app was released back in March of 2021 and has been the rage among Disneyfied apps.
