<p><strong>Step 1: Take a photo</strong></p>
<p>Start your Snapchat app as usual and snap a photo or video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-1.jpg"
                      alt="take a photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tap the Sticker icon</strong></p>
<p>From the row on the right side of the screen, tap the Sticker icon.</p>
<p>To add a GIF to your photo or video, scroll down and select one. You can also use the search option to locate more particular GIFs by entering a term or phrase.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="tap sticker icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag GIF</strong></p>
<p>Drag the GIF you added to the screen’s desired location.</p>
<p>Pinch your screen to change the GIF’s size as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save and Share</strong></p>
<p>You can then share your Snap with other social networking platforms by sending it to your Stories, friends&#x2F;contacts, or just saving it to your gallery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Get-GIFs-on-Snapchat-Snaps-and-Messages"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Get-GIFs-on-Snapchat-Snaps-and-Messages" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Get GIFs on Snapchat Snaps and Messages?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Get GIFs on Snapchat Snaps and Messages?</strong></h2><p>Getting a <strong>GIF on Snapchat</strong> can be tasking, but here is a simple guide to achieving that.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-6.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p>You can use the same snap to apply many stickers. Drag and drop it on the trashcan icon to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get Gboard on your Android device if it didn’t come with it:</p>
<p>• Download the Gboard from the Play Store or whichever playstore you want.</p>
<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>
<p>• Double-check that Gboard is selected as your primary keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, grant any permissions it requires so that you can use it right away in Snapchat.</p>
<p>Now that it’s as simple as it gets, let’s send comparable GIFs utilizing iOS devices.</p>
<p>For iPhone&#x2F;iPad:</p>
<p>For iPhone users, you must first download and install the giphy app on your phone. Once you have successfully set the giphy app as your default keyboard, you can send <strong>Snapchat GIFs</strong> chat by following the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Press the Globe icon</strong></p>
<p>Continuously press and hold the globe icon to the left of the space bar to reveal the available keyboard, then choose a specific or favorite GIF from the giphy list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-7.jpg.png"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Find GIF</strong></p>
<p>Find the GIF you wish to send and tap it to copy it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-1.jpg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Tap the Sticker icon</strong></p>
<p>From the row on the right side of the screen, tap the Sticker icon.</p>
<p>To add a GIF to your photo or video, scroll down and select one. You can also use the search option to locate more particular GIFs by entering a term or phrase.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="tap sticker icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag GIF</strong></p>
<p>Drag the GIF you added to the screen’s desired location.</p>
<p>Pinch your screen to change the GIF’s size as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save and Share</strong></p>
<p>You can then share your Snap with other social networking platforms by sending it to your Stories, friends&#x2F;contacts, or just saving it to your gallery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-4.jpg"

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-5.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/snapchat-gif-6.jpg.jpg"
                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p>You can use the same snap to apply many stickers. Drag and drop it on the trashcan icon to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get Gboard on your Android device if it didn’t come with it:</p>
<p>• Download the Gboard from the Play Store or whichever playstore you want.</p>
<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>
<p>• Double-check that Gboard is selected as your primary keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, grant any permissions it requires so that you can use it right away in Snapchat.</p>
<p>Now that it’s as simple as it gets, let’s send comparable GIFs utilizing iOS devices.</p>
<p>For iPhone&#x2F;iPad:</p>
<p>For iPhone users, you must first download and install the giphy app on your phone. Once you have successfully set the giphy app as your default keyboard, you can send <strong>Snapchat GIFs</strong> chat by following the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Press the Globe icon</strong></p>

                ></p>

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Paste GIF</strong></p>
<p>Return to the conversation, paste the GIF into the text box, and press the send button.</p>

Animation video is a craft in which images go through the process of conspiring, layout addition, and photographic chronology to create an illusion of action. In this article, let’s learn the importance of video animations and when and why to use this technique.</p>

<h2 id="What-are-Video-Animation-and-its-importance"><a href="#What-are-Video-Animation-and-its-importance" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Animation and its importance?"></a>What are Video Animation and its importance?</h2><p>Video as a marketing tool has become more popular but also more important. In this article, you can read more about why media marketing is getting more essential in comparison to text marketing. Therefore, an explainer video with Animation is an amazing way to show your target audience who you are, where you stand for, what you do and how you can solve the customer’s problem.</p>
<p>Video animation is an engaging technique that can help you comprehensively tell your story. Animated meaning can be better comprehended as a simulation of motion created by showing a series of pictures. Animated videos for a business catch the viewers and make for an enjoyable story-telling experience.</p>
<p>Often, animation videos are used to explain a concept or process. It’s straightforward to make these videos appealing and likable as you can primarily create them however you want. It can take longer to get the point across when people explain how to do something. Animations not only trigger emotions but spark conversations as well.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-most-common-types-of-Animation"><a href="#What-are-most-common-types-of-Animation" class="headerlink" title="What are most common types of Animation?"></a>What are most common types of Animation?</h2><p>The purpose of this article is to take you through the complexity of the different types of animation styles and methods. It also covers the track you should take (and what that path entails) to become an animator for each of the five types.</p>
<p>This guide is not about learning how to animate. But instead, it breaks down the five types of Animation available to you and what you’ll need to start animating: best software, schools, and courses.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Graphics (Key framing)</strong>: Motion graphics focus on making dynamic and exciting presentations of moving text logos and fundamental illustrations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion graphics can be 2D and 3D, and you’ll find them everywhere in news, sporting videos, the news, and other TV productions.</li>
<li>Correct character animation is generally outside the scope of motion graphics, but many core animation principles also apply to motion graphics.</li>
<li>Creating Motion Graphics depends on the plan used since video editing software often have different user interface or settings, but the idea is the same. Motion Graphics usually involves animating texts, pictures, or video clips using keyframing that is tweened to make a smooth motion between frames.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="key frame animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Traditional Animation</strong>: This is the classic type of Animation you’re probably most well known with. In the past, animators drew characters frame by frame, and then those pictures were moved onto transparent sheets for painting. That’s where the term animation comes from.</p>
<p>They started scanning drawings into the computer for digital coloring. The important thing is that hand-drawn animators still create their animation frame by frame using the same method and concept as in those old days of paper and cels.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora"></a>How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora</h2><p>Keyframes specify the start or end of a transition in a shot. A series of keyframes can give the semblance of the movement of an object. Keyframes include parameters such as Position, Scale, Opacity, and Rotation. These values can be changed and customized to make animations using keyframing.</p>

Even learners or novices can use keyframe animation to create extraordinary videos. Plus, the keyframe templates are an added satisfaction.

<p>Step1 Launch Wondershare Filmora from your system and select New Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="launch wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Import your selected images. In this case I imported no background images to have a clear view on how key framing works.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-animation-file-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="import animation file filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag or add the image on the Timeline Panel.</p>
<p>In this case I use a dove and a cloud to demo the Motion graphics animation</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="motion graphics animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double click the image then the Animation tab will display. Here, there are available presets, either the latest or the Legacy Animation, as indicated on the display that you can use.</p>
<p>There is also a tab if you want to customize your animations which requires premium account.</p>

Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover-3"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character-3"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats.

<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat"><a href="#05Top-Cat" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat.

There’s a lot that’s bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it.

<p>These are some of the <strong>cool animated characters to draw.</strong></p>

Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.</p>

A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.</p>

                ></p>
<p>When creating a nose from the front, it’s typical to leave off many details. Even if you merely sketch its tip, it will likely provide a convincing impact. Drawing only one side of the nose is also quite frequent. Children’s mouths are extremely simple in cartoon style, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>The ears are viewed from the front; therefore, the internal holes are not visible. The circle has already established the shape of our head.</p>

So, all we need is an effortless and playful haircut to bring our boy to life. Because there is no particular method for drawing hair, you’ll have to experiment until you find the perfect look. Look for photo references on the internet! Take a look at a magazine shoot or a Google search.</p>

<p>To stay under the eyelashes, move the eye pupils up. That’s all there is to it! With just a few tweaks, we achieved the desired result. The circular form of the eyes, hair, ears, nose, chin and the circular shape of the ears are all the same! It’s that simple!</p>

You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.</p>
<h3 id="01-Smurfette-3"><a href="#01-Smurfette-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles-3"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles-3" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.</p>
<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear-3"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear-3" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.</p>
<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla-3"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla-3" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat-3"><a href="#05Top-Cat-3" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He’s wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he’s making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones’ basic Hanna-Barbera art style.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<h3 id="06Helga-G-Pataki-3"><a href="#06Helga-G-Pataki-3" class="headerlink" title="06Helga. G. Pataki"></a>06Helga. G. Pataki</h3><p>Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There’s a lot that’s bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it. Just keep an eye on her head since getting it correct, especially with her rectangle hairdo, can be a little odd.</p>
<p>These are some of the <strong>cool animated characters to draw.</strong></p>
<h2 id="Part-3-4-Best-Drawing-Exercise-for-Creating-Cartoon-Characters-3"><a href="#Part-3-4-Best-Drawing-Exercise-for-Creating-Cartoon-Characters-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 4 Best Drawing Exercise for Creating Cartoon Characters"></a>Part 3 <strong>4 Best Drawing Exercise for Creating Cartoon Characters</strong></h2><p>You’ll learn how to create cartoon characters individually, including their faces, hair, and facial expressions.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Draw-Cartoon-Characters-3"><a href="#01How-to-Draw-Cartoon-Characters-3" class="headerlink" title="01How to Draw Cartoon Characters"></a>01How to Draw Cartoon Characters</h3><p>We’ll go through the fundamentals of human perception before getting into cartoon face drawing. Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.</p>

<h3 id="02Here-you-will-learn-How-to-Draw-a-Cartoon-Face-3"><a href="#02Here-you-will-learn-How-to-Draw-a-Cartoon-Face-3" class="headerlink" title="02Here, you will learn How to Draw a Cartoon Face"></a>02Here, you will learn How to Draw a Cartoon Face</h3><p>Let us begin with a sketch of a cartoon face. A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Face"
                ></p>
<p>When creating a nose from the front, it’s typical to leave off many details. Even if you merely sketch its tip, it will likely provide a convincing impact. Drawing only one side of the nose is also quite frequent. Children’s mouths are extremely simple in cartoon style, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>The ears are viewed from the front; therefore, the internal holes are not visible. The circle has already established the shape of our head.</p>

<h3 id="03Let’s-learn-about-How-to-Draw-a-Cartoon-Hair-3"><a href="#03Let’s-learn-about-How-to-Draw-a-Cartoon-Hair-3" class="headerlink" title="03Let’s learn about How to Draw a Cartoon Hair"></a>03Let’s learn about How to Draw a Cartoon Hair</h3><p>Keep in mind that our characters’ hair is essential for identifying their personalities, and it can also indicate their age. So, all we need is an effortless and playful haircut to bring our boy to life. Because there is no particular method for drawing hair, you’ll have to experiment until you find the perfect look. Look for photo references on the internet! Take a look at a magazine shoot or a Google search.</p>

<p>To stay under the eyelashes, move the eye pupils up. That’s all there is to it! With just a few tweaks, we achieved the desired result. The circular form of the eyes, hair, ears, nose, chin and the circular shape of the ears are all the same! It’s that simple!</p>
