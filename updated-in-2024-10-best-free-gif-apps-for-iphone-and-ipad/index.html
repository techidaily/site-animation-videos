The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

An animated image (also referred to as GIF) is designed by adding motion to a still image. Remember all the funny cat memes you see on Instagram? Well, they are a great example of animated images.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to understand that the applications of animated images aren’t only limited to social media and marketing. You can even animate your family photos and add life to those 20-year old pictures you’ve been saving forever. Not to mention, you can also create animated images of your favorite superhero movie. Love the Justice League starcast? Simply pick your favorite superhero and you’ll get stunning <strong>Justice League animated</strong> images.</p>
