This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

<h3 id="02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging"><a href="#02An-Introduction-to-2D-Animation-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging"></a>02<strong>An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>
<h3 id="04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving"><a href="#04Key-3D-Rigging-Terms-to-Get-You-Moving" class="headerlink" title="04Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving"></a>04<strong>Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving</strong></h3><p>Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:</p>
<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>

This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>

<p>Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!</p>
<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>Manually make connections starting with the joints.</p>
<p>Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.</p>
<p>Motion can then be added to the timeline.</p>

<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters.

<p><strong>Joints|Bones</strong>: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.</p>
<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>

<p><strong>Driven Keys</strong>: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).</p>
<p><strong>Blend Shapes</strong>: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.</p>
<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>
<p><strong>Deformers</strong>: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.</p>
<p><strong>Skinning</strong>: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.</p>
<p><strong>Weight Planning</strong>: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.</p>
<p><strong>Facial Rigging</strong>: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.</p>

This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-2"><a href="#01How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="01How to Rig a Simple Character"></a>01<strong>How to Rig a Simple Character</strong></h3><p>This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Design Your Character</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg"
                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of <strong>animation rigging</strong> you’ll need to work on for that character.</p>
<p>For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!</p>
<p>So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design"
                ></p>
<p>When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!</p>
<p>Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Connect The Layers!</strong></p>
<p>It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Timing Your Animation</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions</p>

<p>Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.</p>
<p>If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.</p>

However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>Manually make connections starting with the joints.</p>

<p>This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of <strong>animate rigging</strong></p>
<p>To help them out (as well as other <strong>animation rigging</strong> beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!</p>

This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-3"><a href="#01What-is-Rigging-in-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="01What is Rigging in Animation"></a>01<strong>What is Rigging in Animation</strong></h3><p>Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.</p>
<p>Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription" >Maya <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in order to get this done!</p>

It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!</p>
<h3 id="03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-3"><a href="#03An-Introduction-to-3D-Animation-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging"></a>03<strong>An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging</strong></h3><p>3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.</p>
<p>In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.</p>

<p><strong>Inverse Kinematics</strong>: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.</p>
<p><strong>Forward Kinematics</strong>: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.</p>
<p><strong>Control Curves</strong>: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraint</strong>: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.</p>

It offers a full-scale editing panel and a plethora of features that allow designers to create visually enticing 3D animations for videos, games, and marketing purposes. But, can you use Blender to create 2D animations? Even though the tool is marketed as a 3D animation creator, it’s worth noting that one can use it for 2D animations as well. Now, the process may not be as straightforward as using a dedicated 2D animation creator, you can still get the job done using Blender. This will be pretty helpful if you are already a Blender user and want to create 2D animations for a project.</p>
<p>To help you along the way, we have put together a detailed guide on how to create Blender 2D animations and use them in your videos to make them look more stunning. So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="design image blender"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.</p>
<h5 id="Step-4-3"><a href="#Step-4-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course"><a href="#Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course"></a>Part 3 <strong>Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course</strong></h2><p>For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>.

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>

And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning.

But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible.

The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>

And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging-3"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3"><a href="#Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course"></a>Part 3 <strong>Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course</strong></h2><p>For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. Whether it be about <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender facial rigging</strong>, <strong>free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs</strong>, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.</p>
<h3 id="01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3"><a href="#01Where-to-Learn-the-Course-3" class="headerlink" title="01Where to Learn the Course?"></a>01<strong>Where to Learn the Course?</strong></h3><p>The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters’ <strong>blender rigging</strong> course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.</p>

We suggest the “Blender Fundamentals” course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is “Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of <strong>Blender rigging</strong> (including <strong>Blender rigging</strong> and <strong>Blender rigging</strong> videos.)</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> subjects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master’s introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender’s own “Blender Fundamental” series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you’ll need to know.)</p>
