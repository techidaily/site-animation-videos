<p><strong>Blender animation</strong> software is one of the open-source software chosen to create animations. It is easy to create animations, videos or graphics, etc. If you want to be an animation 3D artist, make creative universes, and meet each of the different characters moving around in your heart.</p>
<p>You will learn the step-by-step procedure to create animations and add other edits to the animation. And also a few tips to develop better <strong>Blender 3D animation</strong> effects.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blender-best-for-animation"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blender-best-for-animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blender best for animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blender best for animation?</strong></h2><p>The answer to if the Blender is suitable for animation is yes. <strong>Blender animation</strong> is the best for making animations and bringing any living to animator. This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.</strong></h2><p>This is a series for people who want to learn how to create <strong>3D blender animation</strong> characters from keeping a reference image. Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>

<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>

There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>

Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>

There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>

We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>

<p>We love the nickname “Red hot-blooded Habanero,” Kushina earned when she attacked a bunch of kids who teased and laughed at her. Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure. She is the wife of Minato Namikaze and the mother of Naruto Uzumaki in the top-rated Naruto series. Despite a short temper and violent outbursts, Kushina possesses a soft and caring side most people love her for.</p>

<p>Asuna Yuuki is one of the popular <strong>anime girl characters</strong> of our favorite Sword Art Online novel, manga, anime franchise. She is the deuteragonist and former Vice-commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath in Sword Art Online. Early on, Asuna was shown to be a strong fighter who did not care about dying until she met Kirito. However, Asuna is a bit overly serious, and as the SAO series progresses, she is shown nothing but the wife of Kirito.</p>

<p>School’s number one beauty, the red-haired Rias Gremory, deserves a spot on our list. She is the only daughter of Zeoticus Venelana Gremory and the next head of the Gremory clan. We love when she is called the Crimson-haired Ruin Princess. While she has charming features, she is very kind and compassionate even to her servants – something which makes her a fan favorite,</p>

                ></p>
<p>Out of the many unique anime characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara Kugosaki is a tough girl most anime fans are drawn to. She is one of the Jujutsu manga’s three primary protagonists who moved to Tokyo. Nobara isn’t your typical strong lady; she is confident and outspoken about her appearance and herself as a person.</p>
<p>As a rebellious fighter, she has shown superhuman pain tolerance while fighting foes even larger than herself. Nobara fans love her proficiency with various curse-infused weaponry, such as the hammer and nail, straw dolls, and the rubber mallet.</p>

                ></p>
<p>As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best <strong>anime girl characters.</strong> The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Once a cheerful, outgoing, and innocent child living with her parents, Mikasa grows up to be quite stoic and dangerous at times. Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent’s brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body? Motoko Kusanagi is employed as an officer for Public Security Section 9, a Japanese National Public Safety Commission division. After the airplane accident in her childhood, Motoko was comatose until her consciousness was put into a prosthetic body. Since then, she has been an excellent hacker with incredible intelligence and combat skills respected among her colleagues. Motoko connects with the audience on a greater level, for she is strong, cool, intellectual, and artificial at the same time.</p>

<p>Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki. Being a rugged, know-it-all kind of girl but with a touch of kindness, people adore Touka Kirishima.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as “Courtesan of Death.” She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Lucy Heartfilia, an iconic anime girl from the Fairy Tail manga series, has the best character growth from the first episode to the last. When we first see her, she is a happy, innocent little girl who grows up to be a divine spirit mage and mother to seven children.</p>
<p>There are so many likable qualities about Lucy – she is fair and beautiful, responsible, with impressive magic skills, and a desire to become a world-famous author. Lucy Heartfilia leaves her home after her mother’s death with an ambition for independence, something admired by the fandom.</p>

                      alt="yui komori"
                ></p>
<p>Yui is living with Cordelia’s heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.</p>
<p>When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it’s not a surprise that Diabolik Lover’s Yui Komori is everyone’s favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there’s more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.</p>

                ></p>
<p>No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can’t really relate to this complex <strong>female anime character</strong> until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it’s hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath’s spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General’s apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father’s death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.</p>

<p>Tall, beautiful, and a bit scary, Erza Scarlet is an S-class mage of the Fairy Tail Guild. As one of the leading female protagonists in Team Natsu, Erza feels great pride and shows dedication to the guild. She’s often seen in her custom-made armored suit, a blue skirt, and black boots with a blue Fairy Tail stamp on her upper left arm. But, changing her attire at any given time is never a problem for her, thanks to her Requip magic powers.</p>

Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure. She is the wife of Minato Namikaze and the mother of Naruto Uzumaki in the top-rated Naruto series.

<p>Out of the many unique anime characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara Kugosaki is a tough girl most anime fans are drawn to. She is one of the Jujutsu manga’s three primary protagonists who moved to Tokyo. Nobara isn’t your typical strong lady; she is confident and outspoken about her appearance and herself as a person.</p>
<p>As a rebellious fighter, she has shown superhuman pain tolerance while fighting foes even larger than herself. Nobara fans love her proficiency with various curse-infused weaponry, such as the hammer and nail, straw dolls, and the rubber mallet.</p>

<p>As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best <strong>anime girl characters.</strong> The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Once a cheerful, outgoing, and innocent child living with her parents, Mikasa grows up to be quite stoic and dangerous at times. Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent’s brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body? Motoko Kusanagi is employed as an officer for Public Security Section 9, a Japanese National Public Safety Commission division. After the airplane accident in her childhood, Motoko was comatose until her consciousness was put into a prosthetic body. Since then, she has been an excellent hacker with incredible intelligence and combat skills respected among her colleagues. Motoko connects with the audience on a greater level, for she is strong, cool, intellectual, and artificial at the same time.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki. Being a rugged, know-it-all kind of girl but with a touch of kindness, people adore Touka Kirishima.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as “Courtesan of Death.” She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Lucy Heartfilia, an iconic anime girl from the Fairy Tail manga series, has the best character growth from the first episode to the last. When we first see her, she is a happy, innocent little girl who grows up to be a divine spirit mage and mother to seven children.</p>
<p>There are so many likable qualities about Lucy – she is fair and beautiful, responsible, with impressive magic skills, and a desire to become a world-famous author. Lucy Heartfilia leaves her home after her mother’s death with an ambition for independence, something admired by the fandom.</p>

                      alt="yui komori"
                ></p>
<p>Yui is living with Cordelia’s heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.</p>
<p>When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it’s not a surprise that Diabolik Lover’s Yui Komori is everyone’s favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there’s more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.</p>

                ></p>
<p>No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can’t really relate to this complex <strong>female anime character</strong> until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it’s hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath’s spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General’s apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father’s death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.</p>

<p>Tall, beautiful, and a bit scary, Erza Scarlet is an S-class mage of the Fairy Tail Guild. As one of the leading female protagonists in Team Natsu, Erza feels great pride and shows dedication to the guild. She’s often seen in her custom-made armored suit, a blue skirt, and black boots with a blue Fairy Tail stamp on her upper left arm. But, changing her attire at any given time is never a problem for her, thanks to her Requip magic powers.</p>
<p>Anime fans love Erza for her strict yet clumsy personality. Her fighting and leadership skills in the war against Phantom Lord Guild have had fans in admiration.</p>

<p>We love the nickname “Red hot-blooded Habanero,” Kushina earned when she attacked a bunch of kids who teased and laughed at her. Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure. She is the wife of Minato Namikaze and the mother of Naruto Uzumaki in the top-rated Naruto series. Despite a short temper and violent outbursts, Kushina possesses a soft and caring side most people love her for.</p>

<p>Asuna Yuuki is one of the popular <strong>anime girl characters</strong> of our favorite Sword Art Online novel, manga, anime franchise. She is the deuteragonist and former Vice-commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath in Sword Art Online. Early on, Asuna was shown to be a strong fighter who did not care about dying until she met Kirito. However, Asuna is a bit overly serious, and as the SAO series progresses, she is shown nothing but the wife of Kirito.</p>

<p>School’s number one beauty, the red-haired Rias Gremory, deserves a spot on our list. She is the only daughter of Zeoticus Venelana Gremory and the next head of the Gremory clan. We love when she is called the Crimson-haired Ruin Princess. While she has charming features, she is very kind and compassionate even to her servants – something which makes her a fan favorite,</p>

<p>Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki. Being a rugged, know-it-all kind of girl but with a touch of kindness, people adore Touka Kirishima.</p>

<p>Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as “Courtesan of Death.” She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.</p>

<p>Lucy Heartfilia, an iconic anime girl from the Fairy Tail manga series, has the best character growth from the first episode to the last. When we first see her, she is a happy, innocent little girl who grows up to be a divine spirit mage and mother to seven children.</p>
<p>There are so many likable qualities about Lucy – she is fair and beautiful, responsible, with impressive magic skills, and a desire to become a world-famous author. Lucy Heartfilia leaves her home after her mother’s death with an ambition for independence, something admired by the fandom.</p>

<p>Yui is living with Cordelia’s heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.</p>
<p>When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it’s not a surprise that Diabolik Lover’s Yui Komori is everyone’s favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there’s more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.</p>

                ></p>
<p>No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can’t really relate to this complex <strong>female anime character</strong> until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it’s hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath’s spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General’s apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father’s death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Tall, beautiful, and a bit scary, Erza Scarlet is an S-class mage of the Fairy Tail Guild. As one of the leading female protagonists in Team Natsu, Erza feels great pride and shows dedication to the guild. She’s often seen in her custom-made armored suit, a blue skirt, and black boots with a blue Fairy Tail stamp on her upper left arm. But, changing her attire at any given time is never a problem for her, thanks to her Requip magic powers.</p>
<p>Anime fans love Erza for her strict yet clumsy personality. Her fighting and leadership skills in the war against Phantom Lord Guild have had fans in admiration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>We love the nickname “Red hot-blooded Habanero,” Kushina earned when she attacked a bunch of kids who teased and laughed at her. Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure. She is the wife of Minato Namikaze and the mother of Naruto Uzumaki in the top-rated Naruto series. Despite a short temper and violent outbursts, Kushina possesses a soft and caring side most people love her for.</p>

<p>Asuna Yuuki is one of the popular <strong>anime girl characters</strong> of our favorite Sword Art Online novel, manga, anime franchise. She is the deuteragonist and former Vice-commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath in Sword Art Online. Early on, Asuna was shown to be a strong fighter who did not care about dying until she met Kirito. However, Asuna is a bit overly serious, and as the SAO series progresses, she is shown nothing but the wife of Kirito.</p>

                ></p>
<p>School’s number one beauty, the red-haired Rias Gremory, deserves a spot on our list. She is the only daughter of Zeoticus Venelana Gremory and the next head of the Gremory clan. We love when she is called the Crimson-haired Ruin Princess. While she has charming features, she is very kind and compassionate even to her servants – something which makes her a fan favorite,</p>

                ></p>
<p>Out of the many unique anime characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara Kugosaki is a tough girl most anime fans are drawn to. She is one of the Jujutsu manga’s three primary protagonists who moved to Tokyo. Nobara isn’t your typical strong lady; she is confident and outspoken about her appearance and herself as a person.</p>
<p>As a rebellious fighter, she has shown superhuman pain tolerance while fighting foes even larger than herself. Nobara fans love her proficiency with various curse-infused weaponry, such as the hammer and nail, straw dolls, and the rubber mallet.</p>

                ></p>
<p>As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best <strong>anime girl characters.</strong> The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Once a cheerful, outgoing, and innocent child living with her parents, Mikasa grows up to be quite stoic and dangerous at times. Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent’s brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.</p>

<p>Who doesn’t know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body? Motoko Kusanagi is employed as an officer for Public Security Section 9, a Japanese National Public Safety Commission division. After the airplane accident in her childhood, Motoko was comatose until her consciousness was put into a prosthetic body. Since then, she has been an excellent hacker with incredible intelligence and combat skills respected among her colleagues. Motoko connects with the audience on a greater level, for she is strong, cool, intellectual, and artificial at the same time.</p>

<p>Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.</p>
<p>In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation.

<p>Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as “Courtesan of Death.” She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.</p>

Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there’s more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.</p>
<h3 id="13-Revy-Black-Lagoon-3"><a href="#13-Revy-Black-Lagoon-3" class="headerlink" title="13. Revy-Black Lagoon"></a>13. Revy-Black Lagoon</h3><p><img

                      alt="revy anime character"
                ></p>
<p>No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can’t really relate to this complex <strong>female anime character</strong> until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.</p>
<h3 id="14-Shoko-Nishimiya-A-Silent-Voice-3"><a href="#14-Shoko-Nishimiya-A-Silent-Voice-3" class="headerlink" title="14. Shoko Nishimiya- A Silent Voice"></a>14. Shoko Nishimiya- A Silent Voice</h3><p><img

                      alt="shoko nishimiya"
                ></p>
<p>This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it’s hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.</p>

                      alt="esdeath female anime-character"
                ></p>
<p>Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath’s spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General’s apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father’s death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.</p>

While some of these turn out lovable gems, others prove long-forgotten failures. But what is it about an anime character that makes it stand out?</p>
<p>Everything shapes the perfect leading anime character, from their personalities to their clothes and styling to the character development.

<p>Along with renaming the tool, the evolution from Flash to Adobe Animate CC has added a wide range of advanced functionalities like support to WebGL and HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p>You will not regret your decision after reading this article and will find that using Adobe Animate CC is a wise choice. Hence, let’s begin to get enlightened on the features.</p>
<h2 id="New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC"><a href="#New-features-of-Adobe-Animate-CC" class="headerlink" title="New features of Adobe Animate CC"></a>New features of Adobe Animate CC</h2><h4 id="1-Adobe-Animate-Camera"><a href="#1-Adobe-Animate-Camera" class="headerlink" title="1. Adobe Animate Camera"></a>1. Adobe Animate Camera</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC introduces virtual camera functionality unlike other <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of this feature, you can easily stimulate your camera’s movement giving your animation a more realistic view.</p>
<p>Making it simpler, you can effortlessly execute panning, zooming and rotating to your animations if you wish. Using the virtual camera in Animate CC, you will be enabling to add more dramatic effects while creating an animation.</p>
<p>For instance, if there’s a fighting scene in our animated movie, you can rotate at the moment the scene shows destruction to give it a dramatic effect or you can zoom in or out and change the viewer’s attention from one point to the other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-camera.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc camera"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Export-format"><a href="#2-Export-format" class="headerlink" title="2. Export format"></a>2. Export format</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC has adapted the web standards for the exporting your animation which makes it easier for everyone to view it from desktop to mobile device.</p>
<p>This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.</p>
<p>Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-export-format.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc export format"
                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Vector-brushes"><a href="#3-Vector-brushes" class="headerlink" title="3. Vector brushes"></a>3. Vector brushes</h4><p>Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.</p>
<p>This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animate cc vector brush"
                ></p>
<h4 id="4-Audio-Syncing"><a href="#4-Audio-Syncing" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Syncing"></a>4. Audio Syncing</h4><p>The timeline feature of the tool will now allow the users to sync audios in their animations and this is a yet another feature that Animate CC has added. This means you can do audio synchronization for your animation series.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-audio-syncing.JPG"
                      alt="animate cc audio syncing"
                ></p>
<p>Nevertheless, doing this can be a little demanding as well as time-consuming with HTML5 alone. In addition, you also get enabled for audio loop control with the Adobe Animate CC’s timeline feature.</p>
<h4 id="5-Font"><a href="#5-Font" class="headerlink" title="5. Font"></a>5. Font</h4><p>Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts. These web fonts will be present for HTML5 canvas documents in the tool. Users can pick out from thousands of high-quality fonts via a subscription plan.</p>
<p>Putting in different words, first you can try some selected fonts available in the Typekit library via any level of Creative Cloud plan. Then when you subscribe by spending some money, you can then get access to complete Typekit library where there are thousands of premium fonts for HTML5 canvas.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animate cc font"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p>Animation industry is no doubt a very interesting one and having the best tool can make it more interesting and fun. After making you familiarize with the top functionalities that are coming with Adobe Animate CC, we feel it would be fair to end the discussion here. Hope you will not give a second thought on Animate CC when need to do flash animation.</p>
<p>Before ending, one more thing that we would like to give the other thought by introducing you Filmora.</p>
<p>No, this is a not another feature, but an interesting yet powerful video editing software created by Wondershare, one of the leading brand in multimedia field. You can use this tool and get your animated videos edited using its extraordinary effects.</p>

After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated-3"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

<h3 id="03Step-3-Draw-Characters-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Draw-Characters-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Draw Characters"></a>03<strong>Step 3. Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

<p> We all love GIFs and their impressive style of delivering stories. They not only contain set of frames rather they wrap inside lots of emotions and thoughts of creators. You can easily find numbers of eye catching GIF collections over social media sites.</p>
<p> If you love these animated images then probably you might have initiated a search over internet about how to create GIFs. And search engine must have shown you a path to unlimited <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GIF creator tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. That’s common. But here we are going to talk about one professional recommendation for GIF creation. Yeah, it is Photoshop and it can instantly generate appealing animated Gifs for you.</p>
<p> Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-a-GIF-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-to-make-a-GIF-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How to make a GIF in Photoshop"></a>How to make a GIF in Photoshop</h2><ul>
<li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</a></li>
<li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Method-1-Make-a-GIF-from-Video-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop"></a>Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Launch-your-software"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-your-software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch your software"></a>Step 1: Launch your software</h4><p> Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported"><a href="#Step-2-Get-your-video-clip-imported" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Get your video clip imported"></a>Step 2: Get your video clip imported</h4><p> As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.</p>
<h4 id="Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings"></a>Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.</p>
<p> It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:</p>
<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.</p>
<p><strong>Dither:</strong> The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.</p>
<p><strong>Lossy:</strong> If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file"><a href="#Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file"></a>Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file</h4><p> When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose “Save for Web” option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.</p>

<h3 id="Method-2-Make-a-GIF-from-Still-Photos-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Method-2-Make-a-GIF-from-Still-Photos-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop"></a>Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop</h3><p> It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop’s animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:</p>
<h4 id="1-Step-1"><a href="#1-Step-1" class="headerlink" title="1.  Step 1"></a>1.  Step 1</h4><p> First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts. It will provide you an option for Load Files into Stack. Now hit browse button and choose your images from desktop folder that you further want to use for development of GIF image. Hit OK. It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.</p>
<p> Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.</p>
<p> All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File &gt; New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.</p>
<p> Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have “Load Files into Stack” feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Step-2"><a href="#2-Step-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Step 2"></a>2.  Step 2</h4><p> Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.</p>
<p> As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose “Make Frames from Layer” option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.</p>
<h4 id="3-Step-3"><a href="#3-Step-3" class="headerlink" title="3.  Step 3"></a>3.  Step 3</h4><p> Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings-1"><a href="#Step-3-Adjust-file-Import-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings"></a>Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.</p>
<p> It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:</p>
<p><strong>Colors:</strong> Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.</p>
<p><strong>Dither:</strong> The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.</p>
<p><strong>Lossy:</strong> If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.</p>
<p><strong>Size:</strong> Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.</p>
<h4 id="Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file-1"><a href="#Step-4-Time-to-Save-your-GIF-file-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file"></a>Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file</h4><p> When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose “Save for Web” option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.</p>

<p> Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have “Load Files into Stack” feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.</p>
<h4 id="2-Step-2-1"><a href="#2-Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="2.  Step 2"></a>2.  Step 2</h4><p> Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.</p>
<p> As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose “Make Frames from Layer” option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.</p>
<h4 id="3-Step-3-1"><a href="#3-Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="3.  Step 3"></a>3.  Step 3</h4><p> Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable.
