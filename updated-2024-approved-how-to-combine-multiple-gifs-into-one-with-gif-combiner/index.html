Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-gifs.jpg"
                      alt="preview gifs GIF combining maker"
                ></p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>

Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import GIFs to combine</p>
<p>First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Save GIF with name</p>
<p>Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg"
                      alt="GIF combiner file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy frames</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Change image settings</p>
<p>After finalizing the best preview for your edited files, you can hit the file menu option and then save your project for device or web option. It will immediately open a dialogue box where users can easily specify their image quality and loop count details. Never forget to have one more preview before saving the final results.</p>

                      alt="looping counts to combine"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Save your project</p>
<p>As now you are done with all the editing tasks so it is time to hit the “Save” option and then provide your destination address to the modified file. Your animated GIF file is now ready to get uploaded on the internet.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg"
                      alt="copy frames in GIF combiner"
                ></p>
<p>Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Paste your copy</p>
<p>It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy and paste</p>
<p>Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make separation</p>
<p>To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.</p>

<p>Our list of the top 8 beats places to download <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>. You may get a lot of <strong>GIF libraries free</strong> by visiting these websites. These websites allow animated GIFs for various purposes, including personal, educational, and commercial ones. You can use the GIFs you download on your websites, blogs, presentations, and emails, among other things. The most excellent part about most of these websites is that you don’t have to pay anything or give them credit in exchange for royalty-free GIFs. These websites include trendy and attractive GIFs, while others only have older royalty-free GIFs. The GIFs on these websites are similarly free of any watermark.</p>
<p>There are numerous websites to download <strong>royalty GIFs</strong> with stock sound effects and photographs. However, when it comes to <strong>copyright-free GIFs</strong>, only a few websites offer them up for download. So, after spending a much time on the internet, I’ve found five websites that can assist you in doing the same. Two of the websites, “Best Animations” and “Animate It,” only enable you to use the GIFs you download for personal use.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-GIFs-Royalty-Free-2"><a href="#Part-1-Is-GIFs-Royalty-Free-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?"></a>Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?</h2><p>There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies’ use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.</p>
<p>The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, “Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are “stolen” from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)</p>

However, when it comes to <strong>copyright-free GIFs</strong>, only a few websites offer them up for download. So, after spending a much time on the internet, I’ve found five websites that can assist you in doing the same. Two of the websites, “Best Animations” and “Animate It,” only enable you to use the GIFs you download for personal use.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-GIFs-Royalty-Free-3"><a href="#Part-1-Is-GIFs-Royalty-Free-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?"></a>Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?</h2><p>There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies’ use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.</p>
<p>The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for <strong>royalty-free GIFs</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, “Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are “stolen” from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use-3"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIFs-on-Giphy-Free-to-Use-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?</strong></h2><p>All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not <strong>copyright-free GIFs.</strong> However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.

<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>

<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>

Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>

This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>

                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>

<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-1"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-1" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>
<p>This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.</p>

<p>It will be beneficial while knowing <strong>how to make 2D animation for games</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements-2"><a href="#01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements-2" class="headerlink" title="01Focus on the story and start with simple movements"></a>01Focus on the story and start with simple movements</h3><p>You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don’t miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.</p>
<h3 id="02Use-keyframes-properly-2"><a href="#02Use-keyframes-properly-2" class="headerlink" title="02Use keyframes properly"></a>02Use keyframes properly</h3><p>You need to carefully use keyframes’ start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements.

Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.</p>
<p>Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical <strong>2D</strong> <strong>game animation</strong> strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-2"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"

<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-2"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-2" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>

<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>

Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>

<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-3"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-3" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>
<p>This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.</p>
