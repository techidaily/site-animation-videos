<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-Adobe-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-Adobe-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?</strong></h2><p>Alright, so what is the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong> and how does it differ from <strong>Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging</strong> or <strong>Adobe After Effects Rigging</strong>? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX"><a href="#05IKMAX" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in introducing animations into your content but you don’t have the time or the patience to get too involved with <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-2"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-2"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-2"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-2" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro-2"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-2"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-2" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-2"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-2" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX-2"><a href="#05IKMAX-2" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

<p><strong>Architecture Animation</strong> is the practice of creating a 3D Animation of a structure. A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.</p>

These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.</p>
<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.</p>
<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

<h3 id="01Detailed-Construction-Requirements-2"><a href="#01Detailed-Construction-Requirements-2" class="headerlink" title="01Detailed Construction Requirements"></a>01<strong>Detailed Construction Requirements</strong></h3><p>As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong>. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.</p>

<h3 id="01VisEngine-2"><a href="#01VisEngine-2" class="headerlink" title="01VisEngine"></a>01<strong>VisEngine</strong></h3><p>The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is “VisEngine.” They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you’re curious as to the look of their finished <strong>architectural animations</strong>, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out</p>
<h3 id="02Exodo-Animation-Studios-2"><a href="#02Exodo-Animation-Studios-2" class="headerlink" title="02Exodo Animation Studios"></a>02<strong>Exodo Animation Studios</strong></h3><p>“Exodo Animation Studios” is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They’ve had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI</p>
<h3 id="03Promoshin-2"><a href="#03Promoshin-2" class="headerlink" title="03Promoshin"></a>03<strong>Promoshin</strong></h3><p>Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn’t mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they’ve worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)</p>
<h3 id="04ZOA-Studio-2"><a href="#04ZOA-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="04ZOA Studio"></a>04<strong>ZOA Studio</strong></h3><p>ZOA Studio brings us back to <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it’s a great resource for those looking for inspiration)</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.</strong></h2><p>This is a series for people who want to learn how to create <strong>3D blender animation</strong> characters from keeping a reference image. Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>

Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>

We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
