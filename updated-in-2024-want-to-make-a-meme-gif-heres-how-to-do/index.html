<p>But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you’re looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms</p>

No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you’re using and your initial picture For the former, it’s best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it’s best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome</p>

These occur often with GIF makers that support transparency If you find these happening to you, adjust the transparency settings to get rid of the white pixel outline around your converted GIF.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 1: Go to Loading.IO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that’s as easy as opening the link that we’ve provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Photo to Turn into GIF"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Slider Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

<h3 id="02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-1"><a href="#02How-to-Make-an-Animated-GIF-in-Photoshop-Tutorial-1" class="headerlink" title="02How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]"></a>02<strong>How to Make an Animated GIF in Photoshop [Tutorial]</strong></h3><p>For the next tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to use Photoshop to create and edit an animated GIF This process is fairly lengthy and is not recommended for beginners. But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>

                      alt="Choose GIF Animation Style"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Adjust Settings</strong></p>
<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download as GIF</strong></p>
<p>To wrap things up, it’s time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to ‘Download As: GIF’</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png"
                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Photo</strong></p>
<p>Once on-site, it’s time to upload the photo that you want to turn into a GIF As this is an icon creator, you should pick a photo with the proper parameters</p>
<p>To upload your icon for animating, select the ‘Upload’ button and browse your computer or your Google Drive for the image in question.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Choose animation Style</strong></p>
<p>Next, choose how you want the uploaded photo to be animated Loading.IO offers a couple of animations that you can choose from Including the ‘beat’ animation, which is what we choose for our example</p>

<p>This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome</p>
<p>For example, you can speed up the animation with the ‘Speed’ slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the ‘Repeat’ slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result</p>

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack</strong></p>
<p>First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop ‘Image Stack’. This can be done by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Scripts &gt; Load Files into Stack…’ option</p>
<p>Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click ‘OK’ when done</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Images into Image Stack"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Organize Layers</strong></p>
<p>Check the ‘Layers’ panel for the images that you uploaded and organize them based on how you want them to appear for your animated GIF</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif7.png"
                      alt="Organize Layers Panel"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: (Optional) Import Video</strong></p>
<p>If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the ‘File’ tab and clicking on the ‘Import &gt; Video Frames to Layers…’ option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2</p>
<p>Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Import Video Frames to Layers"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Open Timeline Then Create Frame Animation</strong></p>
<p>Next, in order to start working on your animation, open the Timeline Window This can be done by clicking the ‘Window’ tab and selecting ‘Timeline’</p>
<p>With the ‘Timeline’ Window now open, select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ option to begin working</p>

                      alt="Create Frame Animation on Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Make Frame from Layers</strong></p>
<p>In order to transfer your uploaded images from the ‘Layers’ panel to your timeline, select the ‘Menu’ option on the top-right hand corner of the ‘Timeline’ window and select the ‘Make Frames From Layers’ option</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Make Frames from Layers Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: Preview Animation and Adjust as Needed</strong></p>
<p>To preview your animation, click the ‘Play’ button This is the best time to check that your frames have been organized correctly If they are not, you can adjust them by dragging and dropping them on the timeline.</p>
<p>OR, you can use the ‘Reverse Frames’ option if your animation has been completely flipped around</p>

                      alt="Preview and Adjust Animation Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Create an Animation Loop</strong></p>
<p>In order to be a proper looped GIF, the animation should repeat endlessly You can make sure of this by changing the ‘Repeat’ option to ‘Forever’ (as is shown in the image below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Loop Animation Forever"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 8: Export Finished Animation to Gif</strong></p>
<p>In order to finish turning your <strong>image into GIF</strong>, you’ll need to export it in the proper format This is possible by selecting the ‘File’ tab and then clicking the ‘Export &gt; Save for Web (Legacy)…’ option</p>
<p>A pop-up window should appear where you can control export settings Do so in order to ensure that you have the best outcome</p>

<p>For our last tutorial, we’ll be showing you how to make an animated GIF with the use of Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. Filmora is a video editor, one that is used by professionals all over to produce high-quality content And, of course, as a video editor, it works just as well as a GIF maker. One that you can use to create images into a GIF easily</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Filmora</strong></p>
<p>First, download and install Filmora If you want to follow along with this demonstration, you can Wondershare offers a FREE trial where you can test out all of the software’s functions before making a commitment</p>

                      alt="Download and Install Wondershare&#39;s Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video to Turn into GIF</strong></p>
<p>For this next step, we do something akin to what we did earlier with Photoshop. And that is to upload images or a video to fit into a timeline</p>
<p>This process is started by first uploading images, which you can do by clicking the ‘File’ tab and selecting the ‘Import Media &gt; Import Media Files’ option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif15.png"
                      alt="Import Media Files on Filmora"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Drag Media to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>With   <strong>Filmora, the ‘Timeline’ window is already open Also, you won’t have to do anything complicated to get your media onto the said timeline. Just drag and drop it from the Media library (as is shown in the image below).</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Drag-and-Drop Media to Filmora Timeline"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF</strong></p>
<p>Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment</p>
<p>For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the ‘Trim’ option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Trim Uploaded Video"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Export into GIF</strong></p>
<p>Finally, to finish us off, we export our finished GIF This can be done by selecting the ‘Export’ tab and then clicking the ‘Create Video’ option A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust export settings</p>
<p><img

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>
<p>Blender’s animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-3D-Animated-Characters-with-Blender-in-15-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.</strong></h2><p>This is a series for people who want to learn how to create <strong>3D blender animation</strong> characters from keeping a reference image. Blender’s ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Add-Keyframes"><a href="#02Step-2-Add-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Add Keyframes"></a>02Step 2: Add Keyframes</h3><p>There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.</p>
<p>Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet ‘G’ on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.</p>
<p>Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials"><a href="#03Step-3-Get-Reference-Materials" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Get Reference Materials"></a>03Step 3: Get Reference Materials</h3><p>It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let’s discuss how to add it.</p>
<p>Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select “Image” and then choose the “Background.” Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.</p>
<p>Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound"><a href="#04Step-4-Fine–Tuning-and-Sound" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound"></a>04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound</h3><p>This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let’s see how to add it.</p>
<p>Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.</p>
<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let’s talk about why <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong> is the best and more helpful.</p>
<p>Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.</p>
<p>There are many animation effects other than animating characters. <strong>Blender 3D for free</strong> has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.</p>

<h3 id="01Step-1-Importing-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Importing-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Importing"></a>01Step 1: Importing</h3><p>Initially, import a <strong>Blender 3D</strong> <strong>animation</strong> character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.</p>
<p>Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0</p>
<p>Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.</p>

<p>There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.</p>
<p>Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let’s discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.</p>
<p>Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the “Sound.” Now select the sound that you wish to add.</p>
<p>Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between “No Sync” to “AV Sync” in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Rendering-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Rendering"></a>05Step 5: Rendering</h3><p>Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.</p>
<p>Initially, click on “scene” and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as “WebM” and video Codec as “WEBM&#x2F;VP9. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to “Vorbis.” Choose output quality and speed.</p>
<p>After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select “Render Animation” in <strong>Blender Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using <strong>Blender 3D animation software</strong>. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the <strong>Blender 3D mouse</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2. Create a Storyboard"></a>02<strong>Step 2. Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

<h3 id="03Step-3-Draw-Characters"><a href="#03Step-3-Draw-Characters" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Draw Characters"></a>03<strong>Step 3. Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

Put Together Project</strong></h3><p>Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That’s also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go</p>
<p>In the image below, we’re only showing the start of a potential project. We’ve only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video</p>

Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more. Be warned, it’s not the kind of project you should go into if you’re not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Still, there’s something satisfying about a well-done <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1.

Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand.

This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<h3 id="05Express-Animate"><a href="#05Express-Animate" class="headerlink" title="05Express Animate"></a>05Express Animate</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $60 (full license)</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<h3 id="06Motion"><a href="#06Motion" class="headerlink" title="06Motion"></a>06Motion</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $47</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<h3 id="08Easy-Banner"><a href="#08Easy-Banner" class="headerlink" title="08Easy Banner"></a>08Easy Banner</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> FREE</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<h3 id="09Falco-GIF-Animator"><a href="#09Falco-GIF-Animator" class="headerlink" title="09Falco GIF Animator"></a>09Falco GIF Animator</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> FREE</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3&#x2F;5</p>
<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)</p>

<p>Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you’ll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.</p>

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.</p>

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

This is a general list of <strong>text animation software</strong> that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online <strong>text animation maker</strong> list, that would be the one after this!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<h3 id="05Express-Animate-1"><a href="#05Express-Animate-1" class="headerlink" title="05Express Animate"></a>05Express Animate</h3><p><strong>PRICE:</strong> $60 (full license)</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

<p>MotionDen is a good entry point for <strong>text animation online</strong> solutions!

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too!

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.</p>

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE! So, if the project you’re working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!</p>

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.</p>

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first <strong>animated text generator</strong> on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we’re focusing on today is their 3D Text &amp; Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4.9&#x2F;5</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a more modern <strong>text animation maker</strong>, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It’s also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it’s the one for you.</p>

<p>OpenToonz is a free <strong>text animation software</strong> that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)</p>

<p>Reallusion is another open-source <strong>text gif maker</strong> that you can use if you’re looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you’re willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you’re interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.</p>

<p>Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.</p>

<p>Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating.

<p>Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It’s only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that’s what you’re looking for? Then there’s no reason not to try it out! Especially since it’s free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.</p>

<p><strong>RATING:</strong> 3.5&#x2F;5</p>
<p>Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It’s also FREE!

<p>TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It’s an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire.

MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library).

<p>Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it’s also the first completely FREE <strong>online gif maker</strong> on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won’t actually move. So, if that’s not what you’re looking for? Then it might not be for you.</p>

<p>SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you’re looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It’s pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.</p>

<p>Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you’re looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you’ll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.</p>

<p>As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an <strong>animated text generator</strong>. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you’re working on.</p>

<p>For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It’s also a freemium one, so you’ll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it’s a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.</p>

As you can see, we inserted <strong>text in motion</strong> at the very start.

<p>This is the kind of project that you can do yourself with the right templates and the right video editor. We’ve got your back on the first in the list coming up. And, as for the second, we recommend that you try out Filmora! It is, as you can see, quite an expansive software. One that will allow you to truly make the most of the <strong>text motion graphics</strong> you’ll be able to create at the end of this article.</p>

We’ve tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!</p>
<h3 id="01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="01Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal’ by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you’re confused, it’s a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.</p>
<p>Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.</p>
<h3 id="02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title"><a href="#02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title" class="headerlink" title="02Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title"></a>02<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title</strong></a></h3><p>The next <strong>text motion</strong> template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title’ also created by Mogrt. This one is <strong>text motion graphics</strong> that you can use for <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It’s a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!</p>
<p>As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as <strong>text motion</strong> for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt" >after effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is available for that as well!</p>

As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that’s just starting out and doesn’t want anything too complicated.</p>
<h3 id="0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt"><a href="#0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="0430 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt"></a>04<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?_ga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets’ by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It’s also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it’s not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch’ effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn’t make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!</p>
<p>The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT"><a href="#05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT" class="headerlink" title="05Comic Bubbles MOGRT"></a>05<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?_ga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Comic Bubbles MOGRT</strong></a></h3><p>Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles’, kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that’s the kind of look that you’re looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic’ text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy’ text in between animated projects.</p>
<p>For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we’ve linked if you want to see it in action!)</p>
<h3 id="06Smoke-To-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#06Smoke-To-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="06Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>06<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?_ga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal’ is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the <strong>text motion graphics</strong> are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It’s perfect for those looking for underwater-themed <strong>text motion graphics</strong>. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.</p>
<p>This is <strong>Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro</strong>. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.</p>
<h3 id="07Text-Messages-Toolkit"><a href="#07Text-Messages-Toolkit" class="headerlink" title="07Text Messages Toolkit"></a>07<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?_ga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Text Messages Toolkit</strong></a></h3><p>Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit’ might be a fun <strong>text motion graphics</strong> for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it’s a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message’ interactions. It’s customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that’s what you want.</p>
<h3 id="08Large-Text-Title-Block"><a href="#08Large-Text-Title-Block" class="headerlink" title="08Large Text Title Block"></a>08<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/"><strong>Large Text Title Block</strong></a></h3><p>With the ‘large text title block’ template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you’re wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!</p>
<h3 id="09Blueprint-Titles"><a href="#09Blueprint-Titles" class="headerlink" title="09Blueprint Titles"></a>09<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?_ga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Blueprint Titles</strong></a></h3><p>Want something that’s a little quirkier? Or, perhaps, instructional? Then the ‘Blueprint Titles’ template is one that you can consider. As you can perhaps guess from the name, it allows you to create <strong>text motion graphics</strong> in a style that is similar to the kind of blueprints you usually see when working with design or architecture.</p>
<h3 id="10Dynamic-Minimalism"><a href="#10Dynamic-Minimalism" class="headerlink" title="10Dynamic Minimalism"></a>10<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://videohive.net/item/dynamic-minimalism-essential-graphics-mogrt/21637324?s_rank=16&_ga=2.111208772.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Dynamic Minimalism</strong></a></h3><p>Sometimes, simple really is best! And, this next template, the ‘Dynamic Minimalism’ <strong>text motion after effects</strong> and <strong>text motion graphics premiere pro</strong> template is one that you might want in your arsenal just for the sake of your simpler projects! The kit comes with 30 different animations, as well as other customization functions that you can play around with to add a little personality to what are otherwise very minimalistic designs.</p>
