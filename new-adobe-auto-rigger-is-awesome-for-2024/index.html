<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-Adobe-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-Adobe-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What’s Adobe Auto Rigger?</strong></h2><p>Alright, so what is the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong> and how does it differ from <strong>Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging</strong> or <strong>Adobe After Effects Rigging</strong>? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.</p>
<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="02-Optional-Browse-for-Downloadable-Characters"><a href="#02-Optional-Browse-for-Downloadable-Characters" class="headerlink" title="02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters"></a>02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters</h3><p>The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<h3 id="03Rig-a-Custom-Character"><a href="#03Rig-a-Custom-Character" class="headerlink" title="03Rig a Custom Character"></a>03Rig a Custom Character</h3><p>If you’ve decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong> (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX"><a href="#05IKMAX" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in introducing animations into your content but you don’t have the time or the patience to get too involved with <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>It’s all thanks to the third-party tool, <strong>Mixamo</strong>, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually <strong>rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects</strong>.) We’ll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you’re intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)</p>

Here, we make use of the <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> by making use of Mixamo’s auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.</p>
<h3 id="01Upload-Your-Own-Character-1"><a href="#01Upload-Your-Own-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="01Upload Your Own Character"></a>01Upload Your Own Character</h3><p>To start, you’ll need to visit ‘Maximo.com’ and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)</p>
<p>You can also sign-up for free if you’d like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.</p>
<p>Once you’re logged in, go to the ‘Editor’ panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don’t worry. The next should help.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-1"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-1"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-1" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro-1"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-1"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-1" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-1"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-1" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX-1"><a href="#05IKMAX-1" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-1"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-1" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in introducing animations into your content but you don’t have the time or the patience to get too involved with <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>The <strong>Adobe Auto rigger</strong> is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of <strong>Adobe 3D Rigging</strong>.) It’s a perfect tool for beginners.</p>
<p>Especially those that aren’t really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.</p>

These can be found under the ‘Characters’ tab (shown in the image below.)</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don’t have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.</p>

<p>This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you’ve confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.</p>

You’ll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you’ll be able to download your now rigged model for use.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-3"><a href="#Part-3-Other-AWESOME-Auto-Rigger-Tools-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools"></a>Part 3 <strong>Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools</strong></h2><p>Now, just in case you’re interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for <strong>rigging in Adobe Animate</strong> and After Effects… We’ve included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They’re all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)</p>
<h3 id="01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-3"><a href="#01InstantRig-Auto-Rigger-3" class="headerlink" title="01InstantRig - Auto Rigger"></a>01InstantRig - Auto Rigger</h3><p>The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.’ This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it’s a ‘modular rigging’ tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)</p>
<h3 id="02Auto-Rig-Pro-3"><a href="#02Auto-Rig-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="02Auto-Rig Pro"></a>02Auto-Rig Pro</h3><p>Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the <strong>Adobe Animate Puppet Rig</strong> tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature’ that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.</p>
<h3 id="03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-3"><a href="#03Perseus-Auto-Rig-Maya-3" class="headerlink" title="03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya"></a>03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya</h3><p>Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There’s the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging’ license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging’ license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging’ license for non-humanoid creatures.</p>
<h3 id="04Auto-Character-Setup-3"><a href="#04Auto-Character-Setup-3" class="headerlink" title="04Auto Character Setup"></a>04Auto Character Setup</h3><p>Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there’s something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.</p>
<h3 id="05IKMAX-3"><a href="#05IKMAX-3" class="headerlink" title="05IKMAX"></a>05IKMAX</h3><p>For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we’ve mentioned before. It’s very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-3"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in introducing animations into your content but you don’t have the time or the patience to get too involved with <strong>Adobe Rigging</strong> (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>Adobe Auto Rigger</strong>, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If Adobe is not your software of choice, don’t worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.</p>

<p>If what you’re searching for is a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.</p>

We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools and <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>The first <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.</p>
<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01Step-1-Launch-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Launch Filmora Video Editor"></a>01Step 1: Launch <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>First things first, launch the <strong>3D GIF maker</strong> that you intend to use. In our case, that is Filmora (a screenshot has been provided below for your edification and reference. We’ll be using Filmora as our example.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media &gt; Import Media File.

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>
<p>And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

<p>The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone’s Camera rolling permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature &amp; and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a <strong>celebrities</strong> option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D &amp; Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.</p>

<p>The process behind creating a <strong>3D cartoon of yourself</strong> for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on.

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

<p>Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can then ‘liquify’ these layers to form a mould for your image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.</p>

<p>When creating a nose from the front, it’s typical to leave off many details. Even if you merely sketch its tip, it will likely provide a convincing impact. Drawing only one side of the nose is also quite frequent. Children’s mouths are extremely simple in cartoon style, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>The ears are viewed from the front; therefore, the internal holes are not visible. The circle has already established the shape of our head.</p>

So, all we need is an effortless and playful haircut to bring our boy to life. Because there is no particular method for drawing hair, you’ll have to experiment until you find the perfect look. Look for photo references on the internet! Take a look at a magazine shoot or a Google search.</p>

<p>Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.</p>

<p>When creating a nose from the front, it’s typical to leave off many details. Even if you merely sketch its tip, it will likely provide a convincing impact. Drawing only one side of the nose is also quite frequent. Children’s mouths are extremely simple in cartoon style, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>The ears are viewed from the front; therefore, the internal holes are not visible. The circle has already established the shape of our head.</p>

So, all we need is an effortless and playful haircut to bring our boy to life. Because there is no particular method for drawing hair, you’ll have to experiment until you find the perfect look. Look for photo references on the internet! Take a look at a magazine shoot or a Google search.</p>

<p>To stay under the eyelashes, move the eye pupils up. That’s all there is to it! With just a few tweaks, we achieved the desired result. The circular form of the eyes, hair, ears, nose, chin and the circular shape of the ears are all the same! It’s that simple!</p>
