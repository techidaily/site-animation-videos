<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>
<p>Now, as for its features, today, we’ll be focusing on <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> features.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Use-Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Use Blender Rigging?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Use Blender Rigging?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong> is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it’s capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.</p>
<p>So, if you want to create video projects for your audience’s entertainment or edification with animation, then <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> animations.)</p>

<p>These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we’ve linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it’s something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender’ experience.)</p>
<h3 id="01Blender-Character-Rigging"><a href="#01Blender-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="01Blender Character Rigging"></a>01<strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong></h3><p>The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, <strong>Blender Character Rigging</strong>. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.</p>
<h3 id="02Blender-Facial-Rigging"><a href="#02Blender-Facial-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Blender Facial Rigging"></a>02<strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong></h3><p>Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about <strong>Blender Facial Rigging</strong> from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face’s character to become animated.)</p>
<h3 id="03Blender-Muscle-Rigging"><a href="#03Blender-Muscle-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="03Blender Muscle Rigging"></a>03<strong>Blender Muscle Rigging</strong></h3><p>Creating a <strong>Blender Muscle Rig</strong> is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage’ as you say, with your Animations. The video that we’ve attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> in general and has extensively explained how to create a <strong>Blender Human Rig</strong> from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="04Blender-Rigging"><a href="#04Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Blender Rigging"></a>04<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional’ methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It’s an especially good skill to learn if you’re more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)</p>
<h3 id="05Blender-Rigging"><a href="#05Blender-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="05Blender Rigging"></a>05<strong>Blender Rigging</strong></h3><p>This next tutorial is an introduction to basic <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. It’s a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course"><a href="#Part-3-Introduction-to-Rigging-in-Blender-Course" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course"></a>Part 3 <strong>Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course</strong></h2><p>For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about <strong>Blender Rigging</strong>. Whether it be about <strong>Blender character rigging</strong>, <strong>Blender facial rigging</strong>, <strong>free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs</strong>, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.</p>
<h3 id="01Where-to-Learn-the-Course"><a href="#01Where-to-Learn-the-Course" class="headerlink" title="01Where to Learn the Course?"></a>01<strong>Where to Learn the Course?</strong></h3><p>The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters’ <strong>blender rigging</strong> course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.</p>

<h3 id="02Other-Tools-to-Learn-Rigging"><a href="#02Other-Tools-to-Learn-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="02Other Tools to Learn Rigging"></a>02<strong>Other Tools to Learn Rigging</strong></h3><p>As for other places to learn? We suggest the “Blender Fundamentals” course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is “Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of <strong>Blender rigging</strong> (including <strong>Blender rigging</strong> and <strong>Blender rigging</strong> videos.)</p>

<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> If you’re interested in trying out <strong>blender rigging</strong> yourself, you’ll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common <strong>Blender Rigging</strong> subjects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you’re looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master’s introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender’s own “Blender Fundamental” series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you’ll need to know.)</p>

<p>Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It’s a good way of starting if you’re not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won’t demand any immediate monetary commitment.</p>

Without knowing what a particular tool can do, you’ll most likely struggle to pour your creativity into the Blender 2D animation. So, before working on your first 2D animation, make sure to take your time to go through these Blender 2D animation tutorials uploaded by the tech giant itself.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it’s not a single video, but a series of episodes that’ll walk you through the basics of Blender and how to start with your first 2D&#x2F;3D animation. If you are serious about working with Blender, this series is your one-stop solution to get familiar with the application.</p>
<h3 id="4-Character-Creation-and-Rigging-3"><a href="#4-Character-Creation-and-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Character Creation and Rigging"></a>4. Character Creation and Rigging</h3><p>Every 2D animation requires at least one character that would act as the main subject of the animation. And, in case you are planning to create a 3D animation with extensive movement, you’ll also have to incorporate Rigging to ensure that any movement looks realistic.</p>
<p>This video is for anyone who has a basic understanding of 2D animation in Blender and wants to step up their game. Here you’ll learn how to design a specific character on the canvas and how to use rigging to configure its movement. Again, this is not a single video, but a series of episodes, which means it would be better if you sit with your coffee in your hand.</p>

In this video, CG Geek goes on explaining how to use the Grease Pencil feature in Blender for 2D animation. He has also explained how to keyframe your 2D animation on Blender’s timeline so that any movement looks as realistic as possible.</p>

Wondershare Filmora - A Reliable Alternative to Blender for Video Editors"></a>6. Wondershare Filmora - A Reliable Alternative to Blender for Video Editors</h3><p>Now, if you are a video editor and only want to create an animation for one of your videos, it would not be a wise decision to use Blender. Why? Because the tool has a steep learning curve and it’s not worth investing your time if you only want to create a 10-seconds animation. So, what’s the next best solution?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. It’s a full-scale video editing tool that’s designed to help editors enhance their productivity through ready-to-use templates. It has a built-in media library where you’ll find dozens of animation templates. You can simply drag these templates to your timeline and customize them to match the overall theme of your video itself.</p>
<p>With its timeline-based editing panel, you’ll be able to speed up the overall editing process and create visually stunning videos in no time. The tool also has a stack of ready-to-use transitions, special effects, and sounds that you can apply to the video and improve the overall production quality. In short, if your only goal is to add a 2D animation to your video, it won’t be a wise decision to rely on Blender. Instead, download and install Wondershare Filmora Pro on your system and use it to edit the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Apply Filter-Sharpen</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter to sharpen the image. Select the Gaussian Blur from the Remove drop-down list</p>
<p>Press OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Apply Filter-Stylize</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter, then apply stylization and Oil paint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Choose Poster Edges</strong></p>
<p>Choose from the list of effects on the filter gallery, click on Poster Edges and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="choose poster edges"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Blur</strong></p>
<p>It will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 15 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels. This effect gives the skin a considerably smoother and cleaner appearance. Select OK.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Unsharp Mask</strong></p>
<p>You can add some sharpness and increase particular highlights by going to Filter &gt; Sharpen &gt; Unsharp Mask.</p>
<p>Unhide the second Smart Object layer and change its blending mode to Overlay. Then, reduce the layer’s Opacity to 55 percent.</p>
<p>Now, it will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 12 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select Image</strong></p>
<p>Now, choose an image you want to cartoonize.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Apply Filter-Sharpen</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter to sharpen the image. Select the Gaussian Blur from the Remove drop-down list</p>
<p>Press OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="apply filter-sharpen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Apply Filter-Stylize</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter, then apply stylization and Oil paint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="apply filter-stylize"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Choose Poster Edges</strong></p>
<p>Choose from the list of effects on the filter gallery, click on Poster Edges and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="choose poster edges"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Blur</strong></p>
<p>It will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 15 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels. This effect gives the skin a considerably smoother and cleaner appearance. Select OK.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Unsharp Mask</strong></p>
<p>You can add some sharpness and increase particular highlights by going to Filter &gt; Sharpen &gt; Unsharp Mask.</p>
<p>Unhide the second Smart Object layer and change its blending mode to Overlay. Then, reduce the layer’s Opacity to 55 percent.</p>
<p>Now, it will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 12 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Apply the Oil paint filter again</strong></p>

<p>Choose the Oil Paint Filter from Filter &gt; Stylize. Select OK.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select Image</strong></p>
<p>Now, choose an image you want to cartoonize.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-12.jpg"
                      alt="select image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Apply Filter-Sharpen</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter to sharpen the image. Select the Gaussian Blur from the Remove drop-down list</p>
<p>Press OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-13.jpg"
                      alt="apply filter-sharpen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Apply Filter-Stylize</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter, then apply stylization and Oil paint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-14.jpg"
                      alt="apply filter-stylize"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Choose Poster Edges</strong></p>
<p>Choose from the list of effects on the filter gallery, click on Poster Edges and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-15.jpg"
                      alt="choose poster edges"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Blur</strong></p>
<p>It will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 15 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels. This effect gives the skin a considerably smoother and cleaner appearance. Select OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-16.jpg"
                      alt="blur"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Unsharp Mask</strong></p>
<p>You can add some sharpness and increase particular highlights by going to Filter &gt; Sharpen &gt; Unsharp Mask.</p>
<p>Unhide the second Smart Object layer and change its blending mode to Overlay. Then, reduce the layer’s Opacity to 55 percent.</p>
<p>Now, it will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 12 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="unsharp mask"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Apply the Oil paint filter again</strong></p>
<p>Return to Filter &gt; Filter Gallery and select Poster Edges once more. These will draw attention to certain aspects of the portrait.</p>
<p>Choose the Oil Paint Filter from Filter &gt; Stylize. Select OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="apply oil pain filter again"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Double-click on Filter Gallery</strong></p>
<p>Click OK after double-clicking the Filter Gallery Smart Filter already on this layer.</p>
<p>Carry on with the same steps for the Oil Paint Filter.</p>
<p>Select OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-19.jpg"
                      alt="double-clicking filter gallery"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Choose the Raw filter option</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take this <strong>photo cartoon effect</strong> to the next level with a simple method! To make a Stamp Visible Layer, choose the very top layer and press Control-Shift-Alt-E. When you wish to merge all the layers in a document onto a new layer, this shortcut comes in handy.</p>
<p>Lastly, convert the new layer to a Smart Object by right-clicking on it.</p>
<p>Select the Camera Raw Filter option from the Filter menu.</p>

The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

<p>The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an <strong>online photo animator</strong> and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Comes with a veritable library of templates, effects, and filters for advanced photo editing and photo animation.</p>
