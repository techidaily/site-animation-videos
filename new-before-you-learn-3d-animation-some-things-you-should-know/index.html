<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and <strong>animation cartoons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Before you start learning 3d animation and create <strong>cartoon photos,</strong> ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>

                      alt="3d animation mistakes?"
                ></p>
<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and <strong>animation cartoons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Before you start learning 3d animation and create <strong>cartoon photos,</strong> ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers&#x2F;creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms &amp; Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-1"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>
<p>Once everything is complete, click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the <strong>Preview</strong> window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the <strong>animated travel map</strong> in your preferred format.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                      alt="create travel map video with pictramap "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview the Animation</strong></p>
<p>Click the <strong>View Animation</strong> button from the upper-right corner of the page to see the <strong>animated travel map</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-3.png"
                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>

<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg"
                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>
<p>Once everything is complete, click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the <strong>Preview</strong> window to review your work.

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-3"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers&#x2F;creators of the symbols while using their objects.

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<h3 id="01They-grab-viewers-attraction"><a href="#01They-grab-viewers-attraction" class="headerlink" title="01They grab viewers attraction"></a>01They grab viewers attraction</h3><p>The human mind chooses to believe in the supremacy of what appeals to them visually. It is highly important to grab the user’s attention in order to make a mark. Animated logos help your website to visually appeal to the viewer and grab his&#x2F;her attention.

The logo should be capable enough of explaining your website’s understanding about the field. For instance, if your company is in the cyber security domain, the logo should be good enough to justify your company’s expertise. Animated logos help you establish trust by conveying more through the medium of a logo.</p>

Research suggested that about 99 percent of brands use video marketing in order to enhance their brand image. Starting of your video with an animated logo will not just look catchy but also make the video all the more professional.</p>

The logo is simply fantastic due to the meaning it conveys without any complex animation. The animated logo involves the traditional venn diagram logo of mastercard morphing into several objects. These objects include everything from food to groceries to luxurious products. It basically includes the various kinds of commodities people buy using mastercards.</p>
<h3 id="02Burger-king"><a href="#02Burger-king" class="headerlink" title="02Burger king"></a>02Burger king</h3><p>Another popular brand that uses animated logos is the american fast food giant, burger king. The logo is not highly flashy like we see in mastercard. However, the animated logo does obviously look more attention seeking than the conventional static logo. The logo shows the stacking of the different elements of the logo one by one over each other. This resembles the process of making a burger.</p>
<h3 id="03Fedex"><a href="#03Fedex" class="headerlink" title="03Fedex"></a>03Fedex</h3><p>Another logo that would classify as a flashy animated logo is the fedex logo. Initially, fedex had experimented with several logos before sticking to the arrow logo which continues even today. The animated logo involves an arrow making the letter “Fedex” with its trajectory and then finally settling in between letters X and E. The logistics giant delivers couriers from one corner of the world to another, and the arrow symbolizes exactly that!</p>
<h3 id="04Flickr"><a href="#04Flickr" class="headerlink" title="04Flickr"></a>04Flickr</h3><p>Flickr is a popular stock image and video hosting platform. Anyone can use the stock images and videos in their content. The logo starts with a blue and pink dot initially. These dots later expand in a whirlpool like motion. The logo starts off with the static logo before it expands. The idea is to show that the online stock image portal goes beyond limits and has every picture and video you’d need</p>
<h3 id="05Bundle"><a href="#05Bundle" class="headerlink" title="05Bundle"></a>05Bundle</h3><p>Bundle is a popular app that offers its users rewards upon shopping from selected stores. These stores have an alliance with bundle and upon shopping from them, users seek reward points on the bundle app. The animated logo starts of with a pink screen which later converges to become a large “B” wrapped with a gifting ribbon. Although, the logo is pretty simple it does an amazing job at explaining the brand’s MSP and attracts customers.</p>
<h3 id="06Google"><a href="#06Google" class="headerlink" title="06Google"></a>06Google</h3><p>The logo of google has evolved over the years. Google is almost synonymous to attractive logos and it comes up with attractive new logos every now and then.

<p>When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to <strong>convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop</strong>, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. Its file format is a compressed image, and it is most suitable for animation. We all know that an animated GIF comprises a series of many still images. However, since these images play sequentially, it may appear as if they are in motion. It is that movement illusion that makes the animation effect come about.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size.

<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>

<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>

That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small.

<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>

<p>When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to <strong>convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop</strong>, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. Its file format is a compressed image, and it is most suitable for animation. We all know that an animated GIF comprises a series of many still images. However, since these images play sequentially, it may appear as if they are in motion. It is that movement illusion that makes the animation effect come about.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>

<p>Till now, you learned about how to animate a picture on Canva. Now, let’s comprehend the right way to use Filmora for animating and adding images in the video.</p>
<p>Before using, make sure to update the software to its latest version. Follow separate methods for both Windows and Mac.</p>
<h3 id="For-Win-3"><a href="#For-Win-3" class="headerlink" title="For Win"></a>For Win</h3><h4 id="Step-1：-Adding-Image-to-Video-Track-3"><a href="#Step-1：-Adding-Image-to-Video-Track-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1： Adding Image to Video Track"></a>Step 1： Adding Image to Video Track</h4><p>With Filmora, adding images to video is a matter of seconds! Start by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the position where you want to add the image and place the Playhead there.</li>
<li>Right-click on the picture from the media library. Click on the “Insert” option. Your image will be added. Select the “Append” option, if you want to add an image at the video end.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-3.JPG"
                      alt="Adding Image to Video Track"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: How to Remove Black Bars around the Image?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to “Settings” from the File section.</li>
<li>Click on the “Editing” tab and select “Photo Placement.”</li>
<li>Choose from the “Crop to Fit” or “Pan To Zoom” option. The black bars will be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add the image in between the video clip, split them. Now, add the image between the split parts.</p>
<h4 id="Step-2：-Add-Images-as-Overlays-3"><a href="#Step-2：-Add-Images-as-Overlays-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2： Add Images as Overlays"></a>Step 2： Add Images as Overlays</h4><p>To add images as overlays, drag the image to a video track above the main track. The main track consists of your video.</p>
<p>Track 1 (or the track with a video clip) is the base of your video. If you add anything else, it will be displayed above this track as video track 2, 3, and so on. Overall, you can add 100 video tracks.</p>
<h4 id="Step-3：-Edit-Your-Image-3"><a href="#Step-3：-Edit-Your-Image-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3： Edit Your Image"></a>Step 3： Edit Your Image</h4><p>If you know how to animate an image in Canva, editing images on Filmora is even easier. You can try the following methods:</p>
<p><strong>Animate Your Images</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To add animation presets to the image, click on the image twice.</li>
<li>Go to the “Animation Tab” and look for an animation preset.</li>
<li>Drag the presets to the image for its effect</li>
</ul>
