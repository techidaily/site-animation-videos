Stacking animation – YouTube"></a>1. Stacking animation – YouTube</h3><p>Stacking animation is an excellent and simple trick that can make any animation look cool and complex. The stacking animation is nothing but the use of the stacking template multiple times. To do so, you just need to duplicate a few of the base layers. Next, you need to offset the duplicated frames by a few frames and finally add some effects. The Adding of stacking animation will result in a slight extension of your animation layers. You can further customize your frames by adding effects or color to enhance the animation.</p>

<p>If what you’re searching for is a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs"><a href="#Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs"></a>Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs</h2><p>First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools and <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-4"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-4" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>The first <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.</p>
<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media &gt; Import Media File.

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>

<p>This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.</p>

<p>If what you’re searching for is a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs-2"><a href="#Part-1-Best-3-Ways-to-Create-3D-Animated-GIFs-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs"></a>Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs</h2><p>First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> tools and <strong>3D GIF Generator</strong> tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-6"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-6" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h3><p>The first <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong> on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.</p>
<p> <strong>Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)</strong></p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<h3 id="022-Adobe-Photoshop-2"><a href="#022-Adobe-Photoshop-2" class="headerlink" title="022. Adobe Photoshop"></a>022. Adobe Photoshop</h3><p>Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere <strong>3D GIF Maker</strong>. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.</p>
<p>The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<h3 id="03EaseUS-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#03EaseUS-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="03EaseUS Video Editor"></a>03EaseUS Video Editor</h3><p>Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a <strong>3D GIF Creator</strong> quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.</p>
<p>The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#Part-2-Create-3D-Animated-Gifs-Online-With-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a <strong>3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker</strong>, and so on.)</p>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media &gt; Import Media File.

Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.</p>
<p>Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked [1] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked [2] in the image below) in order to create a video.</p>

Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add Text or audio to video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Add transitions for better video flow.</p>
<p>And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.</p>

<p>This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.</p>

This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-a-Stop-Motion-Movie"><a href="#01What-is-a-Stop-Motion-Movie" class="headerlink" title="01What is a Stop Motion Movie?"></a>01<strong>What is a Stop Motion Movie?</strong></h3><p>The best way to introduce the concept of <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.</p>
<p>It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it’s the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing ‘motion’ by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.</p>
<h3 id="02What-is-the-Most-Successful-Stop-Motion-Movie"><a href="#02What-is-the-Most-Successful-Stop-Motion-Movie" class="headerlink" title="02What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?"></a>02<strong>What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?</strong></h3><p>There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever <strong>stop motion movie</strong> to be made? Which was “The Humpty Dumpty Circus” created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter’s dolls.</p>
<p>You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the “Nightmare Before Christmas” or “Rudolph the Reindeer.” And finally. You have “Chicken Run” which is considered the best performing <strong>stop motion movie</strong> of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Popular-Stop-Motion-Movies-You-Might-Wonder"><a href="#Part-2-Popular-Stop-Motion-Movies-You-Might-Wonder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder"></a>Part 2 <strong>Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder</strong></h2><p>Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?</p>
<h3 id="01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies"><a href="#01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies" class="headerlink" title="01Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>01<strong>Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with <strong>Lego Movie stop motion</strong> animation. This <strong>stop motion movie</strong> animation style, also called ‘Brickfilms’, is the practice of using Lego to create <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong>. It’s been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.</p>
<p>It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies"><a href="#023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies" class="headerlink" title="023D Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>02<strong>3D Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Alright, so how about 3D <strong>stop motion movies</strong>? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it’s actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).</p>
<p>In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called “Tune with Tomorrow” but you might be more familiar with the title “Coraline.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films"><a href="#Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films</strong></h2><p>Now for our list of the best <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.</p>
<h3 id="01Coraline-2009"><a href="#01Coraline-2009" class="headerlink" title="01Coraline (2009)"></a>01<strong>Coraline (2009)</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this <strong>stop motion movie</strong> previously, but in case you haven’t already watched it, it’s a classic. The storytelling elements of “Coraline” really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn’t all that it was chalked up to be.</p>
<h3 id="02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993"><a href="#02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993" class="headerlink" title="02The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)"></a>02<strong>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</strong></h3><p>“The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993) is another <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington’s obsession with ruining Christmas.</p>
<h3 id="03Chicken-Run-1994"><a href="#03Chicken-Run-1994" class="headerlink" title="03Chicken Run (1994)"></a>03<strong>Chicken Run (1994)</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>stop motion movie</strong>, called “Chicken Run” (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.</p>
<h3 id="04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009"><a href="#04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009" class="headerlink" title="04Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)"></a>04<strong>Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)</strong></h3><p>The next film, released in the same year as “Coraline”, is called “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, ‘Mr. Fox’ and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.</p>
<h3 id="05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964"><a href="#05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964" class="headerlink" title="05Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)"></a>05<strong>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)</strong></h3><p>Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.</p>
<h3 id="06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016"><a href="#06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016" class="headerlink" title="06Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)"></a>06<strong>Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)</strong></h3><p>From the makers of Coraline is the <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>, called “Kubo and The Two Strings” (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It’s quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.</p>
<h3 id="07Alice-1988"><a href="#07Alice-1988" class="headerlink" title="07Alice (1988)"></a>07<strong>Alice (1988)</strong></h3><p>This next stop motion film is quite unique. It’s called “Alice” and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.</p>
<h3 id="088-Mary-and-Max-2009"><a href="#088-Mary-and-Max-2009" class="headerlink" title="088. Mary and Max (2009)"></a>08<strong>8. Mary and Max (2009)</strong></h3><p>Another <strong>stop motion movie</strong> that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called “Mary and Max.” This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.</p>
<h3 id="09The-Little-Prince-2016"><a href="#09The-Little-Prince-2016" class="headerlink" title="09The Little Prince (2016)"></a>09<strong>The Little Prince (2016)</strong></h3><p>Categorizing this film as ‘stop motion’ one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn’t detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of “The Little Prince.”</p>
<h3 id="10Frankenweenie-2012"><a href="#10Frankenweenie-2012" class="headerlink" title="10Frankenweenie (2012)"></a>10<strong>Frankenweenie (2012)</strong></h3><p>Another classic that you might recognize is “Frankenweenie” which was released in 2012. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movie"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movie" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie</strong></h2><p>For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised ‘tutorial’. It won’t be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how <strong>stop motion movies</strong> are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Get-a-Camera"><a href="#01Step-1-Get-a-Camera" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Get a Camera."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Get a Camera.</strong></h3><p>The first and most important part of setting up for a stop <strong>motion movie</strong> is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you’ll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.</p>
<p>In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.</p>

Prepare Materials for the Set.</strong></h3><p>Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you’ll need some pre-prepared in order to start.</p>
<p>This can be Lego action figures (if you’re working on a <strong>Lego stop motion movie</strong>) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you’re working on a 3D animation <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>.)</p>

Prepare the Set.</strong></h3><p>For stop motion, it’s important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.</p>
<p>And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it’s best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best <strong>stop motion movies</strong> in film history, you’ll notice that they’re all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.</p>

<p>It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.</p>

How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it’s actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).</p>
<p>In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called “Tune with Tomorrow” but you might be more familiar with the title “Coraline.”</p>

This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.</p>
<h3 id="01Coraline-2009-1"><a href="#01Coraline-2009-1" class="headerlink" title="01Coraline (2009)"></a>01<strong>Coraline (2009)</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this <strong>stop motion movie</strong> previously, but in case you haven’t already watched it, it’s a classic. The storytelling elements of “Coraline” really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn’t all that it was chalked up to be.</p>
<h3 id="02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993-1"><a href="#02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993-1" class="headerlink" title="02The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)"></a>02<strong>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</strong></h3><p>“The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993) is another <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington’s obsession with ruining Christmas.</p>
<h3 id="03Chicken-Run-1994-1"><a href="#03Chicken-Run-1994-1" class="headerlink" title="03Chicken Run (1994)"></a>03<strong>Chicken Run (1994)</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>stop motion movie</strong>, called “Chicken Run” (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.</p>
<h3 id="04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009-1"><a href="#04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009-1" class="headerlink" title="04Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)"></a>04<strong>Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)</strong></h3><p>The next film, released in the same year as “Coraline”, is called “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, ‘Mr. Fox’ and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.</p>
<h3 id="05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964-1"><a href="#05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964-1" class="headerlink" title="05Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)"></a>05<strong>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)</strong></h3><p>Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.</p>
<h3 id="06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016-1"><a href="#06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016-1" class="headerlink" title="06Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)"></a>06<strong>Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)</strong></h3><p>From the makers of Coraline is the <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>, called “Kubo and The Two Strings” (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It’s quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.</p>
<h3 id="07Alice-1988-1"><a href="#07Alice-1988-1" class="headerlink" title="07Alice (1988)"></a>07<strong>Alice (1988)</strong></h3><p>This next stop motion film is quite unique. It’s called “Alice” and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.</p>
<h3 id="088-Mary-and-Max-2009-1"><a href="#088-Mary-and-Max-2009-1" class="headerlink" title="088. Mary and Max (2009)"></a>08<strong>8. Mary and Max (2009)</strong></h3><p>Another <strong>stop motion movie</strong> that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called “Mary and Max.” This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.</p>
<h3 id="09The-Little-Prince-2016-1"><a href="#09The-Little-Prince-2016-1" class="headerlink" title="09The Little Prince (2016)"></a>09<strong>The Little Prince (2016)</strong></h3><p>Categorizing this film as ‘stop motion’ one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn’t detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of “The Little Prince.”</p>
<h3 id="10Frankenweenie-2012-1"><a href="#10Frankenweenie-2012-1" class="headerlink" title="10Frankenweenie (2012)"></a>10<strong>Frankenweenie (2012)</strong></h3><p>Another classic that you might recognize is “Frankenweenie” which was released in 2012. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.</p>

Get a Camera.</strong></h3><p>The first and most important part of setting up for a stop <strong>motion movie</strong> is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you’ll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.</p>
<p>In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.</p>

<p>This can be Lego action figures (if you’re working on a <strong>Lego stop motion movie</strong>) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you’re working on a 3D animation <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>.)</p>

<p>And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it’s best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best <strong>stop motion movies</strong> in film history, you’ll notice that they’re all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.</p>

This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.</p>
<p>It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it’s the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing ‘motion’ by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.</p>

Perhaps it should be the first-ever <strong>stop motion movie</strong> to be made? Which was “The Humpty Dumpty Circus” created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter’s dolls.</p>
<p>You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the “Nightmare Before Christmas” or “Rudolph the Reindeer.” And finally. You have “Chicken Run” which is considered the best performing <strong>stop motion movie</strong> of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Movies-Use-Stop-Motion-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Movies-Use-Stop-Motion-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?</strong></h2><p>First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-a-Stop-Motion-Movie-3"><a href="#01What-is-a-Stop-Motion-Movie-3" class="headerlink" title="01What is a Stop Motion Movie?"></a>01<strong>What is a Stop Motion Movie?</strong></h3><p>The best way to introduce the concept of <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.</p>
<p>It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it’s the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing ‘motion’ by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.</p>
<h3 id="02What-is-the-Most-Successful-Stop-Motion-Movie-3"><a href="#02What-is-the-Most-Successful-Stop-Motion-Movie-3" class="headerlink" title="02What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?"></a>02<strong>What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?</strong></h3><p>There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever <strong>stop motion movie</strong> to be made? Which was “The Humpty Dumpty Circus” created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter’s dolls.</p>
<p>You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the “Nightmare Before Christmas” or “Rudolph the Reindeer.” And finally. You have “Chicken Run” which is considered the best performing <strong>stop motion movie</strong> of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Popular-Stop-Motion-Movies-You-Might-Wonder-3"><a href="#Part-2-Popular-Stop-Motion-Movies-You-Might-Wonder-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder"></a>Part 2 <strong>Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder</strong></h2><p>Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?</p>
<h3 id="01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-3"><a href="#01Lego-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-3" class="headerlink" title="01Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>01<strong>Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with <strong>Lego Movie stop motion</strong> animation. This <strong>stop motion movie</strong> animation style, also called ‘Brickfilms’, is the practice of using Lego to create <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong>. It’s been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.</p>
<p>It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.</p>
<h3 id="023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-3"><a href="#023D-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movies-3" class="headerlink" title="023D Stop Motion Animation Movies"></a>02<strong>3D Stop Motion Animation Movies</strong></h3><p>Alright, so how about 3D <strong>stop motion movies</strong>? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it’s actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).</p>
<p>In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called “Tune with Tomorrow” but you might be more familiar with the title “Coraline.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films-3"><a href="#Part-3-Top-10-Stop-Motion-Animation-Films-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films"></a>Part 3 <strong>Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films</strong></h2><p>Now for our list of the best <strong>stop motion animation movies</strong> of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the <strong>stop motion movies</strong> on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.</p>
<h3 id="01Coraline-2009-3"><a href="#01Coraline-2009-3" class="headerlink" title="01Coraline (2009)"></a>01<strong>Coraline (2009)</strong></h3><p>We mentioned this <strong>stop motion movie</strong> previously, but in case you haven’t already watched it, it’s a classic. The storytelling elements of “Coraline” really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn’t all that it was chalked up to be.</p>
<h3 id="02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993-3"><a href="#02The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas-1993-3" class="headerlink" title="02The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)"></a>02<strong>The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)</strong></h3><p>“The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993) is another <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington’s obsession with ruining Christmas.</p>
<h3 id="03Chicken-Run-1994-3"><a href="#03Chicken-Run-1994-3" class="headerlink" title="03Chicken Run (1994)"></a>03<strong>Chicken Run (1994)</strong></h3><p>This next <strong>stop motion movie</strong>, called “Chicken Run” (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong> on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.</p>
<h3 id="04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009-3"><a href="#04Fantastic-Mr-Fox-2009-3" class="headerlink" title="04Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)"></a>04<strong>Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)</strong></h3><p>The next film, released in the same year as “Coraline”, is called “Fantastic Mr. Fox.” This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, ‘Mr. Fox’ and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.</p>
<h3 id="05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964-3"><a href="#05Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-1964-3" class="headerlink" title="05Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)"></a>05<strong>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)</strong></h3><p>Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.</p>
<h3 id="06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016-3"><a href="#06Kubo-and-The-Two-Strings-2016-3" class="headerlink" title="06Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)"></a>06<strong>Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)</strong></h3><p>From the makers of Coraline is the <strong>stop motion animation movie</strong>, called “Kubo and The Two Strings” (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It’s quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.</p>
<h3 id="07Alice-1988-3"><a href="#07Alice-1988-3" class="headerlink" title="07Alice (1988)"></a>07<strong>Alice (1988)</strong></h3><p>This next stop motion film is quite unique. It’s called “Alice” and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.</p>
<h3 id="088-Mary-and-Max-2009-3"><a href="#088-Mary-and-Max-2009-3" class="headerlink" title="088. Mary and Max (2009)"></a>08<strong>8. Mary and Max (2009)</strong></h3><p>Another <strong>stop motion movie</strong> that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called “Mary and Max.” This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.</p>
<h3 id="09The-Little-Prince-2016-3"><a href="#09The-Little-Prince-2016-3" class="headerlink" title="09The Little Prince (2016)"></a>09<strong>The Little Prince (2016)</strong></h3><p>Categorizing this film as ‘stop motion’ one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn’t detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of “The Little Prince.”</p>
<h3 id="10Frankenweenie-2012-3"><a href="#10Frankenweenie-2012-3" class="headerlink" title="10Frankenweenie (2012)"></a>10<strong>Frankenweenie (2012)</strong></h3><p>Another classic that you might recognize is “Frankenweenie” which was released in 2012. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movie-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-a-Stop-Motion-Animation-Movie-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie</strong></h2><p>For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised ‘tutorial’. It won’t be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how <strong>stop motion movies</strong> are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Get-a-Camera-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Get-a-Camera-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Get a Camera."></a>01<strong>Step 1. Get a Camera.</strong></h3><p>The first and most important part of setting up for a stop <strong>motion movie</strong> is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you’ll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.</p>
<p>In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.</p>
