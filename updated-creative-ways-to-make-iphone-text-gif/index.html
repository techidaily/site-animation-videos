<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Text-a-GIF-For-iOS-and-Android-Users"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Text-a-GIF-For-iOS-and-Android-Users" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Text a GIF: For iOS and Android Users"></a>Part 1 How to Text a GIF: For iOS and Android Users</h2><p><strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> make texting more fun. Hence, we dedicated this part to teaching you how to use <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> to revitalize and better express yourself while texting.</p>
<p>On iPhone, there are two different ways to send iPhone text GIFs – employing the default keyboard or through the help of third-party apps. You can use the iOS default keyboard to search for GIFs in iMessage on iPhones directly. This applies to all iPhones running on iOS 10 and later versions. If your iPhone belongs to this category, follow the simple steps to add <strong>GIFs in text messages on iPhone</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard"><a href="#01Sending-GIFs-using-the-iPhone-Default-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard"></a>01Sending GIFs using the iPhone Default Keyboard</h3><p>Here’s how you can send <strong>iPhone text GIFs</strong> using the iOS default keyboard:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-3.jpg"
                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-5.jpg"
                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-6.jpg"
                      alt="select your desired GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Send icon, represented as a blue arrow icon, to send your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-7.jpg"
                      alt="hit send"
                ></p>
<p>You can add comments to a GIF just before sending it on the iMessage app. Type a message under the GIF before clicking “Send” to get the comment delivered together with the GIF.</p>
<p>From these simple steps, you can tell that sending a GIF from an iOS default keyboard is straightforward.</p>

Using the Gboard keyboard, follow the steps below to add a GIF on Android:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Open the Message app and at the bottom of the screen, click the text bubble icon to enter the name of the person you’re texting in the contact field &gt; Click Start.</p>

                      alt="launch message and click start"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click the smiley icon on the keyboard &gt; Swipe to browse through GIFs and stickers or enter a search text to find your desired GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-9.jpg"
                      alt="launch message and click start"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select the GIF you want by clicking on it &gt; Hit Send.</p>

These applications are built to add character to text messaging using animated objects called GIFs. Adding a GIF to your texts usually brings in some humor and life. You must have downloaded them from App Store and installed them on your iPhone to use these applications.</p>
<p>You can also visit third-party websites to send GIFs from there. For example, GIPHY supports searching and sending GIFs via iMessage.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to follow to search and send <strong>GIFs on iPhone text</strong> messages on iMessage using third-party tools:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Search for your desired GIF on GIPHY or other GIF websites.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-10.jpg"
                      alt="search for your preferred GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the GIF to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-11.jpg"
                      alt="open the GIF by clicking on it"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Long press on the GIF, and from the pop-up options, click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-12.jpg"
                      alt="long press on the GIF"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch Messages, click the Write icon and enter the person’s contact details you want to text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-13.jpg"
                      alt="select the contact you want to text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Click on the text box to bring up your iOS keyboard.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-14.jpg"
                      alt="click on the text box"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click on the text box again to add the paste option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-15.jpg"
                      alt="click again to bring up the paste option "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: When the GIF appears, click Paste.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-16.jpg"
                      alt="click paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: A preview of the GIF would appear on the text box. Hit Send when you’re ready to send the GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-17.jpg"
                      alt="tap send"
                ></p>
<p>If you use a GIF website other than GIPHY, the sent GIF may appear as a link rather than an image. If you’re okay with that, make sure the address of the shared animated image you end with the file extension, “.gif” if not, iMessage would not be able to load it.</p>

                      alt="click again to bring up the paste option "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: When the GIF appears, click Paste.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: A preview of the GIF would appear on the text box. Hit Send when you’re ready to send the GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-17.jpg"
                      alt="tap send"
                ></p>
<p>If you use a GIF website other than GIPHY, the sent GIF may appear as a link rather than an image. If you’re okay with that, make sure the address of the shared animated image you end with the file extension, “.gif” if not, iMessage would not be able to load it.</p>

<p>GIFs add fun and humor to interactions via text messages. GIFs allow you to convey ideas, emotions, and thoughts in much more precise ways than an emoji would. iPhones operating on iOS 10 or later versions have an in-built GIF keyboard, making it super easy to add GIFs. iPhone text GIFs are readily accessible from GIF keyboards.

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your iPhone, click on the iMessage app to open it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="open iMessage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click on the contact you want to send the GIF to from the list. If you have not previously sent a message to the contact, at the top right corner, click the Write icon represented as a square with a pencil, then enter the name of the contact you want to send the GIF to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the contact"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click the Images icon from the menu bar below the new message field. The image icon represents a white magnifying glass in the middle of a pink-colored circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="click the images icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: This pops up a GIF keyboard with the prompt, “Find images.” Browse through the library of GIFs to see recently used or popular GIFs. If you’re looking for a specific GIF, type in a search keyword into the Find images search bar to discover the results of GIFs that best match your request. For example, you may type “Compliments of the season” or “Grumpy,” depending on what you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="enter the search keyword"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Scroll through the different GIFs on your screen to find the one that best fits your message. Click on it to automatically add it to your message in the text field. Peradventure you selected the wrong GIF, hit the small “x” icon at the top right corner of the GIF to delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/iphone-text-gif-6.jpg"
                      alt="select your desired GIF"

                      alt="hit send"
                ></p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="01Modern-Cartoon-Style"><a href="#01Modern-Cartoon-Style" class="headerlink" title="01Modern Cartoon Style"></a>01Modern Cartoon Style</h3><p>This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.</p>
<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Dexter’s Laboratory</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Codename: Kids Next Door</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Gravity Falls</p>
<h3 id="02Realistic-Cartoon-Style"><a href="#02Realistic-Cartoon-Style" class="headerlink" title="02Realistic Cartoon Style"></a>02Realistic Cartoon Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>
<p>Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ugly Americans</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> General Caricataures</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Archer</p>

Modern-day drawings of this style have a lot of shadows and highlights in their character and environment, giving them a relatively new level of complexity.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> My Hero Academia</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sword Art Online</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Attack on Titan</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</p>
<h3 id="04Classic-Manga"><a href="#04Classic-Manga" class="headerlink" title="04Classic Manga"></a>04Classic Manga</h3><p>The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.</p>
<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>
<p>A few examples of classic manga possessing this <strong>cartoon style drawing</strong> are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Oh My Goddess</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Urusei Yatsura</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sailor Moon</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Hellsing</p>
<h3 id="05Chibi-Drawing-Style"><a href="#05Chibi-Drawing-Style" class="headerlink" title="05Chibi Drawing Style"></a>05Chibi Drawing Style</h3><p>The Chibi <strong>Cartoon Drawing Style</strong> mainly focuses on making the characters into a tiny version of themselves as if being compressed or compacted into a small container.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Lucky Star</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bottle Fairy</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Himouto! Umaru-chan</p>

<h3 id="08Mid-20th-Century-Disney"><a href="#08Mid-20th-Century-Disney" class="headerlink" title="08Mid 20th Century Disney"></a>08Mid 20th Century Disney</h3><p>Disney upped their game during the mid 20th century and started working more with live actors, drawing from references, and filming shots before drawing the cartoons.</p>
<p>Some remarkable examples of this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> are</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cinderella</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beauty and the Beast</p>
<h3 id="09Modern-Disney-Drawing-Style"><a href="#09Modern-Disney-Drawing-Style" class="headerlink" title="09Modern Disney Drawing Style"></a>09Modern Disney Drawing Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> is an immediate improvement of the mid-20th 20th drawing style.

<h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Cartoon-You-May-Use-for-Your-Next-Marketing-Project-3"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Cartoon-You-May-Use-for-Your-Next-Marketing-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project"></a>Part 1 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project</h2><p>As I’ve mentioned before, there are various types and styles of cartoon drawings. Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.</p>
<h3 id="01Modern-Cartoon-Style-3"><a href="#01Modern-Cartoon-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="01Modern Cartoon Style"></a>01Modern Cartoon Style</h3><p>This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.</p>
<p>Note that this <strong>cartoon-style drawing’s</strong> main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.</p>
<p>One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>!</p>
<p>This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Powerpuff Girls</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Dexter’s Laboratory</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Codename: Kids Next Door</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Gravity Falls</p>
<h3 id="02Realistic-Cartoon-Style-3"><a href="#02Realistic-Cartoon-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="02Realistic Cartoon Style"></a>02Realistic Cartoon Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people’s photographs.</p>
<p>You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!</p>
<p>Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Ugly Americans</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> General Caricataures</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Archer</p>
<h3 id="03Modern-Anime-3"><a href="#03Modern-Anime-3" class="headerlink" title="03Modern Anime"></a>03Modern Anime</h3><p>This style tends to be more complex, primarily seen in drawings where the characters seem to be in motion, like in comic books. Modern-day drawings of this style have a lot of shadows and highlights in their character and environment, giving them a relatively new level of complexity.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> My Hero Academia</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sword Art Online</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Attack on Titan</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</p>
<h3 id="04Classic-Manga-3"><a href="#04Classic-Manga-3" class="headerlink" title="04Classic Manga"></a>04Classic Manga</h3><p>The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.</p>
<p>Generally, this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.</p>
<p>A few examples of classic manga possessing this <strong>cartoon style drawing</strong> are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Oh My Goddess</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Urusei Yatsura</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Sailor Moon</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Hellsing</p>
<h3 id="05Chibi-Drawing-Style-3"><a href="#05Chibi-Drawing-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="05Chibi Drawing Style"></a>05Chibi Drawing Style</h3><p>The Chibi <strong>Cartoon Drawing Style</strong> mainly focuses on making the characters into a tiny version of themselves as if being compressed or compacted into a small container.</p>
<p>Examples of where this drawing style is used:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lucky Star</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bottle Fairy</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Himouto! Umaru-chan</p>
<h3 id="06The-Simpsons-Cartoon-Drawing-Style-3"><a href="#06The-Simpsons-Cartoon-Drawing-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="06The Simpsons Cartoon Drawing Style"></a>06The Simpsons Cartoon Drawing Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> is widely famous. Though this style has undergone some evolution throughout the years, the main features remained constant! That is to say, the yellow bodies and big and white sphere-like eyes remained.</p>
<h3 id="07Classic-Disney-3"><a href="#07Classic-Disney-3" class="headerlink" title="07Classic Disney"></a>07Classic Disney</h3><p>This drawing style was a staple for years, though this drawing style has had an evolutionary cartoon drawing style over the years.</p>
<h3 id="08Mid-20th-Century-Disney-3"><a href="#08Mid-20th-Century-Disney-3" class="headerlink" title="08Mid 20th Century Disney"></a>08Mid 20th Century Disney</h3><p>Disney upped their game during the mid 20th century and started working more with live actors, drawing from references, and filming shots before drawing the cartoons.</p>
<p>Some remarkable examples of this <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> are</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Alice in Wonderland</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cinderella</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beauty and the Beast</p>
<h3 id="09Modern-Disney-Drawing-Style-3"><a href="#09Modern-Disney-Drawing-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="09Modern Disney Drawing Style"></a>09Modern Disney Drawing Style</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> is an immediate improvement of the mid-20th 20th drawing style. This cartoon style is brighter, more detailed, and more complex generally.</p>
<p>Although Disney has stopped creating 2D cartoon drawings, there are still some examples of this more refined art style:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Princess and the Frog</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Lilo and Stitch</p>
<h3 id="10Old-Cartoon-Drawing-Style-3"><a href="#10Old-Cartoon-Drawing-Style-3" class="headerlink" title="10Old Cartoon Drawing Style"></a>10Old Cartoon Drawing Style</h3><p>This drawing style is mostly in black and white format, with very high contrast body parts. The features of this style are having short bodies and long limbs. Sometimes, this type of drawing is referred to as Noodle drawing because the character’s body moves as if there are no bones in their body.</p>
<p>Some examples of this <strong>cartoon drawing</strong> <strong>style</strong> include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mickey Mouse</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Betty Boop</p>
<h3 id="11South-Park-3"><a href="#11South-Park-3" class="headerlink" title="11South Park"></a>11South Park</h3><p>South Park <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> is aptly geometric and has little depth. Shadows or highlights in this cartoon-style are rare. The colors are pretty solid and clean.</p>
<h3 id="12Chrono-Trigger-Dragon-Ball-Akira-Toriyama-3"><a href="#12Chrono-Trigger-Dragon-Ball-Akira-Toriyama-3" class="headerlink" title="12Chrono Trigger&#x2F; Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama)"></a>12Chrono Trigger&#x2F; Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama)</h3><p>Akira Toriyama’s <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> characterizes having big and almost rectangular eyes and a lot of geometric shapes and definitions in the muscles.</p>
<h3 id="13Crayon-Shin-Chan-3"><a href="#13Crayon-Shin-Chan-3" class="headerlink" title="13Crayon Shin-Chan"></a>13Crayon Shin-Chan</h3><p>This <strong>cartoon-style drawing</strong> is effortless. An exciting aspect of this style is that it doesn’t mind pushing the limits of the character.</p>
<p>The lines generally are thin, and the eyes are prominent in black and white colors.</p>
<h3 id="14Betty-Boop-3"><a href="#14Betty-Boop-3" class="headerlink" title="14Betty Boop"></a>14Betty Boop</h3><p> Betty Boop’s <strong>cartoon drawing style</strong> possesses contrasting black and white colors. Fragile lines with the characters contain a very high amount of black shapes.</p>
<h3 id="15Adventure-Time-3"><a href="#15Adventure-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="15Adventure Time"></a>15Adventure Time</h3><p>Adventure Time’s art is incredibly geometric, and its characters are nearly boneless, making it a more current example of a cartoon drawing style.</p>
<p>More fluid animation is possible as a result of this. The art is also quite brilliant, with vibrant hues that leap off the screen.</p>
<p>Aside from that, the characters’ eyes are usually tiny (with a few exceptions), and the lines are skinny.</p>
