There are obvious reasons to the fact that anyone would prefer watching a GIF over a video, irrespective of its length. Some major ones that make it quite annoying to watch videos include the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> To begin with, you need to turn the video on and off, depending on your choice of watching a video or surfing through stories and feeds, failing which you get to hear additional sounds through your feed from the already running video. You further need to stop the music or go for a volume control in case you are not interested to watch the video.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Most of the videos you run turn up to be irrelevant or uninteresting through the middle, but you don’t have a choice to make bit adjustments. If however possible, the method is not quite convenient. You may need to visit a different site in case you run a video that is not integrated with webpage of your searched content, wait for the portal’s interface to load or watch an advertisement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> GIFs, on the other hand, do not require pausing or turning off, and run automatically. You also don’t need to mute any sounds. These ensure to-the-point message delivery and don’t divert your attention from the primary content you visit the webpage for.</p>
