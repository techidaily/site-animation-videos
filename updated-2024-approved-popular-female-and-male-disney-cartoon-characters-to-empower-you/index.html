However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg"
                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-12"><a href="#Pros-12" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>

<h5 id="Cons-12"><a href="#Cons-12" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>

<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-13"><a href="#Pros-13" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-13"><a href="#Cons-13" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-14"><a href="#Pros-14" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-14"><a href="#Cons-14" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

                      alt="Cartoon Lens on Snapchat"
                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

                ></p>
<p>Again, we’re moving towards a different kind of animation style with this next filter from Snapchat, but the Comics Style filter does have its own promises of fun as well Especially for those who are long-time fans of American comics (or, even, your average modern-day Avengers fan)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>
<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-1" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It’s also a fun way of engaging with the anime community</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-2"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg"
                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-24"><a href="#Pros-24" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-24"><a href="#Cons-24" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-25"><a href="#Pros-25" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-25"><a href="#Cons-25" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Anime Filter from TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-26"><a href="#Pros-26" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>

<h5 id="Cons-26"><a href="#Cons-26" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

                      alt="Anime Eyes lens"
                ></p>
<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

                ></p>
<p>This next animation filter pick of ours brings us back to Snapchat It’s called the <strong>Cartoon</strong> lens. And, just like our initial picks, it will change your pictures to that of a cartoon This one is closer to the cartoon-style popular around the 2000s (think Frozen &amp; Tangled)</p>

Which includes:</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones</strong></p>
<p>The anime filter’s inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 2: Hair Style</strong></p>
<p>Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories</strong></p>
<p>Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won’t translate for you either, unfortunately</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn’t stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary</p>

However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting <strong>anime filters</strong> in the market:</p>
<h3 id="0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-3"><a href="#0112-Anime-Filters-to-Turn-Yourself-into-an-Anime-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character"></a>0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character</h3><p><strong>Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called <strong>Anime Style Realistic</strong> This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories</p>
<h5 id="Pros-36"><a href="#Pros-36" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.</p>
<p>Works with most skin tones.</p>
<p>Better hair&#x2F;accessory integration.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-36"><a href="#Cons-36" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The style is more realistic than anime.</p>
<p>It is not available anywhere else; you’ll need to be on Snapchat to use it.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload anime filter video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called <strong>Cartoon Style</strong> This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo &amp; Stitch, etc.), but it doesn’t make it any less fun</p>
<h5 id="Pros-37"><a href="#Pros-37" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>FREE Snapchat lens.</p>
<p>Works with all skin tones.</p>
<p>Works with accessories.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-37"><a href="#Cons-37" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>More of a cartoon animated style than anime.</p>
<p>Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.</p>
<p>Not great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes</p>
<p><strong>Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn’t have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-38"><a href="#Pros-38" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Free Chinese TikTok filter.</p>
<p>Great at capturing motion.</p>
<p>Chinese animated drawing style.</p>
<h5 id="Cons-38"><a href="#Cons-38" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.</p>
<p>Not the best with skin tones.</p>
<p>It doesn’t use the classic Japanese-animation style.</p>
<p>This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before’ and ‘after’ (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.</p>

<p>This next filter is the first unofficial <strong>anime filter</strong> on this list. It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn’t animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes’ that you can use as a semi-<strong>animated profile picture maker</strong> (free)</p>

It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png"
                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"
                      alt="Canva page animations"
                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video"><a href="#2-3-Video" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-1"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-1"><a href="#2-1-Image-1" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-2-Text-1"><a href="#2-2-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video-1"><a href="#2-3-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.</p>
<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>

This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-3"><a href="#2-1-Image-3" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Canva page animations"
                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text-3"><a href="#2-2-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video-3"><a href="#2-3-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>

This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg"
                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg"
                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg"
                      alt="draw a circle"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg"
                      alt="draw the eyes"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg"
                      alt="draw the cheeks and wings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg"
                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg"
                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="outline the character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit’s eyes and nose.</p>
<p>Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings</strong></p>
<p>Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It’s OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.</p>
<p>Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Draw the legs</strong></p>
<p>Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don’t yank on the pencil too hard!</p>
<p>Your cartoon rabbit’s shape is now plainly evident.</p>

                      alt="draw the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Draw the mouth</strong></p>
<p>Let’s focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.</p>

                      alt="draw the mouth"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Outline the contours</strong></p>
<p>Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot’s outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.</p>
<p>As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.</p>
<p>Erase and Shade (Step 8)</p>

                      alt="outline the contours"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Outline the Character</strong></p>
<p>Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don’t have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: Erase and Shade</strong></p>
<p>Remove everything that isn’t required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.</p>
<p>I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit’s body if you’re using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.</p>

<p>You have to be free with yourself and try to create <strong>cartoon sketch drawings</strong> of characters that you love.</p>
<p>The more it’s about something you love, the better you get at it.</p>
<p>Here’s a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or <strong>sketch cartoon drawing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Draw a circle</strong></p>
<p>Draw a circle and a “noodle” shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.</p>
<p>The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.</p>
