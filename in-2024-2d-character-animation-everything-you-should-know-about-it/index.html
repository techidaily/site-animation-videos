It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life"><a href="#02Observe-real-life" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>

<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?</h2><p><strong>2D animation</strong> is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life-1"><a href="#02Observe-real-life-1" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key-1"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key-1" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important-1"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important-1" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-1"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>

<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-1"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>

It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>

For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life-2"><a href="#02Observe-real-life-2" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>

<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important-2"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important-2" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development.

<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-3"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-4"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-4" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and <strong>animation cartoons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Before you start learning 3d animation and create <strong>cartoon photos,</strong> ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>

<p>As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.</p>
<p>Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the <strong>animation</strong> process;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Forgetting the ‘why’ factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Over-animating a scene</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Not giving your viewers time to take it in</p>
<p><strong>Forgetting the why:</strong>  In a <strong>animation cartoon,</strong> every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your <strong>cartoon background</strong> is there for a specific reason.</p>
<p>You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won’t find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don’t add up.</p>
<p>Your characters don’t just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.</p>
<p>While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.</p>
<p><strong>Over-animating a scene:</strong> This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.</p>
<p>Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.</p>
<p>You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>Not giving your viewers time to take it in:</strong> This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-6"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-6" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and <strong>animation cartoons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Before you start learning 3d animation and create <strong>cartoon photos,</strong> ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.</p>

<p>Before you delve into the profession of creating <strong>3d cartoon filters</strong>, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It’s not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let’s first understand what 3d animations mean.</p>
<p>Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.</p>
<p>This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful <strong>3d animation cartoons</strong>, including what to expect as a 3d animator.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-3D-Animation-And-The-Process-of-3D-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?</strong></h2><p>animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.</p>
<p>It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.</p>
<p>Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.</p>
<p>The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Modeling</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Layout and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Rendering</p>
<p>Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.</p>
<p>Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set&#x2F;scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.</p>
<p>Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client’s requirements or set goals.</p>
<p>Creating <strong>cartoon background images</strong> or any other form of <strong>animations</strong> is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.</p>
<p>The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-the-difference-between-2d-animation-and-3d-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?</strong></h2><p>Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. <strong>animation</strong> is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn <strong>animation,</strong> you need to understand the distinction between these two.</p>
<p>animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.</p>
<p><strong>3d</strong> animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.</p>
<p>animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.</p>
