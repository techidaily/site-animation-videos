<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Custom-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-Work"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Custom-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Custom Whiteboard Animation Videos Work"></a>Part 1 Why Custom Whiteboard Animation Videos Work</h2><p>The whiteboard animation video is an explainer video used to sell a product or describe a system. These animation videos are incredibly effective in communicating complex ideas and boosting attention and retention for your audience. A custom whiteboard animation video is a do-it-yourself video that does not require a template, but you need to start from scratch. Here are top reasons why you need a custom whiteboard animation video to work:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="custom whiteboard animation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When you want to describe a complex, highly technical, or intricate idea, product, or system, a custom whiteboard animated video will help you out. The more detailed an explanation is, the harder it is to focus, and people often get bored during the description.

<h2 id="Part-3-6-of-the-Best-Animated-Logos"><a href="#Part-3-6-of-the-Best-Animated-Logos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 6 of the Best Animated Logos"></a>Part 3 6 of the Best Animated Logos</h2><h3 id="01Mastercard"><a href="#01Mastercard" class="headerlink" title="01Mastercard"></a>01Mastercard</h3><p>Mastercard is one of the first companies to use animated logos. The logo is simply fantastic due to the meaning it conveys without any complex animation. The animated logo involves the traditional venn diagram logo of mastercard morphing into several objects. These objects include everything from food to groceries to luxurious products. It basically includes the various kinds of commodities people buy using mastercards.</p>
<h3 id="02Burger-king"><a href="#02Burger-king" class="headerlink" title="02Burger king"></a>02Burger king</h3><p>Another popular brand that uses animated logos is the american fast food giant, burger king. The logo is not highly flashy like we see in mastercard. However, the animated logo does obviously look more attention seeking than the conventional static logo. The logo shows the stacking of the different elements of the logo one by one over each other. This resembles the process of making a burger.</p>
<h3 id="03Fedex"><a href="#03Fedex" class="headerlink" title="03Fedex"></a>03Fedex</h3><p>Another logo that would classify as a flashy animated logo is the fedex logo. Initially, fedex had experimented with several logos before sticking to the arrow logo which continues even today. The animated logo involves an arrow making the letter “Fedex” with its trajectory and then finally settling in between letters X and E. The logistics giant delivers couriers from one corner of the world to another, and the arrow symbolizes exactly that!</p>
<h3 id="04Flickr"><a href="#04Flickr" class="headerlink" title="04Flickr"></a>04Flickr</h3><p>Flickr is a popular stock image and video hosting platform. Anyone can use the stock images and videos in their content. The logo starts with a blue and pink dot initially. These dots later expand in a whirlpool like motion. The logo starts off with the static logo before it expands. The idea is to show that the online stock image portal goes beyond limits and has every picture and video you’d need</p>
<h3 id="05Bundle"><a href="#05Bundle" class="headerlink" title="05Bundle"></a>05Bundle</h3><p>Bundle is a popular app that offers its users rewards upon shopping from selected stores. These stores have an alliance with bundle and upon shopping from them, users seek reward points on the bundle app. The animated logo starts of with a pink screen which later converges to become a large “B” wrapped with a gifting ribbon. Although, the logo is pretty simple it does an amazing job at explaining the brand’s MSP and attracts customers.</p>
<h3 id="06Google"><a href="#06Google" class="headerlink" title="06Google"></a>06Google</h3><p>The logo of google has evolved over the years. Google is almost synonymous to attractive logos and it comes up with attractive new logos every now and then.

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form.

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>
