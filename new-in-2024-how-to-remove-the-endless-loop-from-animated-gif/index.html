How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

How To Stop A GIF From Looping?"></a>1. How To Stop A GIF From Looping?</h4><p>Even though GIFs can be saved as infinite loops, this isn’t a mandatory option, as most GIF editors enable you to choose if you want a GIF to be a loop or not. Import a GIF into the editor you are using and then make sure that the Remove Loop option is selected.</p>
<p>This will effectively stop the GIF file from replaying once it reaches the end, so you can proceed to export the GIF from the editor. Keep in mind that some GIF editors don’t allow you to set the Loop count and leaving this box empty will create an infinite loop.</p>

All you need to do in order to set the loop count for a GIF is import it into a GIF editor and click the Edit GIF option.</p>
<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

<p>You will see the loop count box, among other options so you can simply insert the value you want and confirm the changes you’ve made. Afterward, you should export the GIF you edited and it will have the loop as many times as you specified.</p>

<h3 id="012D-Animation"><a href="#012D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="012D Animation"></a>012D Animation</h3><p>animations are trendy <strong>cartoon styles.</strong> This style of animation needs no introduction. This type of <strong>anime cartoon style</strong> was produced by Walt Disney. The most exciting features of the images were that they had only two dimensions: height and width.</p>
<p>Even though several people suggested that 2D <strong>art styles cartoon</strong> were invented during the early twentieth century. Back then, it was not much popular; Walt Disney made these <strong>cartoon styles</strong> famous. Example:</p>

<h3 id="02Traditional-Animation"><a href="#02Traditional-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Traditional Animation"></a>02Traditional Animation</h3><p>As the name suggests, traditional Animation is an <strong>old cartoon art style.</strong> These cartoon styles were first seen in the year 1877. Emil Reynaud discovered a new tool for demonstrating objects that are moving. In this type of Animation, all the images are drawn manually on paper with a pencil. This method of making <strong>cartoon styles</strong> is time-consuming. However, later computer applications and programs were developed, making this task much easier and more efficient. Example:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Animation"><a href="#03Animation" class="headerlink" title="03Animation"></a>03Animation</h3><p>animation <strong>cartoon styles</strong> came into existence with graphics and visual software development. The first 3D dimensional image was created in the year 1972. However, an attempt to make 3D Animation was made in 1961. Nowadays, 3D Animation is a widely used animation style. It is used in the entertainment industry and medical imaging to adequately explain the body and organisms. Example:</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="04Flipbook-Animation"><a href="#04Flipbook-Animation" class="headerlink" title="04Flipbook Animation"></a>04Flipbook Animation</h3><p>In flipbook animation, each frame is drawn on each notebook page. After drawing all the frames is complete, turn the pages quickly. When the pages are turned quickly, it seems to be a moving video because of the different frames drawn on each page. Example:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="flipbook animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Clay-Animation"><a href="#05Clay-Animation" class="headerlink" title="05Clay Animation"></a>05Clay Animation</h3><p>This animation method turns out to be very funny after it is completed. This method of Animation is quite tricky. In this animation method, the characters are made out of clay at first, and then the movements are recorded in a camera. These movements are then made smooth and compiled like a video with different scenes using the software. The main audience for this kind of Animation is children. Example:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="06Typography-Animation"><a href="#06Typography-Animation" class="headerlink" title="06Typography Animation"></a>06Typography Animation</h3><p>Typography animation is also called kinetic typography. This style of Animation is text animation. This method was originated in the year 1899. Back then, this Animation was not much popular.

The procedures are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can take references from real-life objects.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the Animation we see here has been taken from real-life references, be it a cat, car, house, etc. So, to develop the <strong>cartoon styles,</strong> you can take references from real-life objects. You can also search for a particular characteristic in things you won’t use as your reference. If you want to draw a cat, you can use a living cat as your reference.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can copy and try to make Animation like your favorite animator.</strong></p>
<p>If you use this method, this will help you improve your skill. No animation is 100% real, no matter what kind of Animation it is or who is creating it. However, you cannot keep on making animations like your favorite animator because you will not be able to find your <strong>anime art styles</strong> and skills.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can create an animated character of your own.</strong></p>
<p>After taking your reference from real-life objects and knowing about the animation styles and the basic principles of Animation, you can create your animated character. If you create your character, keeping all the skills and techniques in mind, you can develop outstanding animation styles.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>To develop your cartoon style, you need to practice drawing regularly.</strong></p>
<p>To get s grasp this whole process of Animation, you need to draw and practice <strong>different cartoon art styles.</strong> You can draw anything you like, or you don’t like on paper or on a drawing tablet. You can also color sketchbooks to improve your skills in Animation.</p>
<p>You can use Filmora to make cartoon videos and, at the same time, make cartoon videos of normally captured videos. These cartoon videos can be compiled into one video. You can use this video to edit different types of videos. Filmora has a user-friendly interface that can help you create your cartoon video effortlessly.</p>

These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.</p>
<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.</p>
<p>Then they’re either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs’ that you can share with clients and partners alike</p>

However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> has only continued to grow over the years, we’ve also included this section on the many benefits of <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors</p>
<h3 id="01Detailed-Construction-Requirements-2"><a href="#01Detailed-Construction-Requirements-2" class="headerlink" title="01Detailed Construction Requirements"></a>01<strong>Detailed Construction Requirements</strong></h3><p>As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong>. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.</p>

<h3 id="02Complete-Visual-Touring-2"><a href="#02Complete-Visual-Touring-2" class="headerlink" title="02Complete Visual Touring"></a>02<strong>Complete Visual Touring</strong></h3><p>Of course, outside of construction parameters, there’s also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.</p>

A <strong>3D Architectural Animation</strong> shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that’s important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there’s any.)</p>

Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full</p>
<p>Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished’ property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.</p>

<h3 id="05Customer-Reassurance-Boost-2"><a href="#05Customer-Reassurance-Boost-2" class="headerlink" title="05Customer Reassurance Boost"></a>05<strong>Customer Reassurance Boost</strong></h3><p>Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It’s quite relieving, as we’re certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.</p>

If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you’ve got the look right this time around</p>
<p>No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.</p>

<h3 id="01VisEngine-2"><a href="#01VisEngine-2" class="headerlink" title="01VisEngine"></a>01<strong>VisEngine</strong></h3><p>The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is “VisEngine.” They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you’re curious as to the look of their finished <strong>architectural animations</strong>, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out</p>
<h3 id="02Exodo-Animation-Studios-2"><a href="#02Exodo-Animation-Studios-2" class="headerlink" title="02Exodo Animation Studios"></a>02<strong>Exodo Animation Studios</strong></h3><p>“Exodo Animation Studios” is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They’ve had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI</p>
<h3 id="03Promoshin-2"><a href="#03Promoshin-2" class="headerlink" title="03Promoshin"></a>03<strong>Promoshin</strong></h3><p>Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn’t mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they’ve worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)</p>
<h3 id="04ZOA-Studio-2"><a href="#04ZOA-Studio-2" class="headerlink" title="04ZOA Studio"></a>04<strong>ZOA Studio</strong></h3><p>ZOA Studio brings us back to <strong>Architecture Animation</strong> services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it’s a great resource for those looking for inspiration)</p>
<h3 id="05Studio-Aiko-2"><a href="#05Studio-Aiko-2" class="headerlink" title="05Studio Aiko"></a>05<strong>Studio Aiko</strong></h3><p>Again, this next studio, called “Studio Aiko” is usually better known for its regular 3D Animation work. However, that doesn’t mean that their <strong>architectural animations</strong> are any lesser in quality They produce very high-quality work fit for any kind of media platform. Making it a fitting solution for many professional architects</p>
<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-2"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-2" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Animations are now a staple for real estate projects.
