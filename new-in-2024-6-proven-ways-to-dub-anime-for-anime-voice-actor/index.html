<p>Watching anime is one thing majority of the world has come to appreciate. Their engaging storylines, their emotional endings, and hooks, it’s pretty difficult not to like one unless, of course, it’s time for subtitling. Reading subtitles can be stressful and strenuous so most persons just prefer dubbed animes. Dubbed animes are those animes whose voiceovers have been changed to a more preferred language, usually English. Who wouldn’t want to watch their favorite anime dubbed in their language? With great anime voice actors becoming rampant, it’s now easy to get a dubbed version of your favorite anime movies.</p>

<h2 id="6-Ways-To-Dub-Anime-For-You"><a href="#6-Ways-To-Dub-Anime-For-You" class="headerlink" title="6 Ways To Dub Anime For You"></a>6 Ways To Dub Anime For You</h2><p>So, what if you want to become an anime voice actor so that you can start dubbing? That would be awesome, wouldn’t it? It’s not exactly very easy but it’s also not too hard to achieve. The following steps will help you master how to dub animes.</p>
<h3 id="1-Be-An-Anime-Fan-Know-The-Anime-Culture"><a href="#1-Be-An-Anime-Fan-Know-The-Anime-Culture" class="headerlink" title="1. Be An Anime Fan (Know The Anime Culture)"></a>1. Be An Anime Fan (Know The Anime Culture)</h3><p>To be able to do something, you have to understand how that thing works. Before you can become a good anime voice actor, you have to actually understand the anime culture. How do animes usually set up for particular genres? Study the storylines, the hooks, the emotion required for different kinds of scenes. You need to actually know your stuff before you can even start thinking about dubbing any anime. Don’t ever decide to become an anime voice actor if you don’t like animes. Most of the scenes may appear silly to you not to talk of the vocabulary which may just sound weird and annoying to one who is not a fan.</p>
<h3 id="2-Train-Your-Voice-Regularly"><a href="#2-Train-Your-Voice-Regularly" class="headerlink" title="2. Train Your Voice Regularly"></a>2. Train Your Voice Regularly</h3><p>The next thing you need to do when you’re trying to become an anime voice actor is to train your voice. One thing is to use your natural voice, another thing is to tweak your voice to suit a role. Of course, that won’t come cheap. You should be able to learn and master how to use your voice on demand. Train your voice to sound the way you want, consistently. This is very important because, during dubbing, you’re going to get lines that require you to speak for two or more minutes.</p>
<h3 id="3-Practice-Anime-Voice-Acting-Daily-Set-Up-A-Home-Studio"><a href="#3-Practice-Anime-Voice-Acting-Daily-Set-Up-A-Home-Studio" class="headerlink" title="3. Practice Anime Voice Acting Daily (Set Up A Home Studio)"></a>3. Practice Anime Voice Acting Daily (Set Up A Home Studio)</h3><p>This is almost the same as training your voice. Practicing to be a voice actor comes with a lot of demands, you may need to set up a home studio. Scratch that! You actually need to set up a home studio, this will help you successfully practice your voicing on various animes. You can easily pick any of your favorite anime and start dubbing it, to see how your voice would sound and if you’d be able to match a level of consistency.</p>

                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"

<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save image photoshop"
