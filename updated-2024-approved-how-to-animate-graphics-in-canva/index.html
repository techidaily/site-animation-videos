                ></p>
<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-2.png"
                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animating Images in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva"><a href="#2-3-How-do-you-add-music-to-animation-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?"></a>2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?</h3><p>Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva"><a href="#2-4-How-do-you-animate-video-in-Canva" class="headerlink" title="2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?"></a>2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?</h3><p>Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>

                      alt="Video Animation in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>

<p>You can choose to animate an existing design. With a few minor edits, you can have a polished and sophisticated post that’s bound to draw viewer attention and earn you kudos.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.</p>
<p>The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-2-Make-A-Moving-Graphic-In-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva"></a>Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva</h2><p>Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-2"><a href="#2-1-How-to-animate-text-in-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="2.1 How to animate text in Canva?"></a>2.1 How to animate text in Canva?</h3><p>With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.</p>
<p>You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the “Animate” option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animating Text in Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to “animate,” you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.</p>
<p>In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.</p>
<p>Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva-2"><a href="#2-2-How-do-you-animate-a-picture-in-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?"></a>2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?</h3><p>Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.</p>

<p>Users can simply upload their photos. Choose a stock image or upload an image through your photo gallery to use in your design. You can also choose to use “frames,” which are available under the “Elements” tab in Canva.</p>
<p>Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.</p>

The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.</p>
<p>One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.</p>
<p>Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.</p>
<p>Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.</p>

With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.</p>
<p>You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.</p>
<p>Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.</p>
<p>This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.</p>
<p>Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.</p>

<h4 id="Target-Audience"><a href="#Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Target Audience"></a>Target Audience</h4><p>Making animation videos about the target audience is essential, but it doesn’t necessarily mean making videos only for them.

<h4 id="Market"><a href="#Market" class="headerlink" title="Market"></a>Market</h4><p>Video promotion is the last but not least, step! You must know the ideas to market your videos before even starting the creation. The market can be Instagram or any other social media platform where you get a high presence of potential customers.

<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>

Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can proceed to include the image zoom and camera pan features within your project by clicking on the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option. You can further, modify the preset durations of transitions, effects and photos in the ‘Editing’ tab itself before adding them to the editor timeline.

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>When all the images and videos have been added, proceed to arrange them in the desired order of appearance in the slideshow, followed by adjusting their screen time and play durations through any of the methods explained above.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Post the timeline adding of a transition, you can double click on the same to reach the ‘Transition Setting Window’, where you are allowed to customize the play duration and select its ‘Transition Mode’. Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Overlays and Filters for an Improvised Colour Scheme</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Record Voiceovers and Create Soundtracks</strong></p>

The ‘Record Audio’ icon pops up and you now need to select a microphone to be used in the recording process. When you are ready, tap the ‘Record’ button to let the recording begin.</p>

<p>You can now see your voice recording appear in the ‘Media’ tab with the previously imported media files, ready to be placed within the audio track of the project timeline. Filmora’s audio library is a storehouse of free access music and audio effects. To add one to your slideshow, navigate and click on the ‘Audio’ tab to select from the extensive Rock, Young &amp; Bright, Electronic, etc., music subcategories till you get the perfect match for your presentation.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the music tracks, place them one by one on the project timeline and move ahead with adjusting their play durations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Export Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>When you are satisfied with your work, you can export the slideshow directly from Filmora to a number of media sharing platforms. All you need to do is, navigate to and tap the ‘Export’ button in the top right corner of the editor screen and proceed to set the resolution and frame rate, and select the output file format of your created slideshow in the ‘Export Window’ that appears.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>

Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Overlays and Filters for an Improvised Colour Scheme</strong></p>
<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the music tracks, place them one by one on the project timeline and move ahead with adjusting their play durations.</p>

<p>Playing with the words in your mind and weaving them on paper makes a big difference. So, penning a story helps you to recognize the loopholes, the pace, and the character development in your story.</p>
<p>The script gives a person an idea of where your story is based, how does it look or at which time of the day are you talking about, who is talking to whom, and most importantly, the dialogues, what are your story characters say to one another. The script is the essence of creating animation and without it, you cannot resume the process of animation.</p>

It is a sequence of images or pre-visualization of movie shots to understand how exactly the story will unveil, the feel, the look, the camera angles, everything is described like a flowchart.</p>
<p>Storyboarding can be of various types. It may be colorful, it may just an outline, or black and white or something with complete detail. A storyboard must give a complete and close image of what the movie would look like.</p>
<p>The images must be captioned, the movement of the camera must be shown with arrows, and the object and characters must be differentiated from the background with colors.</p>
