<p>A mask is defined as the container for the photos. The logo design maker service provides interesting masks in different shapes to make a stunning and appealing animated logo after effects. You are required to use masks with photos, solid color, and shaded background.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keep it simple and short</p>
<p>Always try to make logo design short and straightforward! If you are using too many effects and colors in the logo design, it turns complex for the audience.</p>
<p><img

<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now.

<h4 id="Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility"><a href="#Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility"></a>Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility</h4><p> Select the Insert tab located at the top of the Powerpoint application.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>
<p> You also have the option to move the GIF image on the page by clicking and dragging the image to the location that you want to place the picture.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Copy-and-Paste"><a href="#Method-2-Copy-and-Paste" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Copy and Paste"></a>Method 2: Copy and Paste</h4><p> A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first. Then, paste your image on the Powerpoint slide by pressing Control + V.</p>
<p> You can also highlight the file name, and then use the drag and drop feature to put your image directly into the Powerpoint slide of your choice.</p>
<h4 id="Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web"><a href="#Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web"></a>Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web</h4><p> The final method is to embed GIF images on the Internet into a Powerpoint slide. You can achieve this function by using the Insert Ribbon’s Pictures icon.</p>
<p> Select Pictures, then write in the image URL directly in the File input box. Then, select Insert. The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.</p>
<p> Here we recommend the method 1 and 2, the method 3 will take a little time while Powerpoint downloading the GIF picture.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>
