<h3 id="01Recommended-Age-1"><a href="#01Recommended-Age-1" class="headerlink" title="01Recommended Age"></a>01Recommended Age</h3><p>Producing something creative with a Stop Motion Animation kit will be a lengthy process that will involve patience and some informational content to use the Kits properly. So while selecting the best Animation Kit, keep in mind the Recommended Age that the company has specified. If the product is for the young generation, the younger ones might have difficulty using the product.</p>
<h3 id="02Different-forms-of-Kits-1"><a href="#02Different-forms-of-Kits-1" class="headerlink" title="02Different forms of Kits"></a>02Different forms of Kits</h3><p>You may check a few of them with different <strong>Features</strong> for the best stop animation kits. However, the significant difference between them is whether they come as complete kits or not. If you buy a complete kit, you will have a camera and other elements with the product.</p>
<p>The only thing you will require other than the entire animation kit would be a computer for software purposes. Moreover, you can also select Kits that do not come with a camera individually.</p>
<p>For this, you must use a smartphone to record the video. Conclusively, the kits present on the market are zoetrope-type kits. However, they are not available with electronics. So you won’t be able to create full films with this one.</p>

<p>Some of the companies out there will create their apps, and it will assist you with different integration procedures, but if the kit you select is not available with a dedicated app. There are a lot of good apps on the market right now that you can go for.

<h3 id="01Recommended-Age-3"><a href="#01Recommended-Age-3" class="headerlink" title="01Recommended Age"></a>01Recommended Age</h3><p>Producing something creative with a Stop Motion Animation kit will be a lengthy process that will involve patience and some informational content to use the Kits properly.

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Canva"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Canva?"></a>Part 1 What is Canva?</h2><p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png"
                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"

                ></p>
<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-5.png"
                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video"><a href="#2-3-Video" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Make-Elements-Move-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-3-Make-Elements-Move-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva"></a>Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva</h2><h3 id="How-To-Arrange-The-Order-Of-An-Animation"><a href="#How-To-Arrange-The-Order-Of-An-Animation" class="headerlink" title="How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?"></a>How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?</h3><p>The brilliant thing about Canva is that you can decide the order you want to create your animation. The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.</p>
<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva"></a>How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva</h3><p>Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-About-Making-Animated-Elements-On-Video"><a href="#Part-4-How-About-Making-Animated-Elements-On-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video"></a>Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video</h2><p>If you’ve decided Canva is not the tool for you, you can choose any video editing software to make your animation.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the tool that can help you level up your content creation. It allows users to increase precision and provides professional video editing options.</p>
<p><strong>AI Portrait – The best feature of Wondershare Filmora for gameplay editing</strong></p>

<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-2"><a href="#2-1-Image-2" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-2-Text-2"><a href="#2-2-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>
<p>The value you insert into the <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> box is based upon the number of frames your video contains.

<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>

<p>Now, when it comes to video marketing, the majority of businesses prefer choosing 2D animations. The reason being 2D animations have a lower production cost and they still offer complete liberty over creativity.

In layman’s terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can’t be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).</p>
<p>Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it’s always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it’s also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You’ll have to be extra cautious while picking through the <strong>best 2D animation studios</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-Time-Does-It-Take-to-Create-a-2D-Animation-Video"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-Time-Does-It-Take-to-Create-a-2D-Animation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Much Time Does It Take to Create a 2D Animation Video?"></a>Part 2 How Much Time Does It Take to Create a 2D Animation Video?</h2><p>Due to their immense popularity in the marketing world, many business owners and marketers want to know how much time it takes to create a 2D animation video. Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated <strong>2D animation company</strong>, you’ll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don’t know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.</p>

In layman’s terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can’t be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).</p>
<p>Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it’s always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it’s also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You’ll have to be extra cautious while picking through the <strong>best 2D animation studios</strong>.</p>

Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated <strong>2D animation company</strong>, you’ll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don’t know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.</p>
