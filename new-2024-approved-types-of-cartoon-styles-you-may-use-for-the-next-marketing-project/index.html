The procedures are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can take references from real-life objects.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the Animation we see here has been taken from real-life references, be it a cat, car, house, etc. So, to develop the <strong>cartoon styles,</strong> you can take references from real-life objects. You can also search for a particular characteristic in things you won’t use as your reference. If you want to draw a cat, you can use a living cat as your reference.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can copy and try to make Animation like your favorite animator.</strong></p>
<p>If you use this method, this will help you improve your skill. No animation is 100% real, no matter what kind of Animation it is or who is creating it. However, you cannot keep on making animations like your favorite animator because you will not be able to find your <strong>anime art styles</strong> and skills.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can create an animated character of your own.</strong></p>
<p>After taking your reference from real-life objects and knowing about the animation styles and the basic principles of Animation, you can create your animated character. If you create your character, keeping all the skills and techniques in mind, you can develop outstanding animation styles.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>To develop your cartoon style, you need to practice drawing regularly.</strong></p>
<p>To get s grasp this whole process of Animation, you need to draw and practice <strong>different cartoon art styles.</strong> You can draw anything you like, or you don’t like on paper or on a drawing tablet. You can also color sketchbooks to improve your skills in Animation.</p>
<p>You can use Filmora to make cartoon videos and, at the same time, make cartoon videos of normally captured videos. These cartoon videos can be compiled into one video. You can use this video to edit different types of videos. Filmora has a user-friendly interface that can help you create your cartoon video effortlessly.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>
