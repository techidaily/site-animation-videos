You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

                      alt="add feet skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 19:</strong> You can color your skeleton drawing or give your shading style after your skeleton drawing is done.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious.

<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                      alt="draw upper half of the legs"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

                      alt="add feet skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>

You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.</p>
<h3 id="01-Smurfette"><a href="#01-Smurfette" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.</p>
<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.</p>
<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat"><a href="#05Top-Cat" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He’s wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he’s making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones’ basic Hanna-Barbera art style.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<h3 id="06Helga-G-Pataki"><a href="#06Helga-G-Pataki" class="headerlink" title="06Helga. G. Pataki"></a>06Helga. G. Pataki</h3><p>Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There’s a lot that’s bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it. Just keep an eye on her head since getting it correct, especially with her rectangle hairdo, can be a little odd.</p>
<p>These are some of the <strong>cool animated characters to draw.</strong></p>

Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.</p>

A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.</p>

Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.</p>

A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.</p>

You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.</p>
<h3 id="01-Smurfette-3"><a href="#01-Smurfette-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles-3"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles-3" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.</p>
<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear-3"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear-3" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.</p>
<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla-3"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla-3" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat-3"><a href="#05Top-Cat-3" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He’s wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he’s making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones’ basic Hanna-Barbera art style.</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<h3 id="06Helga-G-Pataki-3"><a href="#06Helga-G-Pataki-3" class="headerlink" title="06Helga. G. Pataki"></a>06Helga. G. Pataki</h3><p>Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There’s a lot that’s bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it. Just keep an eye on her head since getting it correct, especially with her rectangle hairdo, can be a little odd.</p>
<p>These are some of the <strong>cool animated characters to draw.</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.</p>

You’ll be given a choice in what kind of animations you want to put on your photograph thereafter. And, when the conversion is complete, it’ll be FREE to download and share.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

<p>Photo Cartoon is an <strong>online photo animator</strong> that specifically alters your photos and ‘cartoon-izes’ it (with several effects to choose from as to the specific style that you want). This single-use, while definitely not the most advanced on this list of ours, offers the user an easy way to change the look of their photographs.</p>

<p>With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced <strong>online photo animator</strong> tools. This one works quite simply as well though. Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Create a cartoon version of your images easily and quickly.</p>

<p>We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.</p>

While Photoshop can make animated good morning&#x2F;night GIFs, it is certainly not that user-friendly. That’s why I would recommend using a reliable and friendly application like Wondershare Filmora to meet your requirements. The media-editing tool has an extensive range of assets and offers tons of high-end features to come up with all sorts of inspiring, romantic, or funny good morning&#x2F;night GIFs.</p>
