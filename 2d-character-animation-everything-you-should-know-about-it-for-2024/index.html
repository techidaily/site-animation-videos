<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?</h2><p><strong>2D animation</strong> is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life"><a href="#02Observe-real-life" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-2D-Character-Animation-and-What-Does-2D-Animation-Do-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?"></a>Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?</h2><p><strong>2D animation</strong> is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.</p>
<p>However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.</p>
<p>We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.</p>
<p>With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various <strong>2D character animation</strong> software.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let’s proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within <strong>animation character 2D</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Part-2-2D-Character-Animation-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks</h2><h3 id="01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1"><a href="#01Look-for-a-real-time-reference-1" class="headerlink" title="01Look for a real-time reference"></a>01Look for a real-time reference</h3><p>Using a real-world reference for <strong>2D character animation</strong> can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.</p>
<p>If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.</p>
<h3 id="02Observe-real-life-1"><a href="#02Observe-real-life-1" class="headerlink" title="02Observe real life"></a>02Observe real life</h3><p>You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of <strong>2D character animation</strong> is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.</p>
<p>Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don’t spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.</p>
<h3 id="03Simplicity-is-the-key-1"><a href="#03Simplicity-is-the-key-1" class="headerlink" title="03Simplicity is the key"></a>03Simplicity is the key</h3><p><strong>2D character animation</strong> is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene’s realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.</p>
<h3 id="04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1"><a href="#04Draw-animation-again-and-again-1" class="headerlink" title="04Draw animation again and again"></a>04Draw animation again and again</h3><p>Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can’t complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.</p>
<p>You can’t master the skill of <strong>animation character 2D</strong> quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.</p>
<h3 id="05Feedback-is-important-1"><a href="#05Feedback-is-important-1" class="headerlink" title="05Feedback is important"></a>05Feedback is important</h3><p>Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It’s wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-1"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-1"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2"><a href="#Part-3-An-Ultimate-Guide-to-Create-2D-Character-Animation-Online-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online"></a>Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online</h2><p>Let’s now look at making an illustrated <strong>2D character animation</strong> move on a screen.</p>
<p>While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Download-and-Install-Duik-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Download and Install Duik"></a>01Step 1: Download and Install Duik</h3><p>You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters’ entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.</p>
<p>While this isn’t an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you’ll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/" >Rainbox Laboratory. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Design-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Design Your Character"></a>02Step 2: Design Your Character</h3><p>You need a moving character before you’re able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.</p>
<p>Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character’s limbs.</p>
<p>In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg"
                      alt="draw animation"
                ></p>
<p>Check the character’s joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg"
                      alt="character animation joints"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg"
                      alt="create character rigging"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2"><a href="#06Step-6-Start-Animating-Your-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character"></a>06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character</h3><p>You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Make-and-Import-Your-Character-Artwork-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork"></a>03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork</h3><p>Now, you’ll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.</p>
<p>So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg’s segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg"
                      alt="import character artwork"
                ></p>
<p>To import your character artwork, go to <strong>File</strong>, click the <strong>Import</strong> tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Establish-Initial-Character-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging"></a>04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging</h3><p>Now, the <strong>2D character animation</strong> is almost over by the initial rigging.</p>
<p>Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.</p>
<p>Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It’s simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character’s layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>character animation</strong>.</p>
<p>The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs’ section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg’s upper portion, where it meets the body).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg"
                      alt="character rigging"
                ></p>
<p>Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs’ sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.</p>
<p>It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.</p>
<p>Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the <strong>2D character animation</strong>, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Create-Your-Rig-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Create Your Rig"></a>05Step 5: Create Your Rig</h3><p>Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.</p>
<p>You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.</p>
<p>The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.</p>

First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character’s movement. The character’s legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.</p>
<p>Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can add ‘easing” to the animation via <strong>2D character animation After</strong> <strong>Effects’</strong> <strong>Easy Ease</strong> tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.</p>
<p>It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.</p>
<p>As you practice, you’ll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic <strong>2D animation character design</strong> capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-1"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers&#x2F;creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms &amp; Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg"
                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                      alt="create travel map video with pictramap "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview the Animation</strong></p>
<p>Click the <strong>View Animation</strong> button from the upper-right corner of the page to see the <strong>animated travel map</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<h3 id="Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-2"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-the-Travel-Map-Materials-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials"></a>Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials</h3><p>Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for <strong>animated travel map</strong> preparation:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                      alt="add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>
<p>Once everything is complete, click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the <strong>Preview</strong> window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the <strong>animated travel map</strong> in your preferred format.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                      alt="create travel map video with pictramap "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Animated travel map</strong> videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging <strong>animated travel map</strong> video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Get the Map</p>
<p>The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your preferred web browser</li>
<li>Type <strong>google.com</strong> in the address bar or the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg"
                      alt="Get Travel Maps from Google Map"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Type <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box present on the left side of the <strong>Taskbar</strong></li>
<li>Launch <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Snipping Tool</strong> is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark Out the Map Path</p>
<p>The next step in the process of preparing an <strong>animated travel map</strong> is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, <strong>Microsoft Paint</strong> is used here, and the method is given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click the screenshot you just captured</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Open with</strong> on the context menu, and then click <strong>Paint</strong> from the submenu that appears</li>
<li>Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as <strong>Red</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Sphere</strong> shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Line</strong> tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic</li>
<li>Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong>, and save the marked image with a different name</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Download Some Travel Icons</p>
<p>Another important ingredient in an effective <strong>travel map animation</strong> is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car&#x2F;bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty-free stock photos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at absolutely no cost are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg"
                      alt="create animated travel map in Filmora - import"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Transition</strong> from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the <strong>Erase Slide</strong> transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Preview and Export</strong></p>
<p>Press the <strong>Spacebar</strong> on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the top-center, go to the <strong>Local</strong> tab on the <strong>Export</strong> window, select <strong>MP4</strong> from the formats list in the left, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media</strong></p>
<p>Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.</p>

<p>Next, position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> (<strong>Playhead</strong>) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the <strong>Skimmer</strong> a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing <strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.</p>

<p>Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> from the context menu. On the <strong>Custom Speed</strong> box, drag the <strong>Speed</strong> slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the <strong>Speed</strong> box to get precise tenure. Click <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Animations to Travel Map</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to <strong>Add Animation</strong> from the context menu. Make sure that the <strong>Skimmer</strong> is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the first keyframe</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Move a couple of frames further, and click <strong>Add</strong> one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.</li>
<li>After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.</li>
<li>Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project</strong></p>
<p>Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to <strong>Transition</strong>, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably <strong>Dissolve</strong>, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.</p>

<p>Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to <strong>Titles</strong> on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.</p>

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.</p>
<p>The process to create an <strong>animated travel map</strong> with Pictramap is given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Project</strong></p>
<p>Launch your favorite web browser, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pictramap.com/" >https://www.pictramap.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, click <strong>Create yours now, it’s free</strong>, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the <strong>Dashboard</strong>, enter a name in the field available under the <strong>My Projects</strong> section, and click <strong>Create</strong> to create a new project (the animated map).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute</strong></p>
<p>On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click <strong>Add</strong>. Click the location marker, click the <strong>Travel Mode</strong> icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.</p>

<p>If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.</p>

The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.</p>
<p>So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Multi.dev</strong></p>
<p>Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png"
                      alt="multidev 1"
                ></p>
<p>Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Your First Location</strong></p>
<p>Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.</p>
<p>Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!</p>

                      alt="multidev 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Select Map Themes</strong></p>
<p>All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="multidev 3"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png"
                      alt="multidev 4"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png"
                      alt="multidev 5"
                ></p>
<p>Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>An <strong>animated travel map</strong> plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.</p>
<p>Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.</p>

<p><strong>Below are steps on how to create your 3D animation character:</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Step1-Make-a-Story"><a href="#01Step1-Make-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="01Step1: Make a Story"></a>01Step1: Make a Story</h3><p>Brainstorm and work on the storyboard. Make sure you don’t forget to translate your ideas into visuals by creating a perfect story after brainstorming the idea for the animated topic.</p>

In these steps, you can draw and model the characters differently using the excellent animation software mentioned in this article. During designing, make sure you don’t rush the design texturing. Texture can be according to art’s concept, which you can assign to the model.</p>

All the <strong>3D rigged characters for animation</strong> can move from animators, while 3D models combine with a rigged skeleton in skinning. This step is because it controls the rig, which can easily change the 3D model. Animates the model, which is one of the most critical and time-consuming tasks which involves you adding life to your 3D character. More so, this affects you using a 3D application to ensure that the objects or models adjust according to your need.</p>

<p>Watching anime is one thing majority of the world has come to appreciate. Their engaging storylines, their emotional endings, and hooks, it’s pretty difficult not to like one unless, of course, it’s time for subtitling. Reading subtitles can be stressful and strenuous so most persons just prefer dubbed animes. Dubbed animes are those animes whose voiceovers have been changed to a more preferred language, usually English. Who wouldn’t want to watch their favorite anime dubbed in their language? With great anime voice actors becoming rampant, it’s now easy to get a dubbed version of your favorite anime movies.</p>

<h2 id="6-Ways-To-Dub-Anime-For-You-3"><a href="#6-Ways-To-Dub-Anime-For-You-3" class="headerlink" title="6 Ways To Dub Anime For You"></a>6 Ways To Dub Anime For You</h2><p>So, what if you want to become an anime voice actor so that you can start dubbing? That would be awesome, wouldn’t it? It’s not exactly very easy but it’s also not too hard to achieve. The following steps will help you master how to dub animes.</p>
<h3 id="1-Be-An-Anime-Fan-Know-The-Anime-Culture-3"><a href="#1-Be-An-Anime-Fan-Know-The-Anime-Culture-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Be An Anime Fan (Know The Anime Culture)"></a>1. Be An Anime Fan (Know The Anime Culture)</h3><p>To be able to do something, you have to understand how that thing works. Before you can become a good anime voice actor, you have to actually understand the anime culture. How do animes usually set up for particular genres? Study the storylines, the hooks, the emotion required for different kinds of scenes. You need to actually know your stuff before you can even start thinking about dubbing any anime. Don’t ever decide to become an anime voice actor if you don’t like animes. Most of the scenes may appear silly to you not to talk of the vocabulary which may just sound weird and annoying to one who is not a fan.</p>
<h3 id="2-Train-Your-Voice-Regularly-3"><a href="#2-Train-Your-Voice-Regularly-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Train Your Voice Regularly"></a>2. Train Your Voice Regularly</h3><p>The next thing you need to do when you’re trying to become an anime voice actor is to train your voice. One thing is to use your natural voice, another thing is to tweak your voice to suit a role. Of course, that won’t come cheap. You should be able to learn and master how to use your voice on demand. Train your voice to sound the way you want, consistently. This is very important because, during dubbing, you’re going to get lines that require you to speak for two or more minutes.</p>
<h3 id="3-Practice-Anime-Voice-Acting-Daily-Set-Up-A-Home-Studio-3"><a href="#3-Practice-Anime-Voice-Acting-Daily-Set-Up-A-Home-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Practicing to be a voice actor comes with a lot of demands, you may need to set up a home studio. Scratch that! You actually need to set up a home studio, this will help you successfully practice your voicing on various animes. You can easily pick any of your favorite anime and start dubbing it, to see how your voice would sound and if you’d be able to match a level of consistency.</p>
