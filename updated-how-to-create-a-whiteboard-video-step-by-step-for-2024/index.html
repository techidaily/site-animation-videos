<h2 id="Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video"><a href="#Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?"></a>Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?</h2><p>To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

<h4 id="Step-2-Start-with-the-Storyboard"><a href="#Step-2-Start-with-the-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start with the Storyboard"></a>Step 2: Start with the Storyboard</h4><p>Now you have a script. You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-Create-Images"><a href="#Step-3-Create-Images" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create Images"></a>Step 3: Create Images</h4><p>If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.</p>

Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>

Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?"></a>Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?</h2><p>To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script-3"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-Create-Images-3"><a href="#Step-3-Create-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Create Images"></a>Step 3: Create Images</h4><p>If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.</p>

<h4 id="Step-4-Animate-Those-Images-3"><a href="#Step-4-Animate-Those-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Animate Those Images"></a>Step 4: Animate Those Images</h4><p>Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.</p>

Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.</p>

You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.</p>
<p>By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.</p>
<h4 id="Personalize-the-Images-3"><a href="#Personalize-the-Images-3" class="headerlink" title="Personalize the Images"></a>Personalize the Images</h4><p>Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project.

<h3 id="1-ShoeMint"><a href="#1-ShoeMint" class="headerlink" title="1. ShoeMint"></a>1. ShoeMint</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-4.gif"
                      alt="shoemint"
                ></p>
<p>This cute GIF syncs pretty well with the ShoeMint’s email marketing template’s title – “C’mon, Get Happy!.” You can smile when you see the colorful socks swaying in a carefree manner.</p>
<h3 id="2-Mr-Porter"><a href="#2-Mr-Porter" class="headerlink" title="2. Mr. Porter"></a>2. Mr. Porter</h3><p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-3.gif"
                      alt="mr porter"
                ></p>
<p>This is an animated fireplace in the email marketing newsletter of Mr. Porter. It gives a pretty cozy and warm feel and atmosphere to the entire image, which is what they’re looking for or wandering for with the casual clothes the man is wearing.</p>
<h3 id="3-American-Apparel"><a href="#3-American-Apparel" class="headerlink" title="3. American Apparel"></a>3. American Apparel</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="american apparel"
                ></p>
<p>American Apparel sells “power washed” T-shirts to make them “super soft.”</p>
<p>This critical merit would not attract many users if it weren’t for simulating the animated GIF of the T-shirts getting washed in an imaginary washing machine.</p>
<h3 id="4-Looper"><a href="#4-Looper" class="headerlink" title="4. Looper"></a>4. Looper</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>One of the major motion pictures was Looper, that introduced us to the world’s first “official” GIF movie poster when the film premiered. The clock GIF inside the first O is exclusively creative, and the incredible animated dust effect suggests that both characters are fading away due to the events in the movie.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select Image</strong></p>
<p>Now, choose an image you want to cartoonize.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="select image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Apply Filter-Sharpen</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter to sharpen the image. Select the Gaussian Blur from the Remove drop-down list</p>
<p>Press OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Apply Filter-Stylize</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter, then apply stylization and Oil paint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="apply filter-stylize"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Choose Poster Edges</strong></p>
<p>Choose from the list of effects on the filter gallery, click on Poster Edges and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="choose poster edges"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Blur</strong></p>
<p>It will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 15 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels. This effect gives the skin a considerably smoother and cleaner appearance. Select OK.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Unsharp Mask</strong></p>
<p>You can add some sharpness and increase particular highlights by going to Filter &gt; Sharpen &gt; Unsharp Mask.</p>
<p>Unhide the second Smart Object layer and change its blending mode to Overlay. Then, reduce the layer’s Opacity to 55 percent.</p>
<p>Now, it will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 12 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Apply the Oil paint filter again</strong></p>

<p>Choose the Oil Paint Filter from Filter &gt; Stylize. Select OK.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select Image</strong></p>
<p>Now, choose an image you want to cartoonize.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="select image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Apply Filter-Sharpen</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter to sharpen the image. Select the Gaussian Blur from the Remove drop-down list</p>
<p>Press OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="apply filter-sharpen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Apply Filter-Stylize</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filter, then apply stylization and Oil paint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/photoshop-cartoon-effects-14.jpg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Choose Poster Edges</strong></p>
<p>Choose from the list of effects on the filter gallery, click on Poster Edges and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="choose poster edges"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Blur</strong></p>
<p>It will start to resemble a cartoon, but there’s still more to do, so use the Filter &gt; Blur Menu to add a Surface Blur. Set the Threshold to 15 pixels and the Radius to 12 pixels. This effect gives the skin a considerably smoother and cleaner appearance. Select OK.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Unsharp Mask</strong></p>
<p>You can add some sharpness and increase particular highlights by going to Filter &gt; Sharpen &gt; Unsharp Mask.</p>
<p>Unhide the second Smart Object layer and change its blending mode to Overlay. Then, reduce the layer’s Opacity to 55 percent.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Apply the Oil paint filter again</strong></p>

<p>Choose the Oil Paint Filter from Filter &gt; Stylize. Select OK.</p>
