Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute.

On Moana’s first attempt at setting sails to find Maui, their raft gets damaged, and Pua becomes scared of the sea and Moana’s oar. Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>

<h2 id="Why-use-animation-for-business"><a href="#Why-use-animation-for-business" class="headerlink" title="Why use animation for business?"></a>Why use animation for business?</h2><p>As we have earlier mentioned, animation is the key to attractive branding. According to Smart Insights’ recent article on Video Marketing in 2020, around 92% of marketers feel this an essential part of business strategy. In contrast, 88% of marketers think that video marketing in animation offers them positive ROI.</p>
<p>We can describe to you a list of 5 reasons to use animation for business as follows.</p>
<h4 id="It-is-fun-and-entertaining"><a href="#It-is-fun-and-entertaining" class="headerlink" title="It is fun and entertaining"></a>It is fun and entertaining</h4><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be realistic or accurate. The purpose of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill fun and entertainment. The animation is a way to grab customers’ attention rather than being used as a strict marketing tool. Customers will look over to the story more interesting than the traditional ad system.</p>
<h4 id="Lasting-impression"><a href="#Lasting-impression" class="headerlink" title="Lasting impression"></a>Lasting impression</h4><p>The animated videos for business leave a memorable impression on the current as well as new customers. However, you must be clear about using animation in a way that creatively tells about your business. A story that is too different from the business purpose may not be a good idea to create a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, you must tell about the values you inject in a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the visuals and the information they get from it.</p>
<h4 id="Boosts-conversion-rate"><a href="#Boosts-conversion-rate" class="headerlink" title="Boosts conversion rate"></a>Boosts conversion rate</h4><p>Due to the highly attractive nature of business animation videos, the customer is likely to complete the action as expected by the brand. More than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content rather than getting you the high bounce off rates. So, you should beautifully explain the merits of your service or product to the user in animated videos for business. It’s great if you add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h4 id="Easy-updates"><a href="#Easy-updates" class="headerlink" title="Easy updates"></a>Easy updates</h4><p>Being a potent marketing tool animation for business is a new and updated aspect. It is one of the advanced digital technologies to update messaging and marketing collateral and reflect your business values. The presentation of content with animation appeals to different and new potential audiences cost-effectively and efficiently.</p>
<h4 id="Turns-complex-ideas-into-easy-ones"><a href="#Turns-complex-ideas-into-easy-ones" class="headerlink" title="Turns complex ideas into easy ones"></a>Turns complex ideas into easy ones</h4><p>Dealing with complex ideas or products in the text form can be pretty hard to convey effectively unless you insert animation in the text and make it attractive. After all, complex ideas can’t quickly turn into easy ones.</p>

The process tells you a story mostly by the presentation of someone’s hands. Notably, the whiteboard is to represent the time-lapse or stop motion effect.</p>

<h2 id="What-to-Consider-before-Making-Animated-Business-Videos"><a href="#What-to-Consider-before-Making-Animated-Business-Videos" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider before Making Animated Business Videos?"></a>What to Consider before Making Animated Business Videos?</h2><p>The decision to make animated videos for business could be a tricky task even if you are aware of the importance, as mentioned above, of animation. Merely knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You need to implement the right strategies and know what factors are essential to look for before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those critical points!</p>
<h4 id="Budget"><a href="#Budget" class="headerlink" title="Budget"></a>Budget</h4><p>The budget comes as the top-most factor because you can’t do anything without enough money. So, be ready to invest a fair amount or at least invest in reliable video editing software. However, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, using Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $49.99 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. However, it also depends upon the kind of job and style of business values you want to present in the animation. You have to outsource if it’s expert-level work!</p>
<h4 id="Brand-Positioning"><a href="#Brand-Positioning" class="headerlink" title="Brand Positioning"></a>Brand Positioning</h4><p>Consider your brand positioning! While using the animation for business, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values than mere visuals. They want to know your identity as a brand and your industry. It will help if you incorporate some brand positioning first before deciding to make animation videos for business. What you can do is check the overview of the brand from the customer’s point of view. After that, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C.</p>
<h4 id="Target-Audience"><a href="#Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Target Audience"></a>Target Audience</h4><p>Making animation videos about the target audience is essential, but it doesn’t necessarily mean making videos only for them. The very first question is to ask why you are making such a video. There could be many reasons behind the same, such as gaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a new product or brand.</p>
<h4 id="Market"><a href="#Market" class="headerlink" title="Market"></a>Market</h4><p>Video promotion is the last but not least, step! You must know the ideas to market your videos before even starting the creation. The market can be Instagram or any other social media platform where you get a high presence of potential customers. Furthermore, the video should not be too pushy.</p>

<h4 id="Budget-3"><a href="#Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="Budget"></a>Budget</h4><p>The budget comes as the top-most factor because you can’t do anything without enough money.

<h4 id="Target-Audience-3"><a href="#Target-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="Target Audience"></a>Target Audience</h4><p>Making animation videos about the target audience is essential, but it doesn’t necessarily mean making videos only for them.

<p>Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora’s Media tab. Moreover, you should also import all audio files you would like to use in your project before doing any actual editing. When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.</p>
<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>
<p>The value you insert into the <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn’t let you minimize a project’s frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04.</p>
<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>

Filmora doesn’t let you minimize a project’s frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04.</p>
<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>
