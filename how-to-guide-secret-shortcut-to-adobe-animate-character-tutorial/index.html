<p>Irrespective of your experience with the tool, this <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong> will help you get started and edit visually appealing animated shorts.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?"></a>Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?</h2><h3 id="1-Start-With-a-Script"><a href="#1-Start-With-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="1. Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg"
                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-I-Animate-a-Character-in-Adobe-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?"></a>Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?</h2><h3 id="1-Start-With-a-Script-1"><a href="#1-Start-With-a-Script-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Start With a Script"></a>1. Start With a Script</h3><p>If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It’ll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg"
                      alt="script"
                ></p>
<p>If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you’ll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you’ll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-the-Voiceover-1"><a href="#2-Record-the-Voiceover-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the Voiceover"></a>2. Record the Voiceover</h3><p>The next step in our <strong>Adobe Animate character tutorial</strong> is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg"
                      alt="voice over"
                ></p>
<p>Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character-1"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg"
                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

<h3 id="3-Start-Creating-the-Character-3"><a href="#3-Start-Creating-the-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Start Creating the Character"></a>3. Start Creating the Character</h3><p>At this point in our <strong>Adobe animate character tutorial</strong>, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you’ll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it’ll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.</p>

                      alt="character development in animator"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you’ll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.</p>
<p>If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it’ll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.</p>

<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now. People who use this application make a common mistake of using too many slides with huge amounts of text and that is a major turnoff for the audience. Huge text is seen as a disaster. You should be able to convey an interesting story to your attentive audience without explaining every single detail on your slides for your presentation.

<h4 id="Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility"><a href="#Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility"></a>Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility</h4><p> Select the Insert tab located at the top of the Powerpoint application.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>
<p> You also have the option to move the GIF image on the page by clicking and dragging the image to the location that you want to place the picture.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Copy-and-Paste"><a href="#Method-2-Copy-and-Paste" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Copy and Paste"></a>Method 2: Copy and Paste</h4><p> A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first. Then, paste your image on the Powerpoint slide by pressing Control + V.</p>
<p> You can also highlight the file name, and then use the drag and drop feature to put your image directly into the Powerpoint slide of your choice.</p>
<h4 id="Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web"><a href="#Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web"></a>Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web</h4><p> The final method is to embed GIF images on the Internet into a Powerpoint slide. You can achieve this function by using the Insert Ribbon’s Pictures icon.</p>
<p> Select Pictures, then write in the image URL directly in the File input box. Then, select Insert. The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.</p>
<p> Here we recommend the method 1 and 2, the method 3 will take a little time while Powerpoint downloading the GIF picture.</p>

<p> Microsoft Powerpoint has been on the Internet for quite some time now. People who use this application make a common mistake of using too many slides with huge amounts of text and that is a major turnoff for the audience. Huge text is seen as a disaster. You should be able to convey an interesting story to your attentive audience without explaining every single detail on your slides for your presentation. Using a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GIF <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to explain complicate things or just set it as a background can be much interesting.</p>

<h4 id="Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility-1"><a href="#Method-1-Powerpoint-Picture-Insert-Utility-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility"></a>Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility</h4><p> Select the Insert tab located at the top of the Powerpoint application.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="insert gif to powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p> The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.</p>
<p> You also have the option to move the GIF image on the page by clicking and dragging the image to the location that you want to place the picture.</p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Copy-and-Paste-1"><a href="#Method-2-Copy-and-Paste-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Copy and Paste"></a>Method 2: Copy and Paste</h4><p> A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first. Then, paste your image on the Powerpoint slide by pressing Control + V.</p>
<p> You can also highlight the file name, and then use the drag and drop feature to put your image directly into the Powerpoint slide of your choice.</p>
<h4 id="Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web-1"><a href="#Method-3-Embedding-GIF’s-from-the-web-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web"></a>Method 3: Embedding GIF’s from the web</h4><p> The final method is to embed GIF images on the Internet into a Powerpoint slide. You can achieve this function by using the Insert Ribbon’s Pictures icon.</p>
<p> Select Pictures, then write in the image URL directly in the File input box. Then, select Insert. The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.</p>
<p> Here we recommend the method 1 and 2, the method 3 will take a little time while Powerpoint downloading the GIF picture.</p>

<h2 id="How-You-Can-Develop-a-Cartoon-Style-for-Animation"><a href="#How-You-Can-Develop-a-Cartoon-Style-for-Animation" class="headerlink" title="How You Can Develop a Cartoon Style for Animation"></a>How You Can Develop a Cartoon Style for Animation</h2><p>Anyone can develop new <strong>cartoon styles</strong> by following these simple procedures or habits. The procedures are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can take references from real-life objects.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the Animation we see here has been taken from real-life references, be it a cat, car, house, etc. So, to develop the <strong>cartoon styles,</strong> you can take references from real-life objects. You can also search for a particular characteristic in things you won’t use as your reference. If you want to draw a cat, you can use a living cat as your reference.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can copy and try to make Animation like your favorite animator.</strong></p>
<p>If you use this method, this will help you improve your skill. No animation is 100% real, no matter what kind of Animation it is or who is creating it.

<h2 id="How-You-Can-Develop-a-Cartoon-Style-for-Animation-3"><a href="#How-You-Can-Develop-a-Cartoon-Style-for-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="How You Can Develop a Cartoon Style for Animation"></a>How You Can Develop a Cartoon Style for Animation</h2><p>Anyone can develop new <strong>cartoon styles</strong> by following these simple procedures or habits. The procedures are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can take references from real-life objects.</strong></p>
<p>Most of the Animation we see here has been taken from real-life references, be it a cat, car, house, etc. So, to develop the <strong>cartoon styles,</strong> you can take references from real-life objects. You can also search for a particular characteristic in things you won’t use as your reference. If you want to draw a cat, you can use a living cat as your reference.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can copy and try to make Animation like your favorite animator.</strong></p>
<p>If you use this method, this will help you improve your skill. No animation is 100% real, no matter what kind of Animation it is or who is creating it. However, you cannot keep on making animations like your favorite animator because you will not be able to find your <strong>anime art styles</strong> and skills.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>You can create an animated character of your own.</strong></p>
<p>After taking your reference from real-life objects and knowing about the animation styles and the basic principles of Animation, you can create your animated character. If you create your character, keeping all the skills and techniques in mind, you can develop outstanding animation styles.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>To develop your cartoon style, you need to practice drawing regularly.</strong></p>
<p>To get s grasp this whole process of Animation, you need to draw and practice <strong>different cartoon art styles.</strong> You can draw anything you like, or you don’t like on paper or on a drawing tablet. You can also color sketchbooks to improve your skills in Animation.</p>
<p>You can use Filmora to make cartoon videos and, at the same time, make cartoon videos of normally captured videos. These cartoon videos can be compiled into one video. You can use this video to edit different types of videos. Filmora has a user-friendly interface that can help you create your cartoon video effortlessly.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> I hope you have understood the different types of <strong>anime cartoon styles</strong> by now.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> These methods can help you make the best for your next marketing project.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> These methods are easy, efficient, and efficient. All the aforementioned methods were discovered in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the advancement of technology, the process has become more accessible. However, you can use any <strong>cartoon-style art.</strong></p>
