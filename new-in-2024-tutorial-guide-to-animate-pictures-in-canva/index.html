<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>
