<p>It’s worth noting that people commonly use built-in <strong>OBS animated lower thirds</strong> for the job, but you can also use other editing tools to create custom animations and import them in your OBS Livestream.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about OBS animated lower thirds and their best alternatives you can use in 2022 and beyond.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What are Lower Thirds in Animation?](#Part 1)</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>
<h3 id="01Wirecast"><a href="#01Wirecast" class="headerlink" title="01Wirecast"></a>01Wirecast</h3><p><img

                      alt="wirecast"
                ></p>
<p>Like OBS, Wirecast is a popular video streaming platform that many content creators use to live stream on their social media handles. It also offers a layer-based architecture, which means users can add multiple layers separately and manage them through an easy-to-navigate panel.</p>
<p>One of the key reasons Wirecast is an ideal choice to add <strong>animated lower-third</strong> graphics to your live streams is its built-in collections. The tool already has several ready-to-integrate lower-third animations that one could import into their project without any hassle.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Built-in lower-third graphic templates</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Easy-to-use Interface</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Switch between multiple camera angles with one click</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unlike OBS Studio, Wirecast isn’t available for free</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Wirecast?</strong></p>
<p>Wirecast is a fully functional video streaming platform where you can easily manage all your live streams. Wirecast offers far better functionality than OBS Studio despite having a relatively easy-to-use UI.</p>

                ></p>
<p>vMix is a feature-rich video production software that offers everything one would need to create stunning videos. However, it also has a dedicated live stream manager to manage your live streams, switch between multiple camera angles, and add overlay animations to keep the viewers engaged. Unlike OBS Studio, vMix doesn’t have a layering system, which means you can overlay multiple channels easily.</p>
<p>As far as <strong>OBS animated lower-thirds</strong> are concerned, there are different ways you can add these animations to your live streams. You can either import dedicated PSD files, embed HTML codes, or choose one of the ready-to-use lower-third templates to do the job. In either case, vMix will help you add stunning lower-third animations within a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Full-scale video production software</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Built-in support for audio mixing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add and Manage Multiple Camera Inputs</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you want to relish all the benefits of vMix, you would have to purchase its pro version, which costs $1200. As compared to other available options, vMix is significantly expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend vMix?</strong></p>
<p>vMix is ideal for users who want to upgrade from OBS and can spend $1200 on a live stream manager. It’ll provide everything you need to live stream across different social media platforms.</p>

                      alt="Restream Studio"
                ></p>
<p>Restream Studio is a browser-based live stream tool that offers an easy-to-navigate panel to manage your live streams. Restream is ideal for beginners who don’t want to spend a hefty amount on their live streaming software. With restream, you can upload your brand logos, graphic overlays, and text details and save them in the “Favorites” tab for future use.</p>
<p>This way, whenever you are live streaming, you can directly choose one of these overlays and switch between them easily. The tool also has a dedicated “Hide&#x2F;Show” button that’ll allow you to change the display status of the lower-third animations.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Cross-platform Compatibility</p>

                      alt="Lightstream"
                ></p>

<h3 id="05Adobe-Photoshop"><a href="#05Adobe-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="05Adobe Photoshop"></a>05Adobe Photoshop</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/obs-animated-lower-thirds-alternative-06.jpg"
                      alt="Adobe Photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Before you act surprised, let us clarify that Adobe Photoshop isn’t an alternative to OBS Studio. However, you can use it to create customized overlays and lower-third graphics to add a personal touch to your live streams. Suppose you are already familiar with Photoshop and have been using it for a few years. In that case, it’ll allow you to design personalized text overlays, graphics, animations, and logos for your live streams.</p>
<p>And, once you have successfully designed the lower-third overlays, you can use any of the live stream managers to add them to your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Design custom overlays for your social media live streams</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photoshop has a steep learning curve, and if you are not an experienced designer, you won’t be able to design custom overlays</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend Adobe Photoshop?</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Photoshop is a reliable choice for creators who find the built-in media libraries of a live stream manager limited. With Photoshop, you’ll be able to design custom overlays for your live streams.</p>
<h3 id="06ShareX"><a href="#06ShareX" class="headerlink" title="06ShareX"></a>06ShareX</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/obs-animated-lower-thirds-alternative-07.jpg"
                      alt="ShareX"
                ></p>
<p>ShareX is also an open-source screen recorder and lives stream manager that offers all the OBS features you’ll need to manage your live streams and add multiple lower-third overlays. The only downside of ShareX is that it has a complicated user interface. Even if you have used OBS in the past, you’ll find ShareX’s user interface relatively complex. So, you should only sign up for ShareX if you are comfortable with complex user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Upload and save pictures, videos, logos for lower-third overlays</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Record your entire screen or a specific window</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Assign hotkeys to switch between multiple windows during the Livestream</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The user interface isn’t as friendly as other available options</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Recommend ShareX?</strong></p>
<p>ShareX is an ideal <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> alternative for users who need a free-of-cost solution to manage their live streams.</p>
<h3 id="07Canva"><a href="#07Canva" class="headerlink" title="07Canva"></a>07Canva</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/obs-animated-lower-thirds-alternative-08.jpg"
                      alt="Canva"
                ></p>
<p>Again, Canva doesn’t support live stream management at all. However, like Adobe Photoshop, you can use Canva to create stunning lower-third overlays for your Livestream sessions. The major benefit of using Canva is that it has thousands of pre-made templates that you can import to your design with one click. All these templates are fully customizable - so you’ll be able to design custom lower-third overlays for your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Comparatively less complicated than Adobe Photoshop</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Canva is affordable</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Being a web-based designing tool, you can access Canva on any device</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The premium version of Canva is relatively expensive than its competitors.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>

Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option?

<p>Before you act surprised, let us clarify that Adobe Photoshop isn’t an alternative to OBS Studio. However, you can use it to create customized overlays and lower-third graphics to add a personal touch to your live streams. Suppose you are already familiar with Photoshop and have been using it for a few years. In that case, it’ll allow you to design personalized text overlays, graphics, animations, and logos for your live streams.</p>
<p>And, once you have successfully designed the lower-third overlays, you can use any of the live stream managers to add them to your live streams.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Design custom overlays for your social media live streams</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Photoshop has a steep learning curve, and if you are not an experienced designer, you won’t be able to design custom overlays</p>

                ></p>
<p>ShareX is also an open-source screen recorder and lives stream manager that offers all the OBS features you’ll need to manage your live streams and add multiple lower-third overlays. The only downside of ShareX is that it has a complicated user interface. Even if you have used OBS in the past, you’ll find ShareX’s user interface relatively complex.

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Upload and save pictures, videos, logos for lower-third overlays</p>

                      alt="Canva"
                ></p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Lower-Thirds-in-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?</h2><p>To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.</p>
<p>Let’s say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Set-Up-An-Animated-Lower-Third-In-OBS-Studio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio"></a>Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio</h2><p>So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let’s understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It’s worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an <strong>animated lower third in OBS</strong> studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you’ll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don’t have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.</p>
<p>Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you’ll end up losing potential viewers.</p>
<p>Here’s a YouTube video that’ll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives-3"><a href="#Part-3-8-AMAZING-OBS-Animated-Lower-Thirds-Alternatives-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives"></a>Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives</h2><p>While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don’t have a high-configuration system, you won’t be able to run the tool at all.</p>
<p>So, what’s your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up <strong>OBS animated lower-third</strong> graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.</p>

<p>One of the most useful tricks for marketers is to optimize size of their GIF images by adjusting total number of colours to it. It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.</p>
<p> <strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<p>During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.</p>

<p><strong>Motion Graphics (Key framing)</strong>: Motion graphics focus on making dynamic and exciting presentations of moving text logos and fundamental illustrations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion graphics can be 2D and 3D, and you’ll find them everywhere in news, sporting videos, the news, and other TV productions.</li>
<li>Correct character animation is generally outside the scope of motion graphics, but many core animation principles also apply to motion graphics.</li>
<li>Creating Motion Graphics depends on the plan used since video editing software often have different user interface or settings, but the idea is the same. Motion Graphics usually involves animating texts, pictures, or video clips using keyframing that is tweened to make a smooth motion between frames.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traditional Animation</strong>: This is the classic type of Animation you’re probably most well known with. In the past, animators drew characters frame by frame, and then those pictures were moved onto transparent sheets for painting. That’s where the term animation comes from.</p>
<p>They started scanning drawings into the computer for digital coloring. The important thing is that hand-drawn animators still create their animation frame by frame using the same method and concept as in those old days of paper and cels.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora"></a>How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora</h2><p>Keyframes specify the start or end of a transition in a shot. A series of keyframes can give the semblance of the movement of an object. Keyframes include parameters such as Position, Scale, Opacity, and Rotation. These values can be changed and customized to make animations using keyframing.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> makes it really easy to use. Even learners or novices can use keyframe animation to create extraordinary videos. Plus, the keyframe templates are an added satisfaction. If you have limited time and need a quick fix, using Presets in the Animation tab is your best bet.</p>
<p>For this example, we’ll walk you through using Keyframes on the short video clip to make your Animation using Wondershare Filmora.</p>

<p>Step1 Launch Wondershare Filmora from your system and select New Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-01.png"
                      alt="launch wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Import your selected images. In this case I imported no background images to have a clear view on how key framing works.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-animation-file-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="import animation file filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag or add the image on the Timeline Panel.</p>
<p>In this case I use a dove and a cloud to demo the Motion graphics animation</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/motion-graphics-animation-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="motion graphics animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double click the image then the Animation tab will display. Here, there are available presets, either the latest or the Legacy Animation, as indicated on the display that you can use.</p>
<p>There is also a tab if you want to customize your animations which requires premium account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fade In</li>
<li>Fade Out</li>
<li>Pause</li>
<li>Slide right</li>
<li>Slide up</li>
<li>Vortex In</li>
<li>Vortex Out</li>
<li>Zoom In</li>
<li>Zoom Out</li>
</ul>

                      alt="customize motion animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Select any animation you want by double-clicking the presets. In this case, I selected a slight right preset, and you will notice that the start arrow and end arrow indicator are displayed.</p>
<p>In the Timeline panel, you have an option to customize the start and end of the Preset. Just drag the arrow keys on either side to reach the keyframe you wish to change. Just simple.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can also do it on the cloud image that we’ve added.</p>
<h2 id="Takeaway"><a href="#Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Takeaway"></a>Takeaway</h2><p>Keyframing can bring steady images to life by introducing animations. With the super-easy keyframing tool in Filmora, you can now make invigorating videos. From easy to complex key framing. The customization property lets you unbind your creativity and take your editing to a professional level. Make your logo pop by adding keyframe animations. Better yet, you can also animate text.</p>
<p>No matter what industry you’re in, Animation can be relevant. Small start-ups to giant corporations use animation videos, too. Animation videos help to explain tricky processes or concepts, sell a product, or even to gain recognition for a product. Everyone resonates with Animation in some way or another. Almost everyone has watched cartoons or animations in their life, so these tend to grab attention more effectively.</p>
<p>We all love animation. From the animated cartoons we watched as kids to the latest and hottest animated music video, there’s something about seeing visuals come alive that captivates and inspires us. But video animation isn’t just for children, and it isn’t just for the entertainment value only.</p>
