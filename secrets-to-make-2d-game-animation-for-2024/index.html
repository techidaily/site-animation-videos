<p>It will be beneficial while knowing <strong>how to make 2D animation for games</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements"><a href="#01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements" class="headerlink" title="01Focus on the story and start with simple movements"></a>01Focus on the story and start with simple movements</h3><p>You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don’t miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.</p>
<h3 id="02Use-keyframes-properly"><a href="#02Use-keyframes-properly" class="headerlink" title="02Use keyframes properly"></a>02Use keyframes properly</h3><p>You need to carefully use keyframes’ start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements.

<h3 id="03Enliven-your-characters"><a href="#03Enliven-your-characters" class="headerlink" title="03Enliven your characters"></a>03Enliven your characters</h3><p>You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.</p>
<p>Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical <strong>2D</strong> <strong>game animation</strong> strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>

This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>
<p>This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.</p>

<p>It will be beneficial while knowing <strong>how to make 2D animation for games</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements-1"><a href="#01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements-1" class="headerlink" title="01Focus on the story and start with simple movements"></a>01Focus on the story and start with simple movements</h3><p>You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don’t miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.</p>
<h3 id="02Use-keyframes-properly-1"><a href="#02Use-keyframes-properly-1" class="headerlink" title="02Use keyframes properly"></a>02Use keyframes properly</h3><p>You need to carefully use keyframes’ start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.</p>
<h3 id="03Enliven-your-characters-1"><a href="#03Enliven-your-characters-1" class="headerlink" title="03Enliven your characters"></a>03Enliven your characters</h3><p>You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.</p>
<p>Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical <strong>2D</strong> <strong>game animation</strong> strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-1"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-1"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-1" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>
<p>This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.</p>

<p>It will be beneficial while knowing <strong>how to make 2D animation for games</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements-2"><a href="#01Focus-on-the-story-and-start-with-simple-movements-2" class="headerlink" title="01Focus on the story and start with simple movements"></a>01Focus on the story and start with simple movements</h3><p>You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don’t miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.</p>
<h3 id="02Use-keyframes-properly-2"><a href="#02Use-keyframes-properly-2" class="headerlink" title="02Use keyframes properly"></a>02Use keyframes properly</h3><p>You need to carefully use keyframes’ start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements.

<p>Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical <strong>2D</strong> <strong>game animation</strong> strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-2"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg"
                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg"
                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg"
                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Go-back-to-animation-and-check-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5: Go back to animation and check"></a>05Step 5: Go back to animation and check</h3><p>Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg"
                      alt="check 2d game animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-2"><a href="#06Step-6-Create-a-contact-pose-2" class="headerlink" title="06Step 6: Create a contact pose"></a>06Step 6: Create a contact pose</h3><p>Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a “Contact Pose,” where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg"
                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Make-2D-Animation-for-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games"></a>Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games</h2><p>Making 2D game character animation isn’t a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.</p>
<p>Let’s use Unity as the <strong>best 2D animation software for</strong> <strong>games</strong> without further ado!</p>
<p>Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Start-the-Animation-tab-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1: Start the Animation tab"></a>01Step 1: Start the Animation tab</h3><p>Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg"
                      alt="select animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as “Animation.”</p>
<p>With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as “Idle” placed in our Animation folder.</p>
<p>It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg"
                      alt="idle animation tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s start animating this character!</p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Proceed-with-the-Idle-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation"></a>02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation</h3><p>IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg"
                      alt="a select idle animation"
                ></p>
<p>Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.</p>
<p>Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of “swinging” motion. Here is the pose that I chose:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg"
                      alt="2d game character pose"
                ></p>
<p>A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).</p>
<p>Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.</p>
<p>So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.</p>
<p>Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!</p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Start-walk-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3: Start walk animation"></a>03Step 3: Start walk animation</h3><p>Create a new animation clip called ‘Walk.”</p>
<p>This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation’s primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word “pose” intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg"
                      alt="Start walk animation"
                ></p>
<p>Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.</p>
<p>Then, about six frames ahead, we have a “passing pose.”</p>
<p>It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.</p>
<p>We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don’t move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.</p>
<p>Then, the “dynamic pose” with the left foot touching the ground this time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg"
                      alt="2d game dynamic pose"
                ></p>
<p>This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.</p>
<p>Now, we just require a final passing pose.</p>
<p>And then we recreate the same pose!</p>
<p>Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="copy first keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>We are done!</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Run-animation-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Run-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4: Run animation"></a>04Step 4: Run animation</h3><p>For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.</p>
<p>Create a new animation folder or clip called “Run.”</p>
<p>Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="start run animation"
                ></p>
<p>The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.</p>
<p>Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.</p>
<p>Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:</p>
<p>Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="2d game passing pose"
                ></p>
<p>And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.</p>

Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.</p>

This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.</p>

                      alt="2d game contact pose"
                ></p>
<p>We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we’re here, let’s add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.</p>
<p>So, this is the procedure to use the <strong>best 2D animation software for game</strong> <strong>development</strong> via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.</p>

<p>When we talk about motion, it makes us think about moves, but it refers to step motion when speaking about still-motion. So, in simple words, <strong>still motion animation</strong> refers to the animation that holds picture-to-picture motion animation.</p>
<p>This article covers all the relevant information related to <strong>still motion animation</strong>, paper motion animation, liquid motion animation. The name may vary, but such motions come under stop motion or <strong>still motion</strong> techniques to a great extent. That uses picture after picture or stopping camera process from reflecting animation to any inanimate objects or things. Under paper motion animation, images are adjusted in such a manner that results in continual animation reflection.</p>

<p><strong>Still motion animation</strong> is also known as <strong>walking motion animation and stalk motion animation</strong> used to boost a scene in animation. It comes in a frame-to-frame outlook. It can be a booster in horror movies, comedy, and thrillers. It used to express flashbacks, dreams, and summaries of a long scene. Sometimes it could be slower, faster, fade, blur or split frames to discover&#x2F;show unconscious scenes.</p>

<p>Adobe Animate is Adobe’s very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It’s also the one that we’d recommend if you’re looking into advanced <strong>adobe animate text animation</strong>!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-3-5-Creative-Ways-to-Animate-Text-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects"></a>Part 3 <strong>5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects</strong></h2><p>Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there’s <strong>adobe spark animate text</strong>, <strong>adobe premiere pro animate text</strong>, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.</p>
<p>We’ve listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be <strong>Adobe Animate text effects</strong> below to help you along:</p>
<h3 id="01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets"><a href="#01METHOD-1-After-Effects-Animation-Presets" class="headerlink" title="01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets"></a>01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets</h3><p>The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png"
                      alt="Text Effects &amp; Presets"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02METHOD-2-After-Effects-Text-Animators"><a href="#02METHOD-2-After-Effects-Text-Animators" class="headerlink" title="02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators"></a>02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators</h3><p>If the presets aren’t working out for you, you can also try out After Effect’s “animators” and “selectors”. To clarify, you add ‘animators’ to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a ‘selector’ in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png"
                      alt="After Effects: Animators"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03METHOD-3-Per-Character-3D-Text-Properties"><a href="#03METHOD-3-Per-Character-3D-Text-Properties" class="headerlink" title="03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties"></a>03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties</h3><p>If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a “Text” preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Per Character 3D Text Properties"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04METHOD-4-Path-Animation"><a href="#04METHOD-4-Path-Animation" class="headerlink" title="04METHOD 4: Path Animation"></a>04METHOD 4: Path Animation</h3><p>The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we’ve introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.</p>

                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h3 id="05METHOD-5-After-Effects-Selectors"><a href="#05METHOD-5-After-Effects-Selectors" class="headerlink" title="05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors"></a>05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors</h3><p>This next method is related to the ‘Animators’ methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4–which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>

And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation"><a href="#02Anticipation" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing"><a href="#04Timing" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h3 id="01It-is-fun"><a href="#01It-is-fun" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression"><a href="#02Lasting-impression" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget"><a href="#01Budget" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience"><a href="#03Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market"><a href="#04Market" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-1"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-1" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>

However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-1"><a href="#01Budget-1" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-1"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-1" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-1"><a href="#03Target-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-1"><a href="#04Market-1" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-1"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-1" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>

<p>Often called traditional animation, <strong>2D animation making</strong> mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.</p>

Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.</p>
<p>We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we’ve described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the <strong>2D animation making</strong> the easy way!</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: “What is 2D animation?”</p>
<p>You’re probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).</p>
<p>So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.</p>
<p>Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it’s not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, “is 2D animation dead?” but it’s still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.</p>
<p>The best way to learn <strong>2D animation making</strong> is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.</p>
<p>If you have already started learning but aren’t getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.</p>
<p>Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don’t have to think about everything.</p>
<p>If even they can’t do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Get feedback from mentors and other artists.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Increase the difficulty step by step.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-2-The-5-Principles-of-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation"></a>Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation</h2><p>Animators follow a list of strict principles to create the most inspiring projects. And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o<strong>f making 2D animation video</strong> memorable.</p>
<h3 id="01Squash-and-stretch-2"><a href="#01Squash-and-stretch-2" class="headerlink" title="01Squash and stretch"></a>01Squash and stretch</h3><p>Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                      alt="squash and stretch animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation-2"><a href="#02Anticipation-2" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

                      alt="anticipation animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out-2"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out-2" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="ease in animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing-2"><a href="#04Timing-2" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing-2"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing-2" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Anticipation-3"><a href="#02Anticipation-3" class="headerlink" title="02Anticipation"></a>02Anticipation</h3><p>Anticipation is one of the essential <strong>2D animation-making</strong> principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.</p>

                      alt="anticipation animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Ease-in-ease-out-3"><a href="#03Ease-in-ease-out-3" class="headerlink" title="03Ease in ease out"></a>03Ease in ease out</h3><p>Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.</p>

                      alt="ease in animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Timing-3"><a href="#04Timing-3" class="headerlink" title="04Timing"></a>04Timing</h3><p>The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters’ movements and objects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="timing animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Solid-Drawing-3"><a href="#05Solid-Drawing-3" class="headerlink" title="05Solid Drawing"></a>05Solid Drawing</h3><p>Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object’s dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-3-Reasons-to-Create-Animated-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-3-Reasons-to-Create-Animated-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 3 Reasons to Create Animated Videos"></a>Part 2 3 Reasons to Create Animated Videos</h2><p>We can describe a list of 5 reasons to use animation for business.</p>
<h3 id="01It-is-fun-3"><a href="#01It-is-fun-3" class="headerlink" title="01It is fun"></a>01It is fun</h3><p>Your animation doesn’t need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It’s an ideal way to catch customers’ attention instead of strictly for marketing.</p>
<h3 id="02Lasting-impression-3"><a href="#02Lasting-impression-3" class="headerlink" title="02Lasting impression"></a>02Lasting impression</h3><p>The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.</p>
<p>So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.</p>
<h3 id="03Boosts-conversion-rate-3"><a href="#03Boosts-conversion-rate-3" class="headerlink" title="03Boosts conversion rate"></a>03Boosts conversion rate</h3><p>Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.</p>
<p>So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business’s animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-3"><a href="#Part-4-5-Essential-Tips-for-Your-2D-Animation-Making-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making"></a>Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making</h2><p>The decision to excel in <strong>2D animation making</strong> could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won’t get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.</p>
<p>You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let’s discuss those points!</p>
<h3 id="01Budget-3"><a href="#01Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="01Budget"></a>01Budget</h3><p>The budget is the best factor because you can’t do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation software for beginners</strong>. Yet, animation for business doesn’t demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!</p>
<h3 id="02Brand-Positioning-3"><a href="#02Brand-Positioning-3" class="headerlink" title="02Brand Positioning"></a>02Brand Positioning</h3><p>Consider your brand positioning! While <strong>2D animation making</strong>, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.</p>
<p>It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand’s overview from the customer’s point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.</p>
<h3 id="03Target-Audience-3"><a href="#03Target-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="03Target Audience"></a>03Target Audience</h3><p>The <strong>2D animation making</strong> also holds about the target audience, but it doesn’t mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.</p>
<h3 id="04Market-3"><a href="#04Market-3" class="headerlink" title="04Market"></a>04Market</h3><p>You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the <strong>2D</strong> <strong>animation making</strong>. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3"><a href="#05Do-Your-Research-in-Advance-3" class="headerlink" title="05Do Your Research in Advance"></a>05Do Your Research in Advance</h3><p>Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video’s production from beginning to end.</p>
<p>You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you’re promoting since a live-action video.</p>
