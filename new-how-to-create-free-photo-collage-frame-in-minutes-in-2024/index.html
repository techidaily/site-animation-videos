<p>When you are working on photoshop to make a collage, the images will need a collage background because it is on this background that the photos will assemble. If you have made a collage before on photoshop, you can use the old <strong>collage photoshop template</strong>. Otherwise, you need to create a new document for the collage.</p>

                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-8.jpg"
                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>

<p>When we talk about motion, it makes us think about moves, but it refers to step motion when speaking about still-motion. So, in simple words, <strong>still motion animation</strong> refers to the animation that holds picture-to-picture motion animation.</p>
<p>This article covers all the relevant information related to <strong>still motion animation</strong>, paper motion animation, liquid motion animation. The name may vary, but such motions come under stop motion or <strong>still motion</strong> techniques to a great extent. That uses picture after picture or stopping camera process from reflecting animation to any inanimate objects or things. Under paper motion animation, images are adjusted in such a manner that results in continual animation reflection.</p>

<p>Marketers and content creators can take full advantage of online apps to develop amazing animated videos that would instantly grasp the viewer’s attention. Here are three secrets you should know about creating an amazing animated video:</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>

<p>Marketers and content creators can take full advantage of online apps to develop amazing animated videos that would instantly grasp the viewer’s attention. Here are three secrets you should know about creating an amazing animated video:</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Animating images can be a fun and engaging process. It only involves understanding the mindset of your target audience. This process need not be complicated. You can start out by converting your photos into 3D animations using a <strong>3D animated photo maker.</strong></p>

<p>Marketers and content creators can take full advantage of online apps to develop amazing animated videos that would instantly grasp the viewer’s attention. Here are three secrets you should know about creating an amazing animated video:</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to tell a story with moving pictures.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They add a different level of visual charisma to the storytelling process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> With the help of a few interesting and easy-to-use apps, you can create stunning cinematic images and establish your own unique style of storytelling.</p>

                      alt="Storytelling"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Persuasive Call to Action:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A call-to-action is a standard way of telling people what you want them to do such as making a purchase, downloading an e-book or registering for a subscription.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps your audience if you guide them step-by-step with the help of images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Try out a combination of both written and animated graphics to boost your content’s persuasion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to convince people when they have the information laid out in front of their eyes.</p>

                      alt="Persuasive Call to Action"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplify the Complex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It helps if you imagine your audience like children who need a picture book to learn their lessons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It is easier to retain information when they are visually stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Designing animated graphics is pretty easy when you understand the purpose behind it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Scrutinize your work to check if it is causing any hindrance in keeping up with the information.</p>
