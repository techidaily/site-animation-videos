<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>
<p>The value you insert into the <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> box is based upon the number of frames your video contains.

<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>

Here, your stop motion animation will get its final posture. You need to place all the images you wish to include in the video’s final cut into a folder and arrange them the same way as they should appear in the video. Even though <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> provides powerful video editing tools that enable you to improve the colors in the footage you are syncing with, it is best to edit your photos via dedicated photo editing software.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora’s Media tab. Moreover, you should also import all audio files you would like to use in your project before doing any actual editing. When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.</p>
<p>Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you’re making.</p>
<p>The value you insert into the <strong>Photo</strong> <strong>Duration</strong> box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn’t let you minimize a project’s frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04.</p>
<p>You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the <strong>Play</strong> button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.</p>

<p>GIF, which stands for Graphics Interchange Format, has now become extremely popular among social media. From sending our reactions to something to wishing others on special occasions, GIFs can be used in so many ways. Though, there are times when we would like to use animated GIF icons in your designs to make them more appealing. Therefore, in this post, I will let you know how to create some funny GIF icons and would also share a few resources to find readily available GIF icons.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop video repeat"
                ></p>

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-1"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-1"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-1"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-2"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-2"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-2"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop video repeat"

<h3 id="Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-3"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Adobe-Photoshop-to-Create-GIF-Icons-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons"></a>Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons</h3><p>If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Step-1-Load-Assets-on-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop"></a>Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop</h5><p>At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File &gt; Scripts to load media assets into your stack.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop load script"
                ></p>
<p>This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File &gt; Layer and create a new layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop add layers"
                ></p>
<p>You can now rename your layers and can go to its File &gt; Window &gt; Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop view timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-3"><a href="#Step-2-Work-on-the-Video-Timeline-to-Create-a-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF"></a>Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF</h5><p>Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop create frame animation"
                ></p>
<p>Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop make frames"
                ></p>
<p>This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop adjust duration"
                ></p>
<p>You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop video repeat"
