<h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Specs-Dimensions-of-LinkedIn-Slideshow"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Specs-Dimensions-of-LinkedIn-Slideshow" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Are the Specs &amp; Dimensions of LinkedIn Slideshow?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Are the Specs &amp; Dimensions of LinkedIn Slideshow?</strong></h2><p>Now that you are familiar with the credibility of a LinkedIn carousel post in the professional world, let us get into some more details of the utility with proceeding towards a discussion of the different specifications and dimensions of a <strong>LinkedIn slideshow</strong> and the professional aspects of the same in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Take Care of the File Size</p>
<p>The credibility of LinkedIn carousel posts lies in the engaging presentation of your static and monotonous text to make them stand out of the crowded newsfeed. True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a Commendable File Format</p>
<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make a Careful Upload</p>
<p>When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Bonus Tip</p>
<p>To include the latest and up-to-date information within your presentation, consider visiting the LinkedIn official webpage directly from your platform account.</p>

Opening his work profile, you would firstly get to see an infographic PDF export, which are later uploaded as document files on a LinkedIn post that speaks in favor of the statistics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Share Action Oriented Business Modules</strong></p>

Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict Your Slide Count</p>
<p>When creating a <strong>slideshow LinkedIn</strong> presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background.

As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use a Commendable File Format</p>
<p>You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.</p>

<p>When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1</strong>: creating the story and conceptualizing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2</strong>: making the 3D models</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3</strong>: rigging, texturing, and animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong>: setting up the cameras and lightning</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5</strong>: rendering</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6</strong>: applying special effects and compositing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7</strong>: editing, music, and Foley</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8</strong>: the final output</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with <strong>3D animation courses online for free</strong> to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.</p>
<p>As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>
<p>You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Modeling:</strong> The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animation and layout:</strong> At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Rendering</strong>: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer</p>
<p>For <strong>learning 3D animation</strong>, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to <strong>learn 3D animation and graphic design courses</strong>.</p>

<p>3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment.

<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.</p>

Animation video is a craft in which images go through the process of conspiring, layout addition, and photographic chronology to create an illusion of action. In this article, let’s learn the importance of video animations and when and why to use this technique.</p>

In this article, you can read more about why media marketing is getting more essential in comparison to text marketing. Therefore, an explainer video with Animation is an amazing way to show your target audience who you are, where you stand for, what you do and how you can solve the customer’s problem.</p>
<p>Video animation is an engaging technique that can help you comprehensively tell your story. Animated meaning can be better comprehended as a simulation of motion created by showing a series of pictures. Animated videos for a business catch the viewers and make for an enjoyable story-telling experience.</p>
<p>Often, animation videos are used to explain a concept or process. It’s straightforward to make these videos appealing and likable as you can primarily create them however you want. It can take longer to get the point across when people explain how to do something. Animations not only trigger emotions but spark conversations as well.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-most-common-types-of-Animation"><a href="#What-are-most-common-types-of-Animation" class="headerlink" title="What are most common types of Animation?"></a>What are most common types of Animation?</h2><p>The purpose of this article is to take you through the complexity of the different types of animation styles and methods. It also covers the track you should take (and what that path entails) to become an animator for each of the five types.</p>
<p>This guide is not about learning how to animate. But instead, it breaks down the five types of Animation available to you and what you’ll need to start animating: best software, schools, and courses.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Graphics (Key framing)</strong>: Motion graphics focus on making dynamic and exciting presentations of moving text logos and fundamental illustrations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion graphics can be 2D and 3D, and you’ll find them everywhere in news, sporting videos, the news, and other TV productions.</li>
<li>Correct character animation is generally outside the scope of motion graphics, but many core animation principles also apply to motion graphics.</li>
<li>Creating Motion Graphics depends on the plan used since video editing software often have different user interface or settings, but the idea is the same. Motion Graphics usually involves animating texts, pictures, or video clips using keyframing that is tweened to make a smooth motion between frames.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="key frame animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Traditional Animation</strong>: This is the classic type of Animation you’re probably most well known with. In the past, animators drew characters frame by frame, and then those pictures were moved onto transparent sheets for painting. That’s where the term animation comes from.</p>
<p>They started scanning drawings into the computer for digital coloring. The important thing is that hand-drawn animators still create their animation frame by frame using the same method and concept as in those old days of paper and cels.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-Motion-Graphics-Animation-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora"></a>How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora</h2><p>Keyframes specify the start or end of a transition in a shot. A series of keyframes can give the semblance of the movement of an object. Keyframes include parameters such as Position, Scale, Opacity, and Rotation. These values can be changed and customized to make animations using keyframing.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> makes it really easy to use. Even learners or novices can use keyframe animation to create extraordinary videos. Plus, the keyframe templates are an added satisfaction. If you have limited time and need a quick fix, using Presets in the Animation tab is your best bet.</p>
<p>For this example, we’ll walk you through using Keyframes on the short video clip to make your Animation using Wondershare Filmora.</p>

<p>Step1 Launch Wondershare Filmora from your system and select New Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-01.png"
                      alt="launch wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Import your selected images. In this case I imported no background images to have a clear view on how key framing works.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-animation-file-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="import animation file filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag or add the image on the Timeline Panel.</p>
<p>In this case I use a dove and a cloud to demo the Motion graphics animation</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/motion-graphics-animation-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="motion graphics animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double click the image then the Animation tab will display. Here, there are available presets, either the latest or the Legacy Animation, as indicated on the display that you can use.</p>
<p>There is also a tab if you want to customize your animations which requires premium account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fade In</li>
<li>Fade Out</li>
<li>Pause</li>
<li>Slide right</li>
<li>Slide up</li>
<li>Vortex In</li>
<li>Vortex Out</li>
<li>Zoom In</li>
<li>Zoom Out</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-motion-animation-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="customize motion animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Select any animation you want by double-clicking the presets. In this case, I selected a slight right preset, and you will notice that the start arrow and end arrow indicator are displayed.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-8"><a href="#In-this-article-8" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>
<p>| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| ——————- | ————————————————————————————————————————- | ————————————————————————————————————————————— |<br>| <strong>About</strong>           | It is a game engine that enables you in creating human-machine interfaces, AR simulations, customize splash screens, etc. | It is a computer graphics software that is open source and is mainly used for creating 3D models.                                       |<br>| <strong>Types Supported</strong> | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| <strong>Best Purpose</strong>    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |</p>
<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation"><a href="#Step-1Installation" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Adding-Rig-Effectors"><a href="#Step-4Adding-Rig-Effectors" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Adding Rig Effectors"></a>Step 4Adding Rig Effectors</h5><p>This step enables one to add Gizmos to Transforms, facilitating selection and visualisation. The “Effector” are invisible during “Game View”, and this step enhances the quality of the character animation.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

You will find the “Bind Pose” option there, and you will have to click on it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="bind pose unity"
                ></p>
<p>Then add a child GameObject below “Character Rig”. Then add a new child GameObject below “Right Arm IK”. Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the “Right Arm Ik” by naming the first and the second one “RH IK Target” and “RH IK Hint”, respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="rh ik hint unity"
                ></p>
<p>Integrate the “Rig Builder Component” with the “Animator root GameObject”. Then proceed with selecting the “CharecterRig GameObject” and integrating a “Rig Component”. Select “Two Bone IK Contrainst” to the “Right Arm IK.”</p>
<p><img

In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-1"><a href="#Step-1Installation-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-1"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-1"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-2"><a href="#Step-1Installation-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups.

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-2"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-11"><a href="#In-this-article-11" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-3"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>
