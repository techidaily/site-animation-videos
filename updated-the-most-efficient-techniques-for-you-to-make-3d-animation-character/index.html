Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg"
                      alt="import object unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animations in unity 2d"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.</p>

Why? Because Unity is more suitable for animating objects for games. Not to mention, Unity has a steep learning curve and if you are not an experienced Unity developer, you may fail to create a 2D animation properly.</p>
<p>So, if you only need a 2D animation for videos, we have a better alternative for the job.

<p>While <strong>importing 2D animations into Unity</strong>, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.</p>
<p>Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the “Stripe Editor” window. With the “Stripe Editor”, you’ll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.</p>
<p>At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you’ll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the “Windows” option on your screen.</p>

<p>Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn’t mean that you cannot design <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong>.</p>
<p>In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-2"><a href="#Part-1-Can-Unity-Be-Used-for-2D-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?"></a>Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?</h2><p>First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers&#x2F;designers can use Unity to create stunning <strong>Unity 2D animations</strong> for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you’ll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that for each object, you’ll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.</p>
<p>With the Sprite library, <strong>2D animations with Unity</strong> becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Make-a-2D-Animation-in-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?</h2><p>To create a <strong>2D animation with Unity,</strong> the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it’ll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.</p>
<p>After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>

<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>

                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save image photoshop"

<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Another way to open the pages you have selected for your collage is through the “Drag and Drop” function. It is more effortless to choose the images and open them in Photoshop. After you have opened the photos in Photoshop, it will open in a different tab and look like in the following picture.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-3.jpg"
                      alt="open photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Make a new file for your collage on photoshop</strong></p>
<p>The third step requires you to make a new file for your <strong>photo collage in photoshop</strong>. For this, you need to select or click on the “File” option on Photoshop. Then, click on the “New” option. It will help you make a new file for your collage. You can also select the “ctrl” and “N” together.</p>
<p>As you click on the “New” option, you will be given options to choose from. Choose the one that matches your preference.</p>
<p>When you are working on photoshop to make a collage, the images will need a collage background because it is on this background that the photos will assemble. If you have made a collage before on photoshop, you can use the old <strong>collage photoshop template</strong>. Otherwise, you need to create a new document for the collage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-4.jpg"
                      alt="new option photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one</strong></p>
<p>Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the “Marquee Tool” of Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg"
                      alt="marquee tool photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Another way of doing so is by pressing the “ctrl” and “A” keys on your keyboard together. You will find the matching ants border around the image when you do this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-6.jpg"
                      alt="add image"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to the “Edit” option and choose “Copy” there. Or, you can also select the “ctrl” and “C” keys on your keywords together. Then go to your new document and select the option of “Paste” from the “Edit” option, or you can also press the “ctrl” and “V” keys together to do so.</p>
<p>The photo will be added in its own layer on the new document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5: Arrange the images</strong></p>
<p>Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your <strong>collage creator in photoshop</strong>, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the “Move” tool or simply tap V. You can also use the “Free Transform” tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the “Free Transform” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Integrate image space</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create a collage in photoshop</strong> in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.</p>
<p>And the second method is by accessing and using the “Layers” feature in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-8.jpg"
                      alt="add layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7: Merge all the Layers</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary when you have used the “Layer” feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the “Layer” option. So, go to the “Layer” option and select the “Merge Invisible” option present there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-9.jpg"
                      alt="merge layer photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 8: cropping the final picture</strong></p>
<p>Before the final step, it is important that you crop the final picture. And to do so, you can opt for the “Crop tool”. You will be able to access it easily, or you can also simply tap C to use the “Crop tool.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-10.jpg"
                      alt="crop photo photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 9: Save the final collage and export</strong></p>
<p>After you have done all the necessary changes and are satisfied with the final collage, then, save the file. To do so, go to the “File” option and select the “Save as” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-11.jpg"
                      alt="save image photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Then choose the file type to be “JPEG”. Type the name you would want the collage to be saved as. This completes the process of saving the file. Then choose the image quality you would want the collage to be exported in.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-12.jpg"
                      alt="save a jpeg photoshop"
                ></p>
