## Why use animation for business?

As we have earlier mentioned, animation is the key to attractive branding. According to Smart Insights' recent article on Video Marketing in 2020, around 92% of marketers feel this an essential part of business strategy. In contrast, 88% of marketers think that video marketing in animation offers them positive ROI.

We can describe to you a list of 5 reasons to use animation for business as follows.

#### It is fun and entertaining

Your animation doesn't need to be realistic or accurate. The purpose of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill fun and entertainment. The animation is a way to grab customers' attention rather than being used as a strict marketing tool. Customers will look over to the story more interesting than the traditional ad system.

#### Lasting impression

The animated videos for business leave a memorable impression on the current as well as new customers. However, you must be clear about using animation in a way that creatively tells about your business. A story that is too different from the business purpose may not be a good idea to create a lasting impression.

So, you must tell about the values you inject in a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the visuals and the information they get from it.

#### Boosts conversion rate

Due to the highly attractive nature of business animation videos, the customer is likely to complete the action as expected by the brand. More than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content rather than getting you the high bounce off rates. So, you should beautifully explain the merits of your service or product to the user in animated videos for business. It's great if you add CTA at the end of the video.

#### Easy updates

Being a potent marketing tool animation for business is a new and updated aspect. It is one of the advanced digital technologies to update messaging and marketing collateral and reflect your business values. The presentation of content with animation appeals to different and new potential audiences cost-effectively and efficiently.

#### Turns complex ideas into easy ones

Dealing with complex ideas or products in the text form can be pretty hard to convey effectively unless you insert animation in the text and make it attractive. After all, complex ideas can't quickly turn into easy ones.

## How to choose animation styles for your business?

After knowing the apparent benefits of animation, we will discuss how you can choose different animation styles for your business. There could be lots of types, among which we are just going to mention four basic animation styles for business.

#### Kinetic Typography

![kinetic typography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinetic-typography.jpg)

Kinetic typography means 'moving text.' You can see this kind of animation everywhere, from website landing pages to TV commercials. The tool can be useful to shrink, expand, fly, grow, move in slow motion, or change the letter in numerous ways to grab readers' attention.

#### Character animation

![character animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/character-animation.jpg)

Character animation refers to making animated animals or persons. It depends solely on the animator's animator or demand to create a character and decide how it will move, look, or interact with the external environment.

#### Whiteboard animation

The whiteboard animation is another famous kind of animation for business where a storyboard is the basics. The process tells you a story mostly by the presentation of someone's hands. Notably, the whiteboard is to represent the time-lapse or stop motion effect.

#### Infographics

![infographic for business](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/infographic-for-business.jpg)

## What to Consider before Making Animated Business Videos?

The decision to make animated videos for business could be a tricky task even if you are aware of the importance, as mentioned above, of animation. Merely knowing the importance won't get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.

You need to implement the right strategies and know what factors are essential to look for before making animated videos for business. So, let's discuss those critical points!

#### Budget

The budget comes as the top-most factor because you can't do anything without enough money. So, be ready to invest a fair amount or at least invest in reliable video editing software. However, animation for business doesn't demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, using Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $49.99 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. However, it also depends upon the kind of job and style of business values you want to present in the animation. You have to outsource if it's expert-level work!

#### Brand Positioning

Consider your brand positioning! While using the animation for business, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values than mere visuals. They want to know your identity as a brand and your industry. It will help if you incorporate some brand positioning first before deciding to make animation videos for business. What you can do is check the overview of the brand from the customer's point of view. After that, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C.

#### Target Audience

Making animation videos about the target audience is essential, but it doesn't necessarily mean making videos only for them. The very first question is to ask why you are making such a video. There could be many reasons behind the same, such as gaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a new product or brand.

#### Market

Video promotion is the last but not least, step! You must know the ideas to market your videos before even starting the creation. The market can be Instagram or any other social media platform where you get a high presence of potential customers. Furthermore, the video should not be too pushy.

**Claymation** sculptures originate from blobs of clay. Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. **Clay animation** not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.

**●** **Shaun the Sheep:** Shaun is a sheep (obviously) who goes on world adventures. The movies was featured as the TV spin off. The character was meant to appeal to both children and family. The entire movie was dependant on movement and expressions rather than dialogue making Claymation the perfect medium to bring out the character.

**●** **Shaun the Sheep:** Shaun is a sheep (obviously) who goes on world adventures. The movies was featured as the TV spin off. The character was meant to appeal to both children and family.

This movie has a classic appeal amongst children an adults alike.

### 02The Nighmare before Christmas (1993)

![nightmare before christmas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-2.jpg)

Directed by Time Burton, this film is one that impresses us all every time. The success of this Claymation is embedded in the fact that it made creepy gothic characters look appealing. It has a mixture of both the Halloween and Christmas theme. The character Jack Skellington goes through a magic door to arrive at ‘Christmas Town’. Using Claymation was an excellent choice for the script as it enabled the animators to bring about that distorted movements that evolved into a gorgeous visual storytelling.

### 03Chicken Run (1994)

![chicken run](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-3.jpg)

Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.

### 04The Corpse Bride (2005)

![corpse bride](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-4.jpg)

The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.

### 05Coraline (2009)

![coraline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-5.jpg)

Here’s where Tim Burton establishes his cult following. The film Caroline was based the novel by Neil Gaiman. The story is about the weird adventures of a girl named ‘Caroline’ and a button eyed rag doll who she meets after travelling through a portal. Laika Studios made the appeal of the film as beautiful yet unsettling. It harbors plenty of dark and creepy aspects like by many followers of this type of fiction.

### 06Frankenweenie (1984)

![frankenweenie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-6.jpg)

There are dozen animated films that were way ahead of their time and were discontinued as the medium was seen more to be specifically directed for children only. Tim Burton’s creation ‘Frankenweenie’ was considered a ‘love letter’ to the Golden Age of Horror films. It was considered too dark for the average viewer so the director was later let go by Disney.

### 07Paranorman (2012)

![paranorman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-7.jpg)

A more somber attempt at stop motion films was Paranorman. It featured printed faces in the characters which needed a new and innovative creative approach. People experienced ground breaking characterization of an openly gay character in the film which was a milestone in terms of mainstream animated films. Films like ‘Paranorman’ perfectly depicts the entry of modern film making software like ****[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** and Maya in stop motion animations.

### 08The Boxtrolls (2014)

![boxtrolls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-8.jpg)

From the makers of Paranorman, Boxtrolls all introduces an innovative approach to using clay models in films. Featuring Ben Kingsley, Simon Peggs and Richard Ayoade, Boxtrolls is probably the very few box office hits on this list. The film first premiered at the Venice Film Festival the same year of its release.

## Part 1 What's Text Animation?

![Text Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know1.png)

"**Text Animation**" refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!

## Part 2 **What Adobe Program is Best for Text Animation?**

![Adobe Animation Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know2.png)

Adobe Animate is Adobe's very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

![After Effects: Animators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png)

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

![Per Character 3D Text Properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know5.png)

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

![Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know6.png)

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.
