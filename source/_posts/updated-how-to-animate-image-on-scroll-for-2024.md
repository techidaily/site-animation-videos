### 02Use ScrollSequence

Now, if you are not a professional editor or don't want to overcomplicate things, you can use ScrollSequence to add image-on-scroll animation to your website. For readers who don't know, ScrollSequence is a built-in WordPress plugin that you can directly install in your WordPress manager. The tool offers hundreds of ready-to-use animation templates that you can integrate and customize without any hassle.

All the templates offer complete customization, which means you can adjust the animation playback, import your own media files, and even customize the text. It's worth understanding that this method will only work if you are using WordPress as the CMS platform for your website. ScrollSequence is only available as a WordPress plugin and you won't be able to use it with any other website builder

### 03Write Your Own JavaScript Code

Finally, you can also write your own JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll. However, this method will be a bit complicated as you would require technical expertise to write dedicated JavaScript scripts to animate image-on-scroll. If you choose this solution, you'll have to start with writing HTML and CSS codes. This will help you style your web page in the beginning. And, once the web design is up and ready, you can move towards writing the JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll in your web page.

## Part 2 How to Create a Scrolling Text Animation (Infinite Loop)

Like image-on-scroll, text-on-scroll is another popular way to add visually appealing animations to your web designs. Text-on-scroll animations work the same way as image-on-scroll animations - the only difference is that these types of animations focus on the text playback instead of images. Again, you can use different methods to **animate text on scroll** and make your website's content run in an infinite loop.

Some of these methods include:

### 01Use Filmora

Thanks to Filmora's advanced editing panel, you can also use it to animate text within the videos. This will be an ideal solution for users who want to add videos with dedicated text banners and titles on their websites. With Filmora, you'll be able to animate the text and make custom transitions in a hassle-free manner. Let's walk you through the detailed procedure of using Wondershare Filmora to add text animation to your videos.

**Step 1 -** Open Filmora on your system and load the video into its timeline.

**Step 2 -** Double-tap the video file, and switch to the "Titles" tab. You'll see a list of different title templates on your screen. Browse through these results and drag the desired template to the timelines. Make sure to adjust the title layer right above the video layer.

![choose title template filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-04.JPG)

**Step 3 -** Again, double-click the title layer and you'll see a dedicated text editor on your screen. Here enter the text that you want to display within the video. You can also select text size, orientation, and font to personalize its appearance.

**Step 4 -** Finally, switch to the "Animation" tab at the left sidebar. Choose any of these animation templates and the text within the video will be animated automatically.

![animate title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-05.JPG)

So, that's how you can use Filmora to animate text-on-scroll to improve the overall visual appearance of your website videos.

### 02Scroll-Text-Animations for Single Words

Another way to implement scroll-text animations is to modify the HTML & CSS code of your website. Again, this method will only be feasible if you have prior coding experience and know how to write well-optimized code.

![one line animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-06.JPG)

The easiest way to animate text scrolls is through single-line animations. In this situation, only one line gets displayed at any particular time, which automatically gets switched to the next one as soon as you scroll down the cursor. If you are planning to create simple text-based animations, this method will help you get the job done easily.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** You can animate image-on-scroll and text-on-scroll to enhance the overall visual appearance of your websites and make them more engaging for the end-users.

**●** If you are planning to upload dedicated videos on your website, you can use Wondershare Filmora, a fully-functional video editing tool, to animate both images and text through an easy-to-navigate editing panel.

**●** You should only opt for the coding method if you are an experienced coder and have worked on HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects in the past.

The tool offers hundreds of ready-to-use animation templates that you can integrate and customize without any hassle.

All the templates offer complete customization, which means you can adjust the animation playback, import your own media files, and even customize the text. It's worth understanding that this method will only work if you are using WordPress as the CMS platform for your website. ScrollSequence is only available as a WordPress plugin and you won't be able to use it with any other website builder

### 03Write Your Own JavaScript Code

Finally, you can also write your own JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll. However, this method will be a bit complicated as you would require technical expertise to write dedicated JavaScript scripts to animate image-on-scroll. If you choose this solution, you'll have to start with writing HTML and CSS codes. This will help you style your web page in the beginning. And, once the web design is up and ready, you can move towards writing the JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll in your web page.

## Part 2 How to Create a Scrolling Text Animation (Infinite Loop)

Like image-on-scroll, text-on-scroll is another popular way to add visually appealing animations to your web designs. Text-on-scroll animations work the same way as image-on-scroll animations - the only difference is that these types of animations focus on the text playback instead of images. Again, you can use different methods to **animate text on scroll** and make your website's content run in an infinite loop.

Some of these methods include:

### 01Use Filmora

Thanks to Filmora's advanced editing panel, you can also use it to animate text within the videos. This will be an ideal solution for users who want to add videos with dedicated text banners and titles on their websites. With Filmora, you'll be able to animate the text and make custom transitions in a hassle-free manner. Let's walk you through the detailed procedure of using Wondershare Filmora to add text animation to your videos.

**Step 1 -** Open Filmora on your system and load the video into its timeline.

**Step 2 -** Double-tap the video file, and switch to the "Titles" tab. You'll see a list of different title templates on your screen. Browse through these results and drag the desired template to the timelines. Make sure to adjust the title layer right above the video layer.

![choose title template filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-04.JPG)

**Step 3 -** Again, double-click the title layer and you'll see a dedicated text editor on your screen. Here enter the text that you want to display within the video. You can also select text size, orientation, and font to personalize its appearance.

**Step 4 -** Finally, switch to the "Animation" tab at the left sidebar. Choose any of these animation templates and the text within the video will be animated automatically.

![animate title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-05.JPG)

So, that's how you can use Filmora to animate text-on-scroll to improve the overall visual appearance of your website videos.

### 02Scroll-Text-Animations for Single Words

Another way to implement scroll-text animations is to modify the HTML & CSS code of your website. Again, this method will only be feasible if you have prior coding experience and know how to write well-optimized code.

![one line animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-06.JPG)

The easiest way to animate text scrolls is through single-line animations. In this situation, only one line gets displayed at any particular time, which automatically gets switched to the next one as soon as you scroll down the cursor. If you are planning to create simple text-based animations, this method will help you get the job done easily.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** You can animate image-on-scroll and text-on-scroll to enhance the overall visual appearance of your websites and make them more engaging for the end-users.

**●** If you are planning to upload dedicated videos on your website, you can use Wondershare Filmora, a fully-functional video editing tool, to animate both images and text through an easy-to-navigate editing panel.

**●** You should only opt for the coding method if you are an experienced coder and have worked on HTML/CSS/JavaScript projects in the past.

How do animes usually set up for particular genres? Study the storylines, the hooks, the emotion required for different kinds of scenes. You need to actually know your stuff before you can even start thinking about dubbing any anime. Don't ever decide to become an anime voice actor if you don't like animes. Most of the scenes may appear silly to you not to talk of the vocabulary which may just sound weird and annoying to one who is not a fan.

### 2\. Train Your Voice Regularly

Of course, that won't come cheap. You should be able to learn and master how to use your voice on demand. Train your voice to sound the way you want, consistently. This is very important because, during dubbing, you're going to get lines that require you to speak for two or more minutes.

### 3\. Practice Anime Voice Acting Daily (Set Up A Home Studio)

This is almost the same as training your voice. Practicing to be a voice actor comes with a lot of demands, you may need to set up a home studio. Scratch that! You actually need to set up a home studio, this will help you successfully practice your voicing on various animes. You can easily pick any of your favorite anime and start dubbing it, to see how your voice would sound and if you'd be able to match a level of consistency.

### 5\. Audition, Audition, Audition

There is no way you will become a voice actor if you don't audition, is there? When you're fully sure you can face the crowd with your voice then it's time to go for auditions. Don't get me wrong, you don't actually have to be perfect before you go for auditions but make sure you know a thing or two about what you're doing. Make sure you understand what needs to be done, make sure you have a good grasp of what you need to do. Apply for auditions at different places and confidently give them your best. You're bound to get a gig.

### 6\. Be Consistent And Never Give Up

If peradventure you don't get selected for any of your auditions, it's important you don't give up. Stay active, remain consistent with your activeness, don't allow any emotion to weigh you down. Just be sure that you know what you're doing and keep at it, continue applying for auditions while mastering your voice. You're bound to strike a great gig one day.

**Cartoon character drawing** is usually a vital aspect of any child's life who loves to watch cartoon series and can sometimes be someone's favorite thing in the world.

![how to draw cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-1.jpg)

A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child's life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.

However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing **cool cartoon drawings** that will match different audiences, both older and younger.

## Part 1 **How to Draw Cartoon Characters Step by Step**

Note that in the world we live in, Professionals were once students, and experts were once beginners. This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: "learning." Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician's assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.

![how to draw cartoons characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

Step 1:

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**Step 7:** Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

![how to draw with colour 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-6.jpg)

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

In the recent few years, videos have become the primary tool for marketers to attract their target customers. Unlike banners and pamphlets, videos are relatively more engaging and make it easier for marketers to establish a connection with the viewers. Now, each brand has different preferences when it comes to choosing the right video marketing strategy.

While some brands opt for conventional video advertisements, others get a bit creative and introduce **graphics animation** to their videos to make them more captivating. Of course, if you want to maximize the user's attention and retain more customers, you would prefer the latter. Animated videos are more engaging and also sets the brand apart from the rest of the crowd.

02 [What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?](#Part 2)

03 [5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics](#Part 3)

04 [How to Create Animated Graphics That Stand Out](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Why Study Graphic Design and Animation?

So, why should you care about graphic design and animation? The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.

However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why **graphics and animations** should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.

Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.

## Part 2 What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?

Now, whenever we talk about **graphic animation videos**, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.

### 01Motion Graphics

![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

![graphic design template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-2.jpg)

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

In the recent few years, videos have become the primary tool for marketers to attract their target customers. Unlike banners and pamphlets, videos are relatively more engaging and make it easier for marketers to establish a connection with the viewers. Now, each brand has different preferences when it comes to choosing the right video marketing strategy.

While some brands opt for conventional video advertisements, others get a bit creative and introduce **graphics animation** to their videos to make them more captivating. Of course, if you want to maximize the user's attention and retain more customers, you would prefer the latter. Animated videos are more engaging and also sets the brand apart from the rest of the crowd.

03 [5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Why Study Graphic Design and Animation?

So, why should you care about graphic design and animation? The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.

However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why **graphics and animations** should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.

Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.

## Part 2 What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?

Now, whenever we talk about **graphic animation videos**, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.

### 01Motion Graphics

![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

![graphic design template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-2.jpg)

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.
