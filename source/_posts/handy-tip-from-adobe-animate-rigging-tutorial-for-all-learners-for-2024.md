01 [Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?](#Part 2)

03 [Where to Rig and Animate More Characters?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?

The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.

![Rig Mapping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-01.jpg)

For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.

The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.

## Part 2 How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?

## Part 1 What's Music Video GIF?

GIFs are essentially animated image files that already form an effective and interesting means of communication and media sharing. Your messages get additional spunk and appeal when you add relatable audios to your GIFs. A **music video GIF** is one that you create by adding sound to the originally mute GIF files. Additionally, creating music enabled GIFs is a fun activity on its own.

Whether create them casually or use them as a marketing tool, sound effects tend to considerably upgrade the utility of an animated or unmoving snap.

## Part 2 How to Easily Add Music to Your GIF?

Musical GIF videos are quite interesting, no doubt on that, but what is noticeable here is that GIFs do not have inbuilt audio features. You need to add sound additionally to these files to create musical GIF videos. When trying to make your own **music GIF video**, you can take help of the following tools:

### 01Kapwing Editor

This one is a free online tool that helps you add audio to your GIFs. This application is free from issues of spam and watermark requirements. It assures you of a quality editing experience without supporting unnecessary and annoying advertisements.

Using this tool, you can create musical GIF videos in two different ways. Take the following steps to create musical GIF videos with this application:

**●** **Using The Kapwing Studio:**

Open the Studio and select the GIF and music files you want to merge. Upload the selected files in the tool.

Customize your audio in the Studio timeline to trim the sound file to the specific segment you wish to add to your GIF. You can also introduce volume adjustments and waveform effects to enhance your **music video for GIF** for an extra catch.

You can further add text and make size adjustments to your GIF using the sidebar controls.

Once you have finalized everything, click ‘Export' to download the GIF music video in MP4 format. Note that if you download the GIF format, your video will lose the sound effect.

**●** **Copy-Paste Method**

You can also merge **GIFs and music videos** using the direct copy-paste method in the Kapwing Editor. To create one for yourself, here's what you need to follow:

**Step 1: GIF Upload**

Select a GIF from your smartphone or PC gallery and upload it to the Kapwing Editor. You can even copy a GIF link from other apps like, YouTube, GIFHY, etc, and paste it in the editor timeline.

**Step 2: Audio Upload**

Next, you need to upload the audio file you want to get stitched with your GIF. Choose a file either from your system or copy-paste the YouTube URL of the selected video in the Kapwing timeline.

**Step 3: Export Your Creation**

That it! You are done with your creation. Click ‘Export' to share your musical GIF video on different social platforms.

Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

#### In this article

01 [How to display Pinterest’s latest pins in a slideshow? ](#Part 1)

02 [How to upload multiple photos to Pinterest?](#Part 2)

03 [How to display Pinterest’s latest pins in a slideshow? ](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow**

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**●** It would be the user's profile URL + feed/RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser's URL. That is your profile URL.

**●** For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser's URL bar.

![Construct Pinterest Feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

![Add the Slideshow Widget](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-2.jpg)

Under Source, select Other.

![Add the Slideshow Widget 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-3.jpg)

Put in the converted Pinterest RSS feed URL from step 2 into the Feed URL text box.

Click Save and view your blog.

## Part 2 **How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest**

If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

## Part 1 **How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow**

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**●** It would be the user's profile URL + feed/RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser's URL. That is your profile URL.

**●** For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser's URL bar.

![Construct Pinterest Feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

![Add the Slideshow Widget 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-3.jpg)

Click Save and view your blog.

## Part 2 **How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest**

If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so.
