## Part 1  5 Best Places to Find Animated Christmas GIFs for Free

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

![pinterest christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-2.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

If you are looking for funny Christmas GIFs, then Giphy would be one of the best places to explore. It has some of the most extensive GIFs collections of all styles, including Christmas wishes GIFs.

Tenor is another clean and user-friendly website where you can find different types of funny Merry Christmas GIFs for free. You can look for stickers and GIFs by simply entering keywords of your choice on Tenor.

## Part 2 How to Create your Animated Christmas GIFs (with Music): A DIY Guide

Most of these readily available animated Christmas GIFs are quite generic and lack a customized appeal. Therefore, if you want to come up with some customized Christmas wishes GIFs, then consider using a dedicated editing tool like Wondershare Filmora.

You can explore and use the wide range of media assets of Filmora or import anything from your system. Besides that, tons of transitions, filters, captions, and other effects would let you come up with some customized Merry Christmas wishes GIFs via Filmora in the following way.

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 2 **Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?**

It's worth noting that people commonly use built-in **OBS animated lower thirds** for the job, but you can also use other editing tools to create custom animations and import them in your OBS Livestream.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about OBS animated lower thirds and their best alternatives you can use in 2022 and beyond.

#### In this article

01 [What are Lower Thirds in Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio](#Part 2)

03 [8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?

To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.

Let's say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.

## Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio

So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let's understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It's worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an **animated lower third in OBS** studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.

When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you'll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don't have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.

Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your **OBS animated lower-third** graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you'll end up losing potential viewers.

Here's a YouTube video that'll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.

## Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives

While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don't have a high-configuration system, you won't be able to run the tool at all.

So, what's your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up **OBS animated lower-third** graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.

### 01Wirecast

![wirecast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/obs-animated-lower-thirds-alternative-02.jpg)

Like OBS, Wirecast is a popular video streaming platform that many content creators use to live stream on their social media handles. It also offers a layer-based architecture, which means users can add multiple layers separately and manage them through an easy-to-navigate panel.

One of the key reasons Wirecast is an ideal choice to add **animated lower-third** graphics to your live streams is its built-in collections. The tool already has several ready-to-integrate lower-third animations that one could import into their project without any hassle.

**Pros:**

**●** Built-in lower-third graphic templates

**●** Easy-to-use Interface

**●** Switch between multiple camera angles with one click

vMix is a feature-rich video production software that offers everything one would need to create stunning videos. However, it also has a dedicated live stream manager to manage your live streams, switch between multiple camera angles, and add overlay animations to keep the viewers engaged. Unlike OBS Studio, vMix doesn't have a layering system, which means you can overlay multiple channels easily.

As far as **OBS animated lower-thirds** are concerned, there are different ways you can add these animations to your live streams. You can either import dedicated PSD files, embed HTML codes, or choose one of the ready-to-use lower-third templates to do the job. In either case, vMix will help you add stunning lower-third animations within a few minutes.

**Pros:**

**●** Full-scale video production software

**●** Built-in support for audio mixing

**●** Add and Manage Multiple Camera Inputs

vMix is ideal for users who want to upgrade from OBS and can spend $1200 on a live stream manager. It'll provide everything you need to live stream across different social media platforms.

### 03Restream Studio

Restream is ideal for beginners who don't want to spend a hefty amount on their live streaming software. With restream, you can upload your brand logos, graphic overlays, and text details and save them in the "Favorites" tab for future use.

This way, whenever you are live streaming, you can directly choose one of these overlays and switch between them easily. The tool also has a dedicated "Hide/Show" button that'll allow you to change the display status of the lower-third animations.

### 05Adobe Photoshop

![Adobe Photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/obs-animated-lower-thirds-alternative-06.jpg)

Before you act surprised, let us clarify that Adobe Photoshop isn't an alternative to OBS Studio. However, you can use it to create customized overlays and lower-third graphics to add a personal touch to your live streams. Suppose you are already familiar with Photoshop and have been using it for a few years. In that case, it'll allow you to design personalized text overlays, graphics, animations, and logos for your live streams.

And, once you have successfully designed the lower-third overlays, you can use any of the live stream managers to add them to your live streams.

**Pros:**

**●** Design custom overlays for your social media live streams

**●** Offers advanced editing options to customize logos and lower-third graphics

**Cons:**

**Stars**: 7.9

**Votes**: 13,266

**Summary:** The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, 'Star vs. the Forces of Evil' This is an American animated 'magical-girl' television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East.

Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action/adventure show.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.

Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show. It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it's not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it's sure to provide a good time

This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn't make it any less fun

**Stars**: 8.1

**Votes**: 7,522

**Summary:** While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), 'The Owl House' is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)

The story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.
