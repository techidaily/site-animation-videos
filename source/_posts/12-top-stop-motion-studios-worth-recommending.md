You need to place all the images you wish to include in the video's final cut into a folder and arrange them the same way as they should appear in the video. Even though **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** provides powerful video editing tools that enable you to improve the colors in the footage you are syncing with, it is best to edit your photos via dedicated photo editing software.

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab. Moreover, you should also import all audio files you would like to use in your project before doing any actual editing. When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04\.

You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the **Play** button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.

**Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right**

When you start to convert **mp4 to GIF using Photoshop**, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.

The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.

Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.

**Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop**

Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.

The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The "From Beginning to End" is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select "Selected Range Only." On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.

Last but not least, check the "Make Frame Animation" checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames.

## Part 1 **Do You Remember the Very Popular Simpsons?**

The Simpsons is an American animated cartoonist Matt Groening created for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a "golden age."

The **popular cartoon** series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.

However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750\. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.

Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.

The **popular cartoon** series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.

However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750\. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.

Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.

However, here are the ten best cartoon shows that have existed since the Simpsons:

### 01Futurama

This **popular cartoon** series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that's pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-3.jpg)

### 02The Critic

This cartoon series was first created in 1994 by the Simpson's writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss. This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor's non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz's Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-4.jpg)

### 03Bojack Horseman

Bojack Horseman is a **dumb cartoon character** series first created on August 22, 2014\. However, four (4) days later, the series was renewed for a second season, released on July 17, 2015\. It is often a searing portrait of addiction, failure, depression, etc., as humans talk to a horse.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-5.jpg)

### 04Family Guy

Family Guy, the **snoopy cartoon** series, was first created on January 31, 1999, which goes for anything for a laugh style. However, you might not like the Griffin family or the other residents of Quahog, but you have to admit that the show stumbles on a great joke.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-6.jpg)

### 05South Park

South Park debuted with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe, " first created on August 13, 1997\. Although it started with some cheap animations, it has become one of the iconic animated shows.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-7.jpg)

### 06Batman: The Animated Series

The Batman animated cartoon series, created on September 5, 1992, is a favorite for many people, although it is more comedy than an animated drama.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-8.jpg)

### 07Gravity Falls

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 07](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-9.jpg)

This **popular cartoon** animated series was first created in 1983 by cartoonists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. This cartoon series is the definitive version, brightly colored and fun and fluffy.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 08](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-10.jpg)

### 09Doug

This cartoon animated series was first created on March 26, 1999, by Jim Jinkins and produced by Jumbo Pictures. It was one of the first animated shows on Nickelodeon before moving to Disney pictures. However, this show is creative and down-to-earth at the same time.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 09](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-11.jpg)

### 10Hey Arnold

### 02How to Draw Captain America

Follow these simple steps to make a Disney cartoon drawing of Captain America:

**Step 1**: Draw the head and chest

Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.

![draw the head and chest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-12.jpg)

**Step 2**: Draw his arm and waist

Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.

![sketch his waist and arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-13.jpg)

**Step 3**: Draw his legs

Here, we shall portray Captain America in action. Use curved lines to show his extended right leg with boots. The left leg should appear more petite.

![draw his legs in boots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-14.jpg)

**Step 4**: Draw his shield

Against his right arm, carefully draw a flattened circular shape. You can achieve this by drawing concentric circles with a large star in the middle. Draw his arm poking out from behind his shield.

![draw his shield on his arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-15.jpg)

**Step 5**: Include the final details

![add the final details](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-16.jpg)

**Step 6**: Colour Captain America

### 03How to Draw Stitch

Stitch is a bulletproof and fireproof alien from the Lilo and Stitch animations. Here's how you can draw Stitch:

**Step 1**: Draw a circle that would form Stitch's head

![draw a circle for its head](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-18.jpg)

**Step 2**: Using a long curved line, draw an irregular peanut shape beneath the head to represent its body.

![draw the body pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-19.jpg)

**Step 3**: To form its light underbelly, enclose a small shape parallel to the outline of Stitch's body using a long curved line. On the chest region, draw a series of small "V" shapes to indicate the presence of fur.

![draw its underbelly and chest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-20.jpg)

**Step 4**: Draw Stitch's arm using curved lines for the upper arm and another pair for the lower arm. Draw his bent hands and fingers using short lines. At the tip of its fingers, draw small pointed triangles to represent its claws.

![draw its arm, fingers, and claws](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-21.jpg)

**Step 5**: Erase the guidelines from Stitch's arm

![remove the guidelines](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-22.jpg)

**Step 6**: Draw Stitch's outstretched arm using a pair of curved lines and small "C" shaped lines to represent the fingers. Use short lines to connect the fingers. Draw small "V" shapes at the tip of the fingers for the triangular claws.

![draw its outstretched arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-23.jpg)

![draw Stitch's legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-24.jpg)

**Step 8**: Sketch the ears using long curved lines to indicate the base and folds. Sketch the fur on top of Stitch's head using a series of curved lines.

![sketch the ears and fur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-25.jpg)

**Step 9**: Draw a big circle for the nose and use curved lines to indicate the nostrils. For the eyes, draw irregular rounded shapes, one within the other. Sketch too long curved lines to show the mouth and small blonde triangles for the teeth. Above the eyes and nose, draw curved lines.

![draw the face features](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-26.jpg)
