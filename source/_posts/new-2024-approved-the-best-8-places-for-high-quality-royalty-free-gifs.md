02 [Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?](#Part 2)

03 [The Best 8 Places for High-Quality Royalty Free Gifs (Paid and Free)](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 2 **Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?**

All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not **copyright-free GIFs.** However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.

You may not copy, modify, publish, transmit, distribute, perform, or display any content for commercial purposes or in any way violate these Terms of Service. Except for content in the public domain or the content you have permission to use in connection with the use of the Services and compliance with these Terms of Service.

Copyright laws in the United States and around the world protect their Services. Giphy has the right (but not the obligation) to remove, block, edit, or alter any content any time, without any notice, for any reason or no reason at all. Giphy, however, reserves the right to access, read, store, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is required to comply with applicable laws or protect our, our users' and the public's rights, property, or safety.

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 2 **Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?**

Step 1:

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**Step 7:** Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

![how to draw with colour 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-6.jpg)

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

You may have heard of Anime. **What is Anime?** Anime, Manga, and Cartoons all are the exquisite openings of little portals into the other worlds that will entertain, delight, and educate you at the same time. They are the forms of art and words creating a unique medium for sharing the realities of the world, spirituality, and ideas.

The digital world has grown so immensely, and then Amine, Manga, and Cartoon have become popular in the whole world that people often confuse these terms. To understand them better and to decode the myth of anime, manga, and cartoon, we’ll go deeper into each and see what anime is, and show the differences in anime, manga, and cartoon.

* [**Part 1:** **What is Anime?**](#part1)
* [**Part 2:** **What is Manga?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3:** **What is Cartoon?**](#part3)
* [**Part 4:** **Differences between Anime, Manga, and Cartoon**](#part4)

## **Part 1: What is Anime?**

Anime is the Japanese form of animation – word for word. This scrupulous style and form of animation originated in Japan characterized by its vivid imagination and bright color usage. The thematic elements of fantasy and fiction combined with science give this style its unique look and feel. This meticulously thought and designed animation is nowadays produced all around the world intending its huge fanbase not just in the Japanese but all over the world.

The story is behind the word anime is interesting – the Japanese animēshiyon is a loanword from English animation, which then made its journey back to English as anime. So, the Japanese borrowed it from English and the English took it back modified. This modified version of animation became the basis of many popular TV shows and movies that excite people to know more about anime.

Note

**Subbed Anime and Dubbed Anime**

There are two common ways to enjoy the anime world, subbed anime and dubbed anime. A “sub” is an anime-type that is shown in its original Japanese voice with subtitles of another language (mostly English). While the “dub” anime is the one that is released with a new re-scripted voice – voice actors speaking another language recorded as voiceover to make it suitable for a worldwide audience.

Though the topic is often a debatable topic among anime fandom. I’ll just highlight my thoughts on both versions. As anime is mostly Japanese creation and watching them in the western world required either an English subtitle or dubbed over by English-speaking voice actors.

Anime hardcore fans or purists argue the original voice and theme of the anime should not be altered to keep the original imaginative flair and theme of the series. While the dubbed anime released with a re-scripted voice track translated into English or any other language for that matter to allow a larger audience to enjoy the anime series without the hassle of reading through the subtitles.

## **Part 2: What is Manga?**

Manga, on the other hand, is the Japanese version of comic books and graphic novels. It has the same detailed and amplified facial features with a vivid and bright color combination. The Japanese word manga came from man-, meaning aimless, while, -ga, means pictures. So, it means aimless pictures.

Manga is unlike the usual superhero comics such as Marvel Comics or D.C. Comics written by many writers and editorial boards. Manga is more detailed and complete like novels that often are the vision of a single author. Mostly following the lives of seemingly ordinary people to develop an interesting and engaging experience – a cliffhanger.

## **Part 3: What is Cartoon?**

The word cartoon comes from the Italian word cartoon meaning a large sheet of card or paper. The word cartoon generally signifies a visual art as animation or a funny drawing while in a historical perspective it can refer to a preparatory drawing for an oil painting, fresco, or tapestry. A cartoon in literal meaning is a caricature intended as satire or a one-dimensional non-realistic or semi-realistic portrayal.

Did you see Mr Bean Cartoon? A cartoon can be animated, a motion picture of a sequence of illustrations causing it to feel like a moving caricature. In the 19th century, cartoons were humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers transforming into comic strips and animated films in the early 20th century, as we know them now.

## **Part 4: Differences between Anime, Manga, and Cartoon**

Here we will talk about the differences between anime, manga, and cartoon from the following three aspects:

### **1\. Relation**

To effectively understand the difference between anime and manga you need to remember this little trick for anime vs manga,

* Most manga can be never converted to an anime series. But numerous manga serves as a basis for anime. Put in another way – anime is mostly, but not always, is the animated form of manga.
* Anime and manga are character-oriented where characters have goals in life that play a large thematic role in their life and the stories revolve around that.
* However, the cartoon vs manga and anime is another story altogether,
* In the western world comics and novels became animated cartoons with the advent of the digital age. In Japanese and wider Asia, the manga which is the Japanese version of comics and print cartoons turned into animated cartoons – anime.

### **2\. Content**

* Anime is a distinctive art form with diverse production techniques, it amalgamates graphic art, cinematography, characterization, and other imaginative techniques. Anime is hand-drawn, which separates it from reality into the fiction realm that provides an ideal path for the fantasy world.
* Manga showcases an illuminative and vivid imagination of the creator in the form of magazines and publications. The content incites the reader to engage deep into the artistic world of the creator.
* A cartoon is also a form of art, including and not limited to humorous illustrations, political and satirical drawings, and animated films. From art to entertainment, and political commentary, cartoons play an essential role in influencing the world.

### **3\. Style**

* While the western design cartoon has its specific features and details and the Japanese manga and anime have their rich history and imaginative flair to them. On the whole, they are part of the same family of art and human illustration techniques developed to showcase the tingling visualization of the creator.

## **Conclusion**

The Japanese storytelling is so rich and vibrant filled with dynamic characters and caricatures which serve as the best entertaining setting for both children and adults. All of these art forms have their dedicated audience which reveres one or the other. Creators that depict their vivid imagination into eloquent and exquisite characters conveying some message and thought-provoking idea. So, altogether none is better than the other and there are millions and millions of people reading and watching all these forms of artistic mastery. Just pick the one you love!

This modified version of animation became the basis of many popular TV shows and movies that excite people to know more about anime.

Note

**Subbed Anime and Dubbed Anime**

There are two common ways to enjoy the anime world, subbed anime and dubbed anime. A “sub” is an anime-type that is shown in its original Japanese voice with subtitles of another language (mostly English). While the “dub” anime is the one that is released with a new re-scripted voice – voice actors speaking another language recorded as voiceover to make it suitable for a worldwide audience.

Though the topic is often a debatable topic among anime fandom. I’ll just highlight my thoughts on both versions. As anime is mostly Japanese creation and watching them in the western world required either an English subtitle or dubbed over by English-speaking voice actors.

Anime hardcore fans or purists argue the original voice and theme of the anime should not be altered to keep the original imaginative flair and theme of the series. While the dubbed anime released with a re-scripted voice track translated into English or any other language for that matter to allow a larger audience to enjoy the anime series without the hassle of reading through the subtitles.

## **Part 2: What is Manga?**

Manga, on the other hand, is the Japanese version of comic books and graphic novels. It has the same detailed and amplified facial features with a vivid and bright color combination. The Japanese word manga came from man-, meaning aimless, while, -ga, means pictures. So, it means aimless pictures.

Manga is unlike the usual superhero comics such as Marvel Comics or D.C. Comics written by many writers and editorial boards. Manga is more detailed and complete like novels that often are the vision of a single author. Mostly following the lives of seemingly ordinary people to develop an interesting and engaging experience – a cliffhanger.

## **Part 3: What is Cartoon?**

The word cartoon comes from the Italian word cartoon meaning a large sheet of card or paper. The word cartoon generally signifies a visual art as animation or a funny drawing while in a historical perspective it can refer to a preparatory drawing for an oil painting, fresco, or tapestry. A cartoon in literal meaning is a caricature intended as satire or a one-dimensional non-realistic or semi-realistic portrayal.

Did you see Mr Bean Cartoon? A cartoon can be animated, a motion picture of a sequence of illustrations causing it to feel like a moving caricature. In the 19th century, cartoons were humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers transforming into comic strips and animated films in the early 20th century, as we know them now.

## **Part 4: Differences between Anime, Manga, and Cartoon**

Here we will talk about the differences between anime, manga, and cartoon from the following three aspects:

### **1\. Relation**

To effectively understand the difference between anime and manga you need to remember this little trick for anime vs manga,

* Most manga can be never converted to an anime series. But numerous manga serves as a basis for anime. Put in another way – anime is mostly, but not always, is the animated form of manga.
* Anime and manga are character-oriented where characters have goals in life that play a large thematic role in their life and the stories revolve around that.
* However, the cartoon vs manga and anime is another story altogether,
* In the western world comics and novels became animated cartoons with the advent of the digital age. In Japanese and wider Asia, the manga which is the Japanese version of comics and print cartoons turned into animated cartoons – anime.

### **2\. Content**

* Anime is a distinctive art form with diverse production techniques, it amalgamates graphic art, cinematography, characterization, and other imaginative techniques. Anime is hand-drawn, which separates it from reality into the fiction realm that provides an ideal path for the fantasy world.
* Manga showcases an illuminative and vivid imagination of the creator in the form of magazines and publications. The content incites the reader to engage deep into the artistic world of the creator.
* A cartoon is also a form of art, including and not limited to humorous illustrations, political and satirical drawings, and animated films. From art to entertainment, and political commentary, cartoons play an essential role in influencing the world.

### **3\. Style**

* While the western design cartoon has its specific features and details and the Japanese manga and anime have their rich history and imaginative flair to them. On the whole, they are part of the same family of art and human illustration techniques developed to showcase the tingling visualization of the creator.

## **Conclusion**

The Japanese storytelling is so rich and vibrant filled with dynamic characters and caricatures which serve as the best entertaining setting for both children and adults. All of these art forms have their dedicated audience which reveres one or the other. Creators that depict their vivid imagination into eloquent and exquisite characters conveying some message and thought-provoking idea. So, altogether none is better than the other and there are millions and millions of people reading and watching all these forms of artistic mastery. Just pick the one you love!

**Architecture Animation** is the practice of creating a 3D Animation of a structure. A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating **3D Architectural Animation** that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.

#### In this article

01 [What is Architectural 3D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design](#Part 2)

03 [5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

![Explore Real Estate Projects with Architecture Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation1.png)

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

![Making Changes to Architectural Plans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation8.png)

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

![Promote Your Services with Architectural Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation9.png)

## Part 3 **5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio**

If your goal is to eventually make a name for yourself in the world of **3D Animation Architecture,** then it's a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with some of the more popular 3D Animation Services and Studios (who provide the kind of service required to create **architectural animations** like that you see in **Studio Ghibli Architecture**)

### 01**VisEngine**

The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is "VisEngine." They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you're curious as to the look of their finished **architectural animations**, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out

### 02**Exodo Animation Studios**

"Exodo Animation Studios" is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They've had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI

### 03**Promoshin**

Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn't mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they've worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)

### 04**ZOA Studio**

ZOA Studio brings us back to **Architecture Animation** services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it's a great resource for those looking for inspiration)

### 05**Studio Aiko**

Again, this next studio, called "Studio Aiko" is usually better known for its regular 3D Animation work. However, that doesn't mean that their **architectural animations** are any lesser in quality They produce very high-quality work fit for any kind of media platform. Making it a fitting solution for many professional architects

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Architectural Animations are now a staple for real estate projects. What with architects and construction engineers alike preferring to work with designers who can hand over a detailed look of their vision from the onset.

**●** There are many other benefits to **3D Architectural Animation**, of course, amongst which is better communication between you, as the designer, and your partners and clients **Architecture Animation** breathes life into a vision that may have previously existed only in your mind, and it smooths misunderstandings and eases progress

**●** If you're looking to start a career in **3D Animation Architecture**, we recommend that you look into some of the more popular service providers and studios in your area YouTube is a good platform to start looking if you're unsure.

A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating **3D Architectural Animation** that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.

03 [5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

![Making Changes to Architectural Plans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation8.png)

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

**Step 4:** You can draw the mouth just below the nose and draw any of the shapes from the list given below. In addition, to make the mouth funnier, you should then add teeth by either drawing a small square sticking out inside the mouth from the upper side, at the roof of the mouth, or a straight horizontal line which is across the mouth and several vertical lines used to form a grid having two rows and many columns.

**●** A U-shaped curve that is large

Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.

**●** First, you draw the face but make sure you don't add a nose but do a black outline.

**●** Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don't use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.

**●** Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.

**●** Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-8.png)

**Step 2:** Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?

![how to draw your own cartoon character 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-9.png)

**Step 3:** Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png)

**Step 4:** Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-11.png)

**Step 5:** Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-12.png)

**Step 6:** Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-13.png)

**Step 7:** Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 07](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-14.png)

**Step 8:** You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 08](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-15.png)

**Step 9:** Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 09](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-16.png)

![how to draw your own cartoon character 11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-18.png)

**Step 12:** You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-19.png)

**Step 7:** Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.

**Step 8:** You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.

**Step 9:** Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.
