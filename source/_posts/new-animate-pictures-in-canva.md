#### Step 1: Add Static Elements

Start by creating an image through static elements. To make the design attractive, you can add sample texts, illustrations, doodles, and other entities.

## Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?

### 1\. Start With a Script

If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It'll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg)

If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you'll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you'll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.

### 2\. Record the Voiceover

The next step in our **Adobe Animate character tutorial** is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.

![voice over](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg)

Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.

### 3\. Start Creating the Character

At this point in our **Adobe animate character tutorial**, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you'll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it'll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.

![character development in animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg)

Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you'll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.

If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it'll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.

## Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?

## Pencil2D Animation Tutorial Overview

Animation is one of the trendiest technologies. The basics of animation were formulated in the 2000s from the moving page trick. The first few animators learned that animation is nothing but continuous switching of frames from one to another. One animated still is switched to another and then another in a quick sequence such that it makes a sequential moving frame. Today, animation has come a long way from where it started and today it is used for several commercials, tutorials, and even educational lecture videos.
