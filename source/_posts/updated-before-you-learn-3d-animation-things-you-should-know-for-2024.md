Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

![2d animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3danimation-01.jpeg)

animations are like the ones Dreamworks, Pixar, produce. They include the avengers, the bad guys, etc.

Several 3D animation software exists in the market, both free and paid. If you are a **animation** creator or love animation for fun, you can use the free software to make your videos, **cartoon photos, 3d cartoon faces,** etc.

With many **animation** software available in the market, you can only fully trust a few.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

The **Adobe Auto rigger** is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of **Adobe 3D Rigging**.) It's a perfect tool for beginners.

Especially those that aren't really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.

#### In this article

01 [What's Adobe Auto Rigger?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?](#Part 2)

03 [Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's Adobe Auto Rigger?**

Alright, so what is the **Adobe Auto Rigger** and how does it differ from **Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging** or **Adobe After Effects Rigging**? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.

It's all thanks to the third-party tool, **Mixamo**, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually **rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects**.) We'll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.

Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you're intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)

![Adobe Auto Rigger Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome1.png)

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

![Upload Custom Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome2.png)

### 02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters

The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters' tab (shown in the image below.)

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

![Browse for Auto-Rigged Characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome3.png)

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

![Adobe 3D Rigging with Mixamo Adobe Auto Rigger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome4.png)

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

The **Adobe Auto rigger** is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of **Adobe 3D Rigging**.) It's a perfect tool for beginners.

Especially those that aren't really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.

## Part 1 **What's Adobe Auto Rigger?**

Alright, so what is the **Adobe Auto Rigger** and how does it differ from **Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging** or **Adobe After Effects Rigging**? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.

It's all thanks to the third-party tool, **Mixamo**, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually **rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects**.) We'll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.

Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you're intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn't mean that you cannot design **2D animations with Unity**.

In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.

#### In this article

01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

![animations in unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg)

That's it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.

## Part 3 Part 3 Creating 2D Animations for Your Videos - An Effective Solution for Video Editors

Now, when it comes to creating 2D animations for videos, you may not want to use a tool like Unity to get the job done. Why? Because Unity is more suitable for animating objects for games. Not to mention, Unity has a steep learning curve and if you are not an experienced Unity developer, you may fail to create a 2D animation properly.

So, if you only need a 2D animation for videos, we have a better alternative for the job. Instead of Unity, you can use **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** for the job. It's a full-scale video editing software that's specifically designed to edit high-quality videos. Whether you are a YouTube or simply edit videos for your clients, using Wondershare Filmora will help you showcase your creativity more effectively.

02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

A new window will open where you will see different recording options.
