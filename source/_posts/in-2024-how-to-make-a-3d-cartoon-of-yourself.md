## Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it

We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.

![voila ai artist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-make-3d-cartoon-of-yourself-01.jpg)

The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.

**●** Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone's Camera rolling permission.

**●** Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature & and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.

**●** Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a **celebrities** option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.

**●** Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D & Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.

If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free & watermark free animated representations.

## Part 2 How to Create a 3D Cartoon of Yourself for Meta

Facebook only recently rebranded themselves as Meta. This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.

Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.

Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.

The process behind creating a **3D cartoon of yourself** for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.

Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.

## Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo

Photoshop is no doubt one of the most influential digital assets that allow you to do virtually anything with your photos. Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.

There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.

Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.

![create 3d cartoon photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-make-3d-cartoon-of-yourself-02.jpg)

Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;

**●** To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.

**●** You can then ‘liquify' these layers to form a mould for your image.

**●** Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.

**●** Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.

**●** You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.
