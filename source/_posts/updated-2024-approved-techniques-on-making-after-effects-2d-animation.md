The best part about cartoons is that there's something for everyone. There are **iconic cartoon characters** that are humorous, cute, and cool.

Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

**Created:** 1941  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** William Hanna and various other voices

The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer's theatrical short films.

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

![charlie brown and snoopy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-6.jpg)

**Created:** 1950  
**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz  
**Voice:** Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

![Scooby doo and shaggy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-8.png)

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

![winnie the pooh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-9.jpg)

**Created:** 1926  
**Creators:** A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard  
**Voice:** Sterling Holloway. Hal Smith. Jim Cummings

The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.

Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children's books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie's friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.

### 10Pinky & the Brain

![pinky and the brain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-10.jpg)

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![powerpuff girls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-11.jpg)

**Created:** 1998  
**Creator:** Craig McCracken  
**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

The best part about cartoons is that there's something for everyone. There are **iconic cartoon characters** that are humorous, cute, and cool.

Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

**Created:** 1941  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** William Hanna and various other voices

The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer's theatrical short films.

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

![charlie brown and snoopy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-6.jpg)

**Created:** 1950  
**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz  
**Voice:** Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

![Scooby doo and shaggy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-8.png)

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

The best part about cartoons is that there's something for everyone. There are **iconic cartoon characters** that are humorous, cute, and cool.

Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

**Created:** 1941  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** William Hanna and various other voices

The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer's theatrical short films.

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

![charlie brown and snoopy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-6.jpg)

**Created:** 1950  
**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz  
**Voice:** Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

![Scooby doo and shaggy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-8.png)

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

![winnie the pooh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-9.jpg)

**Created:** 1926  
**Creators:** A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard  
**Voice:** Sterling Holloway. Hal Smith. Jim Cummings

The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.

Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children's books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie's friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.

### 10Pinky & the Brain

![pinky and the brain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-10.jpg)

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![powerpuff girls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-11.jpg)

**Created:** 1998  
**Creator:** Craig McCracken  
**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

## Part 1 Does Adobe Have 3D Animation Software?

You'll be able to create a range of animation styles using After Effects CC once you grasp the basic concepts. This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.

Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.

Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.

This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although **Adobe 3D animation** can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.

This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.

It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.

### 01How is After Effects used?

The primary uses of After Effects categorize into three sections:

**Effects**,

**Animation**, and

**Compositing.**

The kind of animation for which After Effects is widely used is Motion Graphics, which includes making the motion of traditionally static objects such as text, logos, and other graphic elements.

Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.

It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.

### 02Who uses After Effects?

The After Effects is valuable to animators, visual artists, advertising agencies, video editors, video artists, video producers, social media professionals, motion graphics designers, UX professionals, etc. Gaining proficiency in After Effects comes in-depth from training, tutorials, and other hands-on use courses.

Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn't mean that you cannot design **2D animations with Unity**.

In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.

#### In this article

01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

![animations in unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg)

That's it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.

## Part 3 Part 3 Creating 2D Animations for Your Videos - An Effective Solution for Video Editors

Now, when it comes to creating 2D animations for videos, you may not want to use a tool like Unity to get the job done. Why? Because Unity is more suitable for animating objects for games. Not to mention, Unity has a steep learning curve and if you are not an experienced Unity developer, you may fail to create a 2D animation properly.

So, if you only need a 2D animation for videos, we have a better alternative for the job. Instead of Unity, you can use **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** for the job.

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

That's it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.
