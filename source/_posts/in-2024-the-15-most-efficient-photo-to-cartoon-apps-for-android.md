When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend.

We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites.

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

AnyMaking is a basic online photo editor that comes with a variety of photo effects that you can apply to your photographs to change their looks. Much like the previous tools, AnyMaking offers ‘animation’ style filters that can turn your photographs into something that looks like they came from one of your favorite animated films.

**●** Turn your photographs completely anew with fun photo effects.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Animation is quite a broad subject and, fittingly, that means that the tools that allow for it are varied indeed.

**●** Some photo to animation converters will allow you to completely change the look of your photograph with a single application of a filter. While others are more involved (and thus, more flexible) and require more careful customization.

**●** We’ve included both types (and all the types between) in our list of photo to animation converters. Hopefully, you’ll find one that can help you make the animated pictures that you want to make.
