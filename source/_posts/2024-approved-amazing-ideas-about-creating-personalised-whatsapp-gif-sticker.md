The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.

Think of the text font you’re going to use.

![Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png)

Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.

![Animated elements Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png)

You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.

Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.

### 2.1 Image

To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.

For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don't. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.

The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.

The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.

### 2.2 Text

Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.

### 2.3 Video

If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.

Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.

With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.

On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.

![Canva playback animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-6.png)

If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.

You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”

If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.

Some tips you can keep in mind while creating logo are as follows:

**●** Be specific to your brand. Be sure that you are not choosing a logo that may deviate customers from your brand perspective.

**●** Always choose colors in contrast because a single color logo does not seem to be appealing.

**●** Make sure to choose a template that is easy to understand. If the template seems to be difficult to understand, a user will not be able to get it.

**●** Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.

**●** Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.

**●** Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.
