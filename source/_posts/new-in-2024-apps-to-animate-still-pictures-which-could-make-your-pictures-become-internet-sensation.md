## Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?

The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.

![Rig Mapping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-01.jpg)

For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.

The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.

## Part 2 How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?
