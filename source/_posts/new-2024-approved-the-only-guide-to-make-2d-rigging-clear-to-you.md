If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

#### In this article

01 [All You Need to Know About 2D Rigging](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Difference and Connection Between 2D and 3D](#Part 2)

03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

![2D Character Looking at a Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you2.png)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

02 [What is the Difference and Connection Between 2D and 3D](#Part 2)

03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

![2D Character Looking at a Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you2.png)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

![Storyboard Creation. Creating 2D & 3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you3.png)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

(A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

## Part 1 **Should You Study 3D Animation?**

![learning 3d animation 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginners-guide-for-learning-3d-animation-02.jpg)

3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with **3D animation courses online for free** to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.

As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:

**●** Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.

**●** 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.

**●** 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.

You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:

**●** **Modeling:** The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to **learn 3D animation and graphic design courses**.

## Part 2 **Top 5 Programs for 3D Animation**

Aside from the three basic phases involved in 3D animation, there are other individual steps that and needed in 3D animation and **3D animation graphic design courses** which include:

**●** **Step 1**: creating the story and conceptualizing

**●** **Step 2**: making the 3D models

**●** **Step 3**: rigging, texturing, and animation

**●** **Step 4**: setting up the cameras and lightning

**●** **Step 5**: rendering

**●** **Step 6**: applying special effects and compositing

**●** **Step 7**: editing, music, and Foley

We do have some recommendations for you. Even more than that, we've compiled a comprehensive guide on **stop motion movies** in hopes of introducing this often-forgotten art to those that may have never thought to appreciate it before.

Complete with an introduction, some examples of great **stop motion animation movies** and a peek at what the process is usually like for the professionals working on said movies.

#### In this article

01 [What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder](#Part 2)

03 [Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films](#Part 3)

04 [How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?**

First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.

### 01**What is a Stop Motion Movie?**

The best way to introduce the concept of **stop motion animation movies** is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.

It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it's the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing 'motion' by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.

### 02**What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?**

There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever **stop motion movie** to be made? Which was "The Humpty Dumpty Circus" created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter's dolls.

You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Rudolph the Reindeer." And finally. You have "Chicken Run" which is considered the best performing **stop motion movie** of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.

## Part 2 **Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder**

Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the **stop motion movies** of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?

### 01**Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with **Lego Movie stop motion** animation. This **stop motion movie** animation style, also called 'Brickfilms', is the practice of using Lego to create **stop motion animation movies**. It's been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.

It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.

### 02**3D Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Alright, so how about 3D **stop motion movies**? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it's actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).

In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called "Tune with Tomorrow" but you might be more familiar with the title "Coraline."

## Part 3 **Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films**

Now for our list of the best **stop motion animation movies** of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the **stop motion movies** on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.

### 01**Coraline (2009)**

We mentioned this **stop motion movie** previously, but in case you haven't already watched it, it's a classic. The storytelling elements of "Coraline" really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn't all that it was chalked up to be.

### 02**The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)**

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is another **stop motion animation movie** that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington's obsession with ruining Christmas.

### 03**Chicken Run (1994)**

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.

### 04**Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)**

The next film, released in the same year as "Coraline", is called "Fantastic Mr. Fox." This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, 'Mr. Fox' and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.

### 05**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)**

Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.

### 06**Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)**

From the makers of Coraline is the **stop motion animation movie**, called "Kubo and The Two Strings" (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It's quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.

### 07**Alice (1988)**

This next stop motion film is quite unique. It's called "Alice" and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.

### 08**8\. Mary and Max (2009)**

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised 'tutorial'. It won't be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how **stop motion movies** are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

![Set Up Your Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss1.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. It's all set up for professionals and beginners alike, allowing you the freedom to create characters that are both simple and complex with ease.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Stop motion animation is a classic way of telling a story of fantastical characters and settings without having to draw everything frame by frame.

**●** It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.

**●** If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best **stop motion movies** in film history, you'll notice that they're all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)

**●** This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.

This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.

It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it's the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing 'motion' by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.

### 02**What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?**

There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever **stop motion movie** to be made? Which was "The Humpty Dumpty Circus" created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter's dolls.

You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Rudolph the Reindeer." And finally. You have "Chicken Run" which is considered the best performing **stop motion movie** of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.

## Part 2 **Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder**

Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the **stop motion movies** of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?

### 01**Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with **Lego Movie stop motion** animation. This **stop motion movie** animation style, also called 'Brickfilms', is the practice of using Lego to create **stop motion animation movies**. It's been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.

It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.

### 02**3D Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Alright, so how about 3D **stop motion movies**? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it's actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).

In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called "Tune with Tomorrow" but you might be more familiar with the title "Coraline."

## Part 3 **Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films**

Now for our list of the best **stop motion animation movies** of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the **stop motion movies** on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.

### 01**Coraline (2009)**

We mentioned this **stop motion movie** previously, but in case you haven't already watched it, it's a classic. The storytelling elements of "Coraline" really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn't all that it was chalked up to be.

### 02**The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)**

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is another **stop motion animation movie** that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington's obsession with ruining Christmas.

### 03**Chicken Run (1994)**

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.

### 04**Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)**

The next film, released in the same year as "Coraline", is called "Fantastic Mr. Fox." This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, 'Mr. Fox' and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.

### 05**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)**

Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.

### 06**Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)**

From the makers of Coraline is the **stop motion animation movie**, called "Kubo and The Two Strings" (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It's quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.

### 07**Alice (1988)**

This next stop motion film is quite unique. It's called "Alice" and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.

### 08**8\. Mary and Max (2009)**

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised 'tutorial'. It won't be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how **stop motion movies** are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Stop motion animation is a classic way of telling a story of fantastical characters and settings without having to draw everything frame by frame.

**●** It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.

**●** If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best **stop motion movies** in film history, you'll notice that they're all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)

**●** This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.
