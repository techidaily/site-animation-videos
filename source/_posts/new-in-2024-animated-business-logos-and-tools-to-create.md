Just last year, the old-school animated slapstick comedy, **Animaniacs** was revived and given new life. This **Animaniacs reboot** was a long-time in coming for many fans of the show in the 1990s. In any case, **the Animaniacs (2020)** has inspired many fans of animated movies to start to rewatch their favorites shows in the past couple of decades.

Today, in order to give these fans something to be excited over, we've compiled a list of some of the Best Animated TV shows from Disney

Alright, let's kick things off with our list As mentioned, this will be a comprehensive list of some of the best **Disney Animated Shows** that you can watch right now We've ordered them by popularity so that you can have an easier time trying to figure out what to watch

Of course, if you're more interested in actually learning about how to create your own animated shows, you may be interested in looking in a different direction For that, we recommend looking towards the premium video editor, **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** — which comes packed with everything that you can possibly want in order to begin exploring the realm of animation

## Top 10 **Star vs. the Forces of Evil**

**Duration**: 2015–2019 \[4 Seasons, 22m per episode\]

**Genre**: Animation, Action, Adventure

**Rating**: TV-Y7

**Metascore**: N/A

**Director**: Aaron Hammersley, Dominic Bisignano, Brett Varon, Sabrina Cotugno, Piero Piluso, Tyler Chen, Giancarlo Volpe, David Wasson, Michael Mullen , John Davis Infantino, and Amelia Lorenz.

**Stars**: 7.9

**Votes**: 13,266

**Summary:** The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, 'Star vs. the Forces of Evil' This is an American animated 'magical-girl' television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)

The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand — only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully

## Top 9   **Gargoyles**

**Duration**: 1994–1996 \[2 Seasons, 30m per episode\]

**Genre**: Animation, Action, Adventure

**Director**: Dennis Woodyard, Frank Paur, Kazuo Terada, Saburo Hashimoto, Bob Kline, Takamitsu Kawamura, and Butch Lukic.

**Stars**: 8.1

**Votes**: 15,813

**Summary:** We go back into the older **Disney animated shows** a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called 'Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles' instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action/adventure show.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)
