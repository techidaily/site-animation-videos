Motion graphics are generally represented with moving images, text, and other objects and these graphics can easily display information with the help of moving objects such as the moving website logo, blurring text, bars in graphs, etc. Simply we can say the motion graphics can display the letters and shapes in the motion of the user’s choice. Sometimes things are very hard to explain with the still images whereas with the help of a few seconds of motion graphics you can clear everything perfectly.

If we talk about animation then this is a term under which motion graphics falls. Animation is used for more than 1years. So, we can say motion graphics are a part of animation itself. Any technique in the world which helps users to move static images or objects is known as animation. It can be Claymation, anime, cartoons, or motion graphics.

Let me ask you a question - how much fun would it be if you could create your own animated stickers and send them to your friends and family members on Whatsapp?

Well, to tell you the truth, it is possible to create **Whatsapp cartoons** and stickers, and the best part is you don’t need any technical expertise to get the job done.

You can also rely on several third-party sticker designer applications to get the job done. So, if you have been looking for a way to use your own face as an animated sticker in Whatsapp, continue reading. In this guide, we’ll walk you through different ways to create and upload a custom cartoon sticker in Whatsapp and make your Whatsapp chats more fun.

Now, before we go any further, I would like to point out that Whatsapp doesn’t allow users to directly create a custom cartoon sticker.

Based on which platform you use to access Whatsapp, you can choose a wide variety of Whatsapp animated sticker creators and use them to design custom cartoon stickers to make traditional Whatsapp conversations more fun.

One of the easiest ways to create custom stickers for Whatsapp is to use Wondershare **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

### 01Prepare the Simple Logo

In every situation, you'll first have to prepare the simple one-dimension logo that you've been using so far. To create this logo, you can use a wide variety of tools such as Adobe Photoshop or even a simple logo maker such as Canva. Keep in mind that you should implement all the customization on the design during this stage only.

### 02Import the Logo File

The next step towards creating the animated logo is to simply import your logo file into the tool that you want to use to do the job. For instance, if you are planning to use Adobe After Effects, simply click "File > Open" and select the logo file to load it into AE's editing panel. Once the file is successfully imported, you can move towards the next step.

### 03Choose the Right Animation Template

Now, you can proceed towards choosing the right animation template for your animated logo. It doesn't matter which software you're using for **creating an animated logo**, you'll find dozens of built-in templates that can be integrated into the design with one click. Choose any of these templates and move towards the next step.

### 04Apply the Keyframes

After you've successfully imported the file and chosen a dedicated animation template, the next step would be to apply the keyframes. In tools like After Effects, you'll find a built-in slider that'll allow you to adjust the keyframes to customize the animation.

### 05Make the Final Adjustments

Finally, make the final adjustments to the animation. For instance, you can customize the color scheme or color-grade the logo for better visual appearance. You can also add other objects on top of the design to enhance the overall quality of the logo.

Click on the ‘+’ symbol in the theme toolbar to add a new slide followed by choosing its layout, double click inside the placeholder text to edit the same or drag and drop an image from your device gallery or the internet to replace the preset one in the template.

**Step 3: Supplement Your Presentation With Objects**

Proceed to add different slideshow objects in your creation by navigating to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the top and selecting tables, charts, shapes, text boxes, comments, etc., that you wish to add in your presentation.

You can further make changes in the color, shadow and border of the object to improvise its appearance, or prefer applying a preset object style to enhance the overall object look to bring it in line with the slideshow theme. To do this, select the object and you will see its formatting options in the sidebar at the right. Click on the ‘Format Toolbar’ if the sidebar does not appear.

You can additionally, add layers to the slide objects, change their size or nest them within a shape or text box and link objects to switch to a new slide, open a related web page or email message.

**Step 4: Add Audio-Visual Elements**

Try adding suitable media elements to your creation by dragging a video or music file from your system either to a media placeholder or just anywhere within the slide. You can alternatively tap on the ‘Media’ icon in the top toolbar and choose ‘Music’ or ‘Movies’ from the dropdown that appears, followed by dragging the file with the previously explained method.

To add a soundtrack to the presentation, click on the ‘Soundtrack’ icon in the toolbar at the top, followed by clicking on the ‘Audio’ tab in the sidebar that appears. Next, tap the ‘+’ icon to select specific songs or playlists you want to add in the soundtrack.

**Step 5: Add Stunning Animations**

Start with selecting a slide to add the animation effect in the ‘Slide Navigator’. The ‘Animate’ sidebar appears, where you need to select the ‘Add an Effect’ option. Scroll down to view and choose a desired transition.

You can see a preview of the selected transition being played, with the slide navigator displaying a blue mark at the right corner of the slide to indicate the addition of a transition.

To change a previously selected transition, navigate to the sidebar at the top and tap ‘Change’ to select a new one. You can further, use the sidebar options to set the direction and transition play duration.

**Step 6: Playing Your Slideshow**

When satisfied with your effort, you can prefer playing the presentation, either in full screen or in a single window. If you choose to play in full screen, navigate to the ‘Play’ menu, click on the same and select ‘Full Screen’, followed by choosing the desired slide from where you wish the presentation to start in the slide navigator.

If you want to play the slideshow in a window, select a preferred slide in the slide navigator, go to the ‘Play’ menu at the top, click on the ‘Play’ tab, followed by choosing the ‘In Window’ option. The presentation will now start with the selected slide being played in one window and the presenter in the other.

In either of the above slideshow playing modes, press ‘Esc’ from your system’s keyboard to end the presentation playing process.

**Step 7: Collaborating With Others**

Working with the Keynote Slideshow Creator, you can collaborate with others to invite people to view and edit your presentation. To give a presentation access, you can either share a web link for a public access, or invite certain people having registered Apple credentials to view your creation. You can even give editing permissions to selected viewers or allow them to invite other people to collaborate.
