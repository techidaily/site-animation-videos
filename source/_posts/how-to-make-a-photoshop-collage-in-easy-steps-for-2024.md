01 [Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?](#Part 2)

03 [Where to Rig and Animate More Characters?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?

The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.

![Rig Mapping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-01.jpg)

For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.

The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.

## Part 2 How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?

### 1\. How Do You Rig a 2d Character in an Animation?

## Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?

The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.

![Rig Mapping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-01.jpg)

For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.

The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.

## Part 2 How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?

![How to Animate Pictures in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-2.jpg)

#### Step 1: Add Static Elements

Start by creating an image through static elements. To make the design attractive, you can add sample texts, illustrations, doodles, and other entities.

Try to stimulate your creativity and come up with a layout beforehand. If possible, sketch on paper and replicate the same.

#### Step 2: Animate Your Design

Take a final glance at the layout. Make sure it's perfect. Once all the elements are placed as per your design, it's time to animate them. For that:

* Click on the white background page
* Go to the "Toolbar" section
* Select the "Animate" button

#### Step 3: Select Page Animation Style

Canva offers six animation styles, where five are for free users, and one is for pro users. To access the five animation styles, follow these steps.

* Press the "Animate" Button
* Select "Page Animations"
* There you will find options like Block, Pan, Fade, Rise, and Tumble
* Select the style as per your design

#### Step 4: Preview and Download

After selecting a page animation style, it will preview the effect. If you find it good, move on to downloading the GIF. Here's how to do so

* Go to the "Toolbar" option (present on your upper right hand)
* Choose GIF as the file type
* Check the page number and verify if it's correct
* Press the "Done" button

#### Step 5: Final GIF

After clicking on the "Done" button, your GIF will be downloaded. You will be able to see a display for five seconds. If you want to edit the image after this, click on the time button (near the "Animate" button).

So, that was all about how to animate a photo in Canva.

#### Step 3： Edit Your Image

If you know how to animate an image in Canva, editing images on Filmora is even easier. You can try the following methods:

**Animate Your Images**

* To add animation presets to the image, click on the image twice.
* Go to the "Animation Tab" and look for an animation preset.
* Drag the presets to the image for its effect

**Make Image Color Adjustments**

* Double-click on the image
* Go to the "Color" tab and then the "Color" section
* Customize the temperature, saturation, brightness, etc., as per your need.
* Press Ok.

**Change Image Duration**

You can increase the image duration to more than the default timing of 5 seconds. For that:

* Click on the image and select the "Duration" option.
* Go to the "Duration Setting" panel.
* Add the new duration timing.

**Adjust Position, Rotate/Flip, and Opacity**

* You can resize the image position through the circles and squares at the image edges.
* To flip or rotate the image, double-click on the picture. From the "Image Panel," go to "Transform" and then click on "Rotate." You can choose either "Horizontal Flip" or "Vertical Flip" to flip the images.
* Double-click on the image and click on the "Composting" option to add opacity. You can choose the blending mode or adjust the "Opacity" accordingly.

### For Mac

Filmora for Mac comes with a drag and drop feature to add transitions, animated titles, and effects. You can start a new project from scratch by clicking on "New Project". The entire process is the same as that for Windows users.

To apply animation in the images, use the motion effects option. For that,

* Click on the Image
* Go to Motion Tab
* Select a motion effect
* Double-click to apply the effect

### Conclusion

So that's how to animate photos in Canva. Hopefully, our steps will help you revamp your posts like a pro! If not Canva, you can use its alternative Filmora. It's equally prominent, user-friendly, and feature-rich.
