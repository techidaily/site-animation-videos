Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn't mean that you cannot design **2D animations with Unity**.

In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.

#### In this article

01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

![animations in unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg)

That's it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.

## Part 3 Part 3 Creating 2D Animations for Your Videos - An Effective Solution for Video Editors

Now, when it comes to creating 2D animations for videos, you may not want to use a tool like Unity to get the job done. Why? Because Unity is more suitable for animating objects for games. Not to mention, Unity has a steep learning curve and if you are not an experienced Unity developer, you may fail to create a 2D animation properly.

So, if you only need a 2D animation for videos, we have a better alternative for the job. Instead of Unity, you can use **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** for the job.

However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

![animations in unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg)

That's it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.

## Part 3 How to Create 3D Animations from a Single Still Image?

### 01Simple steps to create 3d animations from a single still image

When it comes to animation, Adobe is recognized as one of the best tools. Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:

**●** Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.

**●** Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.

**●** Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.

**●** Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called "Repousse". By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space

**●** Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.

## 6 Types of Animation You May Like

# 6 Types of Animation You May Like

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Playing around with different types of animation can be a great deal of fun and can help you decide which style is most suited to your skills and preferences. There are many [computer animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to help you experiment with, with new forms emerging all the time.

Read on to learn more about some of the most popular types of animated videos around and the steps you need to take to produce them. We will also tell you which software you need to create videos in all sorts of different styles. Let’s begin and look at six different types of animation you might like right now.

You may also like: **[10 Classical Animated Cartoon Types With Examples](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

## The list of 6 types of animation

#### 1\. Traditional animation

As you would expect, this type of animation is the kind of old classic animation drawn on paper. The characters, backgrounds and layout were normally committed to paper by hand, with each drawing being slightly different from its predecessor. The papers were placed on sheets called cels before paint was added to them. Advancements in technology mean animation can be hand-drawn before color is added via software.

Synfig Studio is a popular product for those wishing to produce videos that are traditional in look and feel. It supports a variety of layers and offers a bone system as well as sound support.

#### 2\. 2D animation

With 2D animation, movement is created in a two-dimensional environment. Characters and figures can move up, down, left or right but won’t move nearer or further away from the viewer. Many [2D animated video software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be used to make this kind of video. Pencil 2D is a leading solution noted for its simplicity and ease of use.

This type of animation is ideal for animating on the move and runs on various operating platforms. What’s also great about Pencil 2D is that it allows you to switch between raster and vector workflows quickly and is completely free to use, even if you need it for commercial purposes.

#### 3\. 3D animation

With 3D animation, you can represent real-world 3D images in a digital space. The main three processes of 3D are modeling, layout and animation plus rendering. There are many reliable solutions for 3D animation on the market, with Autodesk 3DS Max being a market leader.

This product offers simple, robust modeling, allowing you to create a wide range of environments with richly-detailed characters and enjoy high-end rendering. It is used for producing games, product design, architecture and more.

#### 4\. Clay animation

Clay animation is also called claymation and has been around for many years. In clay animation, clay pieces are used to create characters and background animation. The pieces are moved or deformed between frames so continuous motion can occur.

One leading solution for clay animation is Adobe Animate CC. With this product, you can create vector animations for apps, games, videos and more. You can publish the results quickly and can animate pretty much anything, allowing your characters to walk, talk, blink and more with ease.

## The list of 6 types of animation

#### 1\. Traditional animation

As you would expect, this type of animation is the kind of old classic animation drawn on paper. The characters, backgrounds and layout were normally committed to paper by hand, with each drawing being slightly different from its predecessor. The papers were placed on sheets called cels before paint was added to them. Advancements in technology mean animation can be hand-drawn before color is added via software.

Synfig Studio is a popular product for those wishing to produce videos that are traditional in look and feel. It supports a variety of layers and offers a bone system as well as sound support.

#### 2\. 2D animation

With 2D animation, movement is created in a two-dimensional environment. Characters and figures can move up, down, left or right but won’t move nearer or further away from the viewer. Many [2D animated video software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be used to make this kind of video. Pencil 2D is a leading solution noted for its simplicity and ease of use.

This type of animation is ideal for animating on the move and runs on various operating platforms. What’s also great about Pencil 2D is that it allows you to switch between raster and vector workflows quickly and is completely free to use, even if you need it for commercial purposes.

#### 3\. 3D animation

With 3D animation, you can represent real-world 3D images in a digital space. The main three processes of 3D are modeling, layout and animation plus rendering. There are many reliable solutions for 3D animation on the market, with Autodesk 3DS Max being a market leader.

This product offers simple, robust modeling, allowing you to create a wide range of environments with richly-detailed characters and enjoy high-end rendering. It is used for producing games, product design, architecture and more.

#### 4\. Clay animation

Clay animation is also called claymation and has been around for many years. In clay animation, clay pieces are used to create characters and background animation. The pieces are moved or deformed between frames so continuous motion can occur.

One leading solution for clay animation is Adobe Animate CC. With this product, you can create vector animations for apps, games, videos and more. You can publish the results quickly and can animate pretty much anything, allowing your characters to walk, talk, blink and more with ease.

It’s also possible to create illusions of depths via the enhanced camera tool, and new features are being added all the time.
