## Part 3 FAQs About Watching Anime Online

Here we summarized some FAQs you may be interested in when watching an anime online.

#### 1\. What is anime?

In Japan, anime refers to any animated cartoon, whereas outside Japan, it refers to cartoon videos made specifically in Japan. Anime is basically a hand or computer-drawn animated series. Owing to their gripping storylines, these series, as well as movies, have their separate fan base. Anime is set apart from other animations by characteristic doe-like eyes, spiky hairstyles, vibrant colors, and appealing visuals. Unlike other animations, anime majorly focuses on artistic cinematic effects such as panning and zooming to give realistic effects.

#### 2\. What’s the difference between Anime and Manga?

● Relation--Anime, derived from animation, implies an animated video. It is a cartoonish film or show produced in Japan. Manga, although also produced in Japan, refers to still images arranged in a book. Much like a comic book created in English-speaking countries.

● Content--Most, but not all of the anime, originate from or are based on graphic novels, i.e., manga. Manga is usually based on real-life or fictional stories. They are written and illustrated in a way to takes the reader into a fantasy world.
