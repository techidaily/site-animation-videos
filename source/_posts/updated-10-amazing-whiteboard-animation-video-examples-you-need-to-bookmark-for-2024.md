PFP stands for "Picture For Profile" or, more commonly, "Profile Picture." It is the first thing people see when they visit your profile on a social networking website. The profile owners typically upload their own images on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others at different times during the year or when anything significant happens.

Adding a photo gives your followers a chance to put a face to the name and an idea of what you look like. This allows them to better relate to you and creates a strong foundation for conversations and any other type of interactions.
