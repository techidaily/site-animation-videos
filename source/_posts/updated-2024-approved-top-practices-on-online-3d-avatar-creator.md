The story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.

**Architecture Animation** is the practice of creating a 3D Animation of a structure. A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating **3D Architectural Animation** that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.

#### In this article

01 [What is Architectural 3D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design](#Part 2)

03 [5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

![Explore Real Estate Projects with Architecture Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation1.png)

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

## Part 3 **5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio**

If your goal is to eventually make a name for yourself in the world of **3D Animation Architecture,** then it's a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with some of the more popular 3D Animation Services and Studios (who provide the kind of service required to create **architectural animations** like that you see in **Studio Ghibli Architecture**)

### 01**VisEngine**

The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is "VisEngine." They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you're curious as to the look of their finished **architectural animations**, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out

### 02**Exodo Animation Studios**

"Exodo Animation Studios" is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They've had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI

### 03**Promoshin**

Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn't mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they've worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)

### 04**ZOA Studio**

ZOA Studio brings us back to **Architecture Animation** services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it's a great resource for those looking for inspiration)

### 05**Studio Aiko**

Again, this next studio, called "Studio Aiko" is usually better known for its regular 3D Animation work. However, that doesn't mean that their **architectural animations** are any lesser in quality They produce very high-quality work fit for any kind of media platform. Making it a fitting solution for many professional architects

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Architectural Animations are now a staple for real estate projects. What with architects and construction engineers alike preferring to work with designers who can hand over a detailed look of their vision from the onset.

**●** There are many other benefits to **3D Architectural Animation**, of course, amongst which is better communication between you, as the designer, and your partners and clients **Architecture Animation** breathes life into a vision that may have previously existed only in your mind, and it smooths misunderstandings and eases progress

**●** If you're looking to start a career in **3D Animation Architecture**, we recommend that you look into some of the more popular service providers and studios in your area YouTube is a good platform to start looking if you're unsure. There, you can find many finished **architectural animations** that can serve as inspiration for future projects

**Architecture Animation** is the practice of creating a 3D Animation of a structure. A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating **3D Architectural Animation** that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

![Explore Real Estate Projects with Architecture Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation1.png)

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

Make your photo come alive by animating it. Choose from a variety of innovative animation possibilities by selecting the Animation tool. The duration of the animation can be changed using the stopwatch animation icon. It uses a slider to help in setting the duration of each animation. You can also adjust this manually.

### 2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?

Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.

One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.

Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.

Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.

### 2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?

Canva offers presentations that are similar to the explainer-style videos on Youtube. With more modifications, you can convert the presentation to a video format. You can edit individual elements in the presentation to reflect the project details and outcomes.

You can also introduce transition effects to make the presentation a smooth video. Incorporating the three other elements will be a breeze to make a video with animation.

![Video Animation in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-5.png)

Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.

Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.

This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.

Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.

## Part 3 Pricing for Canva You Should Know

Canva can be used among a multitude of users and companies. The range of access is from a single person use to teams of fifty. It also allows for a custom selection of a number of people.
