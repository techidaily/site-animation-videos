## Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone

So, now that you are familiar with the basic concept of **clay stop animation**, let’s understand how you can get started with claymation animations. Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.

When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your **stop motion claymation** doesn’t feel jerky at all.

After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.

Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the **stop motion animation claymation**. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.

This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.

### 05Plastilina

**Summary:** The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, 'Star vs. the Forces of Evil' This is an American animated 'magical-girl' television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)

The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand — only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully

**Votes**: 15,813

**Summary:** We go back into the older **Disney animated shows** a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called 'Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles' instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action/adventure show.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.

**Stars**: 5.8

**Votes**: 3,364

**Summary:** The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse sees the revival of the classic, Mickey Mouse character (who had been snubbed an extended spot on the big screen outside of the previews and was really only featured in the old film 'Fantasia) The show was a long-running one. Having aired between 2006 to 2016 with exactly 125 episodes around 30 minutes long.

The demographics for this one mainly comprises of very young children. But, if you like, it's a safe-for-viewing show that you can have your kids watch and keep distracted And, perhaps, along the way, you can find some joy in these classic characters coming back to life.

## Top 7 **A Goofy Movie**

**Duration**: 1995 \[78 min\]

**Genre**: Animation, Adventure, Comedy

**Rating**: G

**Metascore**: N/A

**Director**: Kevin Lima

**Stars**: 6.9

**Votes**: 51,043

**Summary:** The Goofy Movie is not actually a TV show, but it is a part of the list of the best **Disney animated shows** on IMDB because it was based on an established television series called 'Goof Troop' The movie saw its premiere in 1995 and it starts off a couple of years after the end of the Goof Troop show.

Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show. It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it's not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it's sure to provide a good time

**Stars**: 8.2

**Votes**: 8,826

**Summary:** Next up, we have 'Duck Tales' Duck Tales is actually a reboot, much like the **Animianics (2020)** reboot The original series, which had premiered all the way back in September of 1987, had run for over 100 episodes (with the last of the episodes having been aired in November of 1990). In any case, the nostalgia factor is strong with this one The series has inspired many adaptations. And, with its revival on Disney XD in 2015, its popularity has only continued to grow

Just in case you're unfamiliar with this zany cast of characters. It all starts off with Donald Duck, who kicks off the show by joining the US Navy and handing off the care of his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie to his uncle Scrooge McDuck

**Votes**: 41,251

**Summary:** The fourth most popular of the **Disney animated shows** on IMBD is Phineas and Ferb This is an action/comedy series that ran all from 2007 to 2015 And yes, that does mean that this show is 100% now binge-able from start to end

This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn't make it any less fun

**Summary:** While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), 'The Owl House' is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)

The story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.
