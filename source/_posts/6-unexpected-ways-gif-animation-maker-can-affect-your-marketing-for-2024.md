It's a very open subject.

### 01**GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads**

The best part of GIFs is that they are easily consumable media that you can share just about everywhere. For example, you can include them in your email marketing to bring a little life to what could have otherwise been a very dry message You can also have it play out on social media without prompting (different from videos, which the user usually has to play before it starts going.)

### 02**GIFs Can Be Used for Promoting Events**

GIFs are also great for promoting events or holiday sales It's basically just a moving 2D advertisement (like the one that is shown below). Eye-catching in a way that keeps you looking to catch the movement — in compared to if you were just looking at a still image (which might catch your attention for a moment, but usually bores you the next)

### 03**GIFs Can Be Used for Call-to-Action Pop-Ups**

Perhaps you've seen this already in some YouTube videos (see the GIF attached for an example), but a lot of content creators now include GIFs on their content to prompt their audience to complete an action — be it subscribing, sharing, downloading a link, buying a product, etc. It's a great way of getting a message across in a way that is both fun and straightforward

### 04**GIFs Can Be Used to Set the Scene and Express Emotion**

GIFs are also a great way to just generally set the scene or express emotion. Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving' pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.

### 05**GIFs Can Be Used to Tell a Story**

You know the saying, "A picture can speak a thousand words?" Well, it's true, but in comparison to GIFs??? Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example. With just one look, you can probably create an entire story in your head about the woman that is featured This can be very useful for future marketing prospects.

### 06**GIFs Can Be Used to Explain or Share Instructions**

In the same way that you can create long infographics to offer instructions or teach a lesson on a particular subject, GIFs can be used to educate your audience. Only, it's a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below

## Part 3: FAQ about Animation Maker for Kids

### 1\. How do you make animations for kids?

Despite popular belief, it isn’t too difficult to find animation makers for kids. There are even tools out there that will let kids create their animations if they are old enough.

Children nowadays can create and develop their characters – and even dream up storylines to put a motion. The School Run has lots of exciting ideas on how children can get into animation themselves.

For adults, however, a good animation maker for kids can help us submit high-end projects on a low-end pay scale, providing you use the correct software.

### 2\. What is the best animation software for beginners?

Some best include Blender, Adobe Character Animator, and Filmora by Wondershare.

You can enter existing artwork or create new ones of your own in the virtual space, all of which can be done on a drag-and-drop basis.

### 3\. What is the easiest animation software to use?

The easiest animation maker for kids that you can use as software for your own projects has to be Filmora. As well as having a ton of free features, it gives you everything you need to mask, edit, animate, and evolve all of your details. You can use it to create art if you haven’t already got something planned – or you can use it to input any file type that you like.

It has some wonderful animation-making features that let you go from high-end and professional (like logo making) to fun and playful (like animation making). Best out of all of the features is that it is easy enough for children to understand how to do it.

## Conclusion

Creating a 2D animation video is a lot easier when you have the right software available to you. You already have a script and storyboard in mind, but now you can realize your vision in intricate and unique ways.

## Part 3: FAQ about Animation Maker for Kids

### 1\. How do you make animations for kids?

Despite popular belief, it isn’t too difficult to find animation makers for kids. There are even tools out there that will let kids create their animations if they are old enough.

Children nowadays can create and develop their characters – and even dream up storylines to put a motion. The School Run has lots of exciting ideas on how children can get into animation themselves.

For adults, however, a good animation maker for kids can help us submit high-end projects on a low-end pay scale, providing you use the correct software.

### 2\. What is the best animation software for beginners?

Some best include Blender, Adobe Character Animator, and Filmora by Wondershare.

You can enter existing artwork or create new ones of your own in the virtual space, all of which can be done on a drag-and-drop basis.

### 3\. What is the easiest animation software to use?

The easiest animation maker for kids that you can use as software for your own projects has to be Filmora. As well as having a ton of free features, it gives you everything you need to mask, edit, animate, and evolve all of your details. You can use it to create art if you haven’t already got something planned – or you can use it to input any file type that you like.

It has some wonderful animation-making features that let you go from high-end and professional (like logo making) to fun and playful (like animation making). Best out of all of the features is that it is easy enough for children to understand how to do it.

## Conclusion

Creating a 2D animation video is a lot easier when you have the right software available to you. You already have a script and storyboard in mind, but now you can realize your vision in intricate and unique ways. Anyone of the products above will serve you well, but [FimoraPro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the one you should consider. Just download it now to have a try!

### 1\. How do you make animations for kids?

Despite popular belief, it isn’t too difficult to find animation makers for kids. There are even tools out there that will let kids create their animations if they are old enough.

Children nowadays can create and develop their characters – and even dream up storylines to put a motion. The School Run has lots of exciting ideas on how children can get into animation themselves.

### 2\. What is the best animation software for beginners?

Some best include Blender, Adobe Character Animator, and Filmora by Wondershare.

You can enter existing artwork or create new ones of your own in the virtual space, all of which can be done on a drag-and-drop basis.

### 3\. What is the easiest animation software to use?

The easiest animation maker for kids that you can use as software for your own projects has to be Filmora. As well as having a ton of free features, it gives you everything you need to mask, edit, animate, and evolve all of your details. You can use it to create art if you haven’t already got something planned – or you can use it to input any file type that you like.

It has some wonderful animation-making features that let you go from high-end and professional (like logo making) to fun and playful (like animation making). Best out of all of the features is that it is easy enough for children to understand how to do it.

Motion graphics first came into the scene when Oskar Fischinger and Norman McLaren were doing some experimental work. Later in 195some designers introduced motion graphics to the public in a bigger way. The designers later used in a few films that time and these films are still a great example of the motion graphics used at that time. Motion graphics in these films presented information such as the product company, actors, film directors, movie title, and many other things about the films in a very creative way.

Playing with the words or graphic elements was never seen by the people before the motion graphics. Later it’s started used in mostly all films and ad videos.

Now a day in the few years the advancement of animation software’s and the improvements in designs allowed people to learn more about motion graphics and try to produce new and eye-catching graphics.

## Part 4 Uses of Motion Graphics Today

Now a day due to the new technology every day the presence of the screen in multiple devices has extended the usage of motion graphics. **Motion graphics** are generally used in every device that has a screen such as opening the TV, introducing the information with the bumpers, and many other things. Below are a few examples where motion graphics are mainly used:

### 01Branding

Branding is the biggest channel and branding owners were looking for something different to refresh their brand and make it different from the other SKY channels. The Nerdo Creative Studio used motion graphics in their channel video and created a beautiful video with typography and text effects. This video makes it different from the other channels which generally people don’t see every day on television.

This helps brands to promote their products in front of customers in a clear way and get more sales. In the product videos, the **animated motion graphics** can help you a lot in creating entertaining, fun, and engaging eye-catching product videos.

### 03Telling a Story to the Audience

Storytelling about a brand or anything is a very complicated task because your story must be to the point and understandable by the viewers. In this case, motion graphics help a lot. For example, you can view the above video on the URL with clear images, text, icons, and great background music.

## Part 5 Motion Graphics vs. Animation: What’s the Difference?

Motion graphics are generally represented with moving images, text, and other objects and these graphics can easily display information with the help of moving objects such as the moving website logo, blurring text, bars in graphs, etc. Simply we can say the motion graphics can display the letters and shapes in the motion of the user’s choice. Sometimes things are very hard to explain with the still images whereas with the help of a few seconds of motion graphics you can clear everything perfectly.

If we talk about animation then this is a term under which motion graphics falls. Animation is used for more than 1years. So, we can say motion graphics are a part of animation itself. Any technique in the world which helps users to move static images or objects is known as animation. It can be Claymation, anime, cartoons, or motion graphics.

Mainly the content separates the motion graphics from the other types of animations because, in the motion graphic text, objects are associated with the other graphic designs.

**Subbed Anime and Dubbed Anime**

There are two common ways to enjoy the anime world, subbed anime and dubbed anime. A “sub” is an anime-type that is shown in its original Japanese voice with subtitles of another language (mostly English). While the “dub” anime is the one that is released with a new re-scripted voice – voice actors speaking another language recorded as voiceover to make it suitable for a worldwide audience.

Though the topic is often a debatable topic among anime fandom. I’ll just highlight my thoughts on both versions. As anime is mostly Japanese creation and watching them in the western world required either an English subtitle or dubbed over by English-speaking voice actors.

Anime hardcore fans or purists argue the original voice and theme of the anime should not be altered to keep the original imaginative flair and theme of the series. While the dubbed anime released with a re-scripted voice track translated into English or any other language for that matter to allow a larger audience to enjoy the anime series without the hassle of reading through the subtitles.

## **Part 2: What is Manga?**

Manga, on the other hand, is the Japanese version of comic books and graphic novels. It has the same detailed and amplified facial features with a vivid and bright color combination. The Japanese word manga came from man-, meaning aimless, while, -ga, means pictures. So, it means aimless pictures.

Manga is unlike the usual superhero comics such as Marvel Comics or D.C. Comics written by many writers and editorial boards. Manga is more detailed and complete like novels that often are the vision of a single author. Mostly following the lives of seemingly ordinary people to develop an interesting and engaging experience – a cliffhanger.

## **Part 3: What is Cartoon?**

The word cartoon comes from the Italian word cartoon meaning a large sheet of card or paper. The word cartoon generally signifies a visual art as animation or a funny drawing while in a historical perspective it can refer to a preparatory drawing for an oil painting, fresco, or tapestry. A cartoon in literal meaning is a caricature intended as satire or a one-dimensional non-realistic or semi-realistic portrayal.

In the 19th century, cartoons were humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers transforming into comic strips and animated films in the early 20th century, as we know them now.

## **Part 4: Differences between Anime, Manga, and Cartoon**

Here we will talk about the differences between anime, manga, and cartoon from the following three aspects:

### **1\. Relation**

All of these art forms have their dedicated audience which reveres one or the other. Creators that depict their vivid imagination into eloquent and exquisite characters conveying some message and thought-provoking idea.

Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Now, you have to uncheck the **Loop** **Time** tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.

Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Now, you have to uncheck the **Loop** **Time** tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.
