There's no arguing the fact that Blender is a remarkable tool for 3D animations. Its worldwide popularity is clear proof of what one can achieve while creating a 3D animation with Blender. But, the real question is - are Blender 2D animations as good as their 3D alternatives. Well, the answer is Yes! Blender has a built-in feature known as Grease Pencil that's specifically designed to create 2D animations. With Grease Pencil, you can create different 2D layouts from scratch and turn them into visually appealing animations to engage the potential viewers.

## Part 2 How to Mix 2D & 3D Animation in Blender?

So, how can you create 2D animations in Blender? Well, it depends! The process to create a 2D animation in Blender mainly depends on what you want to design. You can find different Blender 2D animation tutorials on YouTube and use them to get started with 2D animations in Blender. But, we would like to point out that there's a generic process that'll remain consistent in every situation. If you are also getting started with creating 2D animations in Blender, here's the step-by-step process that'll help you start sailing in the right direction and make the 2D animation designing a hassle-free task.

##### Step 1

First and foremost, launch Blender on your system and set it up to get started. On the home screen, click on "File>New" and then, select "2D Animation".

## Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging

As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.

## Part 2 8 Tips for Character Rigging

### 01The Right Rig for the Job

Rigging is a skill all animators gets good at overtime. The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.

You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don't. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.

### 02Deformers for Facial Rigging

Constructing a realistic facial rig can be quite a task but is indeed satisfying once finished. Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

Though you can use one without the other, it is best to use both of them in an animation. You can't work without both arms can you? Applying both Inverse and Forward Kinematics in your rig design can help it make more stylistic.

### 04Learn Python and Maya API: Learn Python and Maya API

If you wish to take your rigging skills to the next level then learning Maya API and Python are great millstones. This way, you can create high quality and sophisticated rigs with high intense flexibility on Maya. Also, Python allows you to write new scripts for PlugIns.

### 05Delegate to an Animator

After rigging for several hours it is easy to feel like you are only seeing from one perspective. Get in touch with an animator earlier on in the project can help you get feedback to stay consistent in the rigging process.

### 06Learn Web Technologies: Learn Web Technologies

To be a good animator or rigging specialist involves a lot of learning. Animation technology is constantly changing therefore it is highly recommended to stay up to date with the latest web technologies. Learning HTML, Java Script and CSS is becoming vital to being a part of the gaming world.

### 07Use Scalable Tools

Not all the characters or objects you rig are going to be of the same size. Selecting the right rigging software is crucial for you to be able to scale your animations. You won't need to use everything, just the tools that serve your purpose.

### 08Use a Clean Interface

If you have ever heard of the phrase 'clean workplace ‚Äì cleaner work' then you should know how an untidy interface can affect your workflow. This won't necessarily change the results but can surely better your experience.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **‚óè** Key Takeaways from This Episode **‚Üí**

**‚óè** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

## Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging

As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.

## Part 2 8 Tips for Character Rigging

### 01The Right Rig for the Job

Rigging is a skill all animators gets good at overtime. The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.

You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don't. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.

### 02Deformers for Facial Rigging

Constructing a realistic facial rig can be quite a task but is indeed satisfying once finished. Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

Though you can use one without the other, it is best to use both of them in an animation. You can't work without both arms can you? Applying both Inverse and Forward Kinematics in your rig design can help it make more stylistic.

### 04Learn Python and Maya API: Learn Python and Maya API

If you wish to take your rigging skills to the next level then learning Maya API and Python are great millstones. This way, you can create high quality and sophisticated rigs with high intense flexibility on Maya. Also, Python allows you to write new scripts for PlugIns.

### 05Delegate to an Animator

After rigging for several hours it is easy to feel like you are only seeing from one perspective. Get in touch with an animator earlier on in the project can help you get feedback to stay consistent in the rigging process.

### 06Learn Web Technologies: Learn Web Technologies

To be a good animator or rigging specialist involves a lot of learning. Animation technology is constantly changing therefore it is highly recommended to stay up to date with the latest web technologies. Learning HTML, Java Script and CSS is becoming vital to being a part of the gaming world.

### 07Use Scalable Tools

Not all the characters or objects you rig are going to be of the same size. Selecting the right rigging software is crucial for you to be able to scale your animations. You won't need to use everything, just the tools that serve your purpose.

### 08Use a Clean Interface

If you have ever heard of the phrase 'clean workplace ‚Äì cleaner work' then you should know how an untidy interface can affect your workflow. This won't necessarily change the results but can surely better your experience.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **‚óè** Key Takeaways from This Episode **‚Üí**

**‚óè** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

### 01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character

**These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:**

##### Step 1Start with the face

The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.

After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.

![start with face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-06.jpg)

##### Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing

![Draw the eyes by drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-07.jpg)

##### Step 3Draw eyebrows

![draw eyebrows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-08.jpg)

##### Step 4Draw jaw

After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.

##### Step 5Draw nose

Design the nose and ensure that you don't put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.

![Draw nose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-10.jpg)

##### Step 6Draw mouth

Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.

![Draw mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-11.jpg)

##### Step 7Draw ears

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

![Draw ears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg)

As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.

Nevertheless, please don't take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.

So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that's not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.

![draw haircut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-13.jpg)

### 02 Cartoon Paintings of an Old Character

**If you want your character to look old, this is the way to go:**

##### Step 1Old character draw a face

The face is no different from that of a young character. Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don't forget to add wrinkles.

Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.

![Old character draw face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-14.jpg)

### 03 Cartoon Painting of a Female Character

So far, our focus has been on a male character. So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.

The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women's facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.

The face is no different from that of a young character. Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don't forget to add wrinkles.

Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.

##### Step 2Old character make the chin

Make the chin longer too.

##### Step 3Old character draw the nose

Ensure that the nose design looks wider and larger since the character is old. To achieve that, make the nose look close to the eyes

##### Step 4Old character exaggerates mustache

Skip the mouth bit and instead go for a big, exaggerated mustache. That's one common characteristic of an old character, especially male.

##### Step 5Draw hair

When it comes to hair, bald and side hair will play the trick perfectly. The nose is no different from that of a young character.

### 03 Cartoon Painting of a Female Character

So far, our focus has been on a male character. So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.

The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women's facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.

**Cartoon painting** is slowly becoming popular due to its many benefits, especially **easy cartoon canvas painting**. For instance, it is pretty eye-grabbing, especially if your audience is children.

![cartoon painting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-00.gif)

Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.

03 [Is There Anything else You Can Do to Draw Cartoons More Quickly?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?

As far as good cartoons are concerned, expect about 5 popular types. These **cartoons to draw** include:

### 01 Illustrative Cartoons

They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.

The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.

It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.

![illustrative cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-01.jpg)

### 02 Animated Cartoons

It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.

As much as that's how they seem from the viewer's perspective, that's far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.

![Animated Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-02.jpg)

### 03 Comic Strips or Panels

In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.

Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.

The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.

![Comic Strips or Panels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-03.jpg)

### 04 Gag Cartoons

As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.

Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that's often a single sentence.

![Gag Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-04.jpg)

### 05 Editorial or Political Cartoons

These cartoons are also made for the newspapers. Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper's editorial comment.

As much as some have captions, that's not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.

## Part 2 How Do You Draw a Cartoon Character for Beginners?

Even cartoon painting experts were once beginners. So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let's get started.

### 01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character

**These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:**

##### Step 1Start with the face

The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.

After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.

![start with face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-06.jpg)

##### Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing

Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.

Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.

![Draw the eyes by drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-07.jpg)

##### Step 3Draw eyebrows

On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.

![draw eyebrows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-08.jpg)

##### Step 4Draw jaw

After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.

![draw jaw](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-09.jpg)

##### Step 5Draw nose

Design the nose and ensure that you don't put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.

![Draw nose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-10.jpg)

##### Step 6Draw mouth

Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.

![Draw mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-11.jpg)

##### Step 7Draw ears

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

![Draw ears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg)

##### Step 8Draw haircut

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.

Nevertheless, please don't take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.

So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that's not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.

![draw haircut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-13.jpg)

Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It's a good way of starting if you're not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won't demand any immediate monetary commitment.

Now, as for its features, today, we'll be focusing on **Blender Rigging** features.

#### In this article

01 [Why Use Blender Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]](#Part 2)

03 [Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Use Blender Rigging?**

**Blender Character Rigging** is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it's capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.

So, if you want to create video projects for your audience's entertainment or edification with animation, then **Blender Rigging** is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished **Blender Rigging** animations.)

![Blender Character Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes1.png)

## Part 2 **The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]**

For this next section, we're going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about **Blender Character Rigging**, **Blender Facial Rigging**, **Blender Muscle Rig**, and so on.

These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we've linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it's something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‚ÄòBlender' experience.)

### 01**Blender Character Rigging**

The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, **Blender Character Rigging**. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy **Blender character rigging**, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.

### 02**Blender Facial Rigging**

Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about **Blender Facial Rigging** from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of **Blender Rigging** tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face's character to become animated.)

### 03**Blender Muscle Rigging**

Creating a **Blender Muscle Rig** is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‚Äònext stage' as you say, with your Animations. The video that we've attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of **Blender Rigging** in general and has extensively explained how to create a **Blender Human Rig** from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.

### 04**Blender Rigging**

Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‚Äòtraditional' methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It's an especially good skill to learn if you're more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)

### 05**Blender Rigging**

This next tutorial is an introduction to basic **Blender Rigging**. It's a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.

## Part 3 **Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course**

For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about **Blender Rigging**. Whether it be about **Blender character rigging**, **Blender facial rigging**, **free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs**, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.

### 01**Where to Learn the Course?**

The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters' **blender rigging** course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.

![PluralSight ‚Äî Mark Masters Blender Rigging Course](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes2.png)

### 02**Other Tools to Learn Rigging**

As for other places to learn? We suggest the "Blender Fundamentals" course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is "Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of **Blender rigging** (including **Blender rigging** and **Blender rigging** videos.)

![Blender Fundamentals on YouTube. By Blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes3.png)

## **‚óè** Key Takeaways from This Episode **‚Üí**

**‚óè** If you're interested in trying out **blender rigging** yourself, you'll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.

**‚óè** Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.

**‚óè** For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common **Blender Rigging** subjects.

**‚óè** If you're looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master's introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender's own "Blender Fundamental" series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you'll need to know.)

Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about **Blender Facial Rigging** from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of **Blender Rigging** tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face's character to become animated.)

### 03**Blender Muscle Rigging**

Creating a **Blender Muscle Rig** is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‚Äònext stage' as you say, with your Animations. The video that we've attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of **Blender Rigging** in general and has extensively explained how to create a **Blender Human Rig** from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.

### 04**Blender Rigging**

Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‚Äòtraditional' methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It's an especially good skill to learn if you're more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)

### 05**Blender Rigging**

This next tutorial is an introduction to basic **Blender Rigging**. It's a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.

## Part 3 **Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course**

For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about **Blender Rigging**. Whether it be about **Blender character rigging**, **Blender facial rigging**, **free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs**, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.

### 01**Where to Learn the Course?**

The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters' **blender rigging** course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.

### 02**Other Tools to Learn Rigging**

As for other places to learn? We suggest the "Blender Fundamentals" course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is "Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of **Blender rigging** (including **Blender rigging** and **Blender rigging** videos.)

## **‚óè** Key Takeaways from This Episode **‚Üí**

**‚óè** If you're interested in trying out **blender rigging** yourself, you'll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.

**‚óè** Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.

**‚óè** For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common **Blender Rigging** subjects.

**‚óè** If you're looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master's introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender's own "Blender Fundamental" series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you'll need to know.)

Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It's a good way of starting if you're not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won't demand any immediate monetary commitment.

Now, as for its features, today, we'll be focusing on **Blender Rigging** features.

#### In this article

01 [Why Use Blender Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]](#Part 2)

03 [Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Use Blender Rigging?**

**Blender Character Rigging** is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it's capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.

So, if you want to create video projects for your audience's entertainment or edification with animation, then **Blender Rigging** is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished **Blender Rigging** animations.)

## Part 2 **The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]**

For this next section, we're going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about **Blender Character Rigging**, **Blender Facial Rigging**, **Blender Muscle Rig**, and so on.

These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we've linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it's something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‚ÄòBlender' experience.)

### 01**Blender Character Rigging**

The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, **Blender Character Rigging**. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy **Blender character rigging**, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.

### 02**Blender Facial Rigging**

Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about **Blender Facial Rigging** from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of **Blender Rigging** tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face's character to become animated.)
