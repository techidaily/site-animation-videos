## Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it

We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.

![voila ai artist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-make-3d-cartoon-of-yourself-01.jpg)

The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.

**●** Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone's Camera rolling permission.

**●** Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature & and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.

**●** Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a **celebrities** option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.

**●** Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D & Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.

If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free & watermark free animated representations.

## Part 2 How to Create a 3D Cartoon of Yourself for Meta

Facebook only recently rebranded themselves as Meta. This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.

Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.

Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.

The process behind creating a **3D cartoon of yourself** for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.

Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.

## Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo

Photoshop is no doubt one of the most influential digital assets that allow you to do virtually anything with your photos. Of course, this includes turning your photos into 3D cartoon.

There are advanced techniques and tools you can use to retouch your image to achieve an animated like look for your portraits.

Of course, you can find multiple Photoshop hacks online but the following guide can give you an easy to follow idea of how to go about creating your own 3D cartoon out of an image.

![create 3d cartoon photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-make-3d-cartoon-of-yourself-02.jpg)

Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;

**●** To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.

**●** You can then ‘liquify' these layers to form a mould for your image.

**●** Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.

**●** Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.

**●** You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.

## Part 4 Five 3D cartoon Disney-Fied yourself apps

With the increasing popularity of Smartphones, people these days are experiencing all new things with lots of excitement. And GIFs are always the most interesting content for them. When we talk about limited band width and fast loading time solutions then GIFs are the first options in front of our eyes. These files use to have small size so they can be transferred and downloaded with ease and at faster rate. If you are interested to know about various resizing concepts related to GIFs then the article below can be helpful for you.

## How to reduce GIF size?

The list includes the colour count inside, dimensions of images that you have used for development of GIFs and number of frames included inside one GIF folder. In case if it is an animated GIF then size may increase accordingly. Somehow, if you become able to optimize your Gifs then it is much easier to share them over internet.

The very first task for users is to bring your GIF video file onto Photoshop timeline. Sometimes, it is not essential to update whole series of your GIF animation to the library, the GIF can be simply trimmed at timeline panel. One needs to turn on loop option and then be active enough to allocate the right place to trim your video.

 **2\. Reduce dimensions of Output:**

Those who are working on Photoshop CC 2017 version will be able to develop GIFs by simply executing Explore As option from menu. To do this, they need to move to files and then from drop down menu select Export as. Soon a menu will open where you need to choose your output file format as GIF and adjust weight and height parameter to reduce physical dimensions of your image.

In case if you are using Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 then on its interface, users need to move to File and then hit Save for Web option. It will help to open a Save for Web type dialogue box immediately, on this new window you can apply desired changes to physical dimensions of your content, reduce color information and apply dithering etc.

One of the most useful tricks for marketers is to optimize size of their GIF images by adjusting total number of colours to it. It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.

 **Tips:**

During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.

## Part 2 **10 Best Text Motion After Effects**

Alright, now let's move on to our promised **Text Motion Graphics After Effects** and **Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro** templates. We've tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!

### 01[**Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal' by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you're confused, it's a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.

Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.

### 02[**Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title**](https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The next **text motion** template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title' also created by Mogrt. This one is **text motion graphics** that you can use for **Premiere Pro** and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It's a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!

As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as **text motion** for [after effects](https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt), it is available for that as well!

### 03[**Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro**](https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?%5Fga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text' graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we've provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that's just starting out and doesn't want anything too complicated.

### 04[**30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt**](https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?%5Fga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets' by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It's also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

### 05[**Comic Bubbles MOGRT**](https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?%5Fga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

### 06[**Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?%5Fga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal' is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the **text motion graphics** are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It's perfect for those looking for underwater-themed **text motion graphics**. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.

This is **Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro**. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.

### 07[**Text Messages Toolkit**](https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?%5Fga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit' might be a fun **text motion graphics** for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it's a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message' interactions. It's customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that's what you want.

### 08[**Large Text Title Block**](https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/)

With the ‘large text title block' template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you're wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!

### 09[**Blueprint Titles**](https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?%5Fga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want something that's a little quirkier? Or, perhaps, instructional? Then the ‘Blueprint Titles' template is one that you can consider. As you can perhaps guess from the name, it allows you to create **text motion graphics** in a style that is similar to the kind of blueprints you usually see when working with design or architecture.

### 10[**Dynamic Minimalism**](https://videohive.net/item/dynamic-minimalism-essential-graphics-mogrt/21637324?s%5Frank=16&%5Fga=2.111208772.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

## Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging

As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

**●** What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.

**●** Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.

The function of **character rigging** can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.

## Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging

As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.

## Part 2 8 Tips for Character Rigging

### 01The Right Rig for the Job

Rigging is a skill all animators gets good at overtime. The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.

You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don't. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.

### 02Deformers for Facial Rigging

Constructing a realistic facial rig can be quite a task but is indeed satisfying once finished. Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

Though you can use one without the other, it is best to use both of them in an animation. You can't work without both arms can you? Applying both Inverse and Forward Kinematics in your rig design can help it make more stylistic.

### 04Learn Python and Maya API: Learn Python and Maya API

If you wish to take your rigging skills to the next level then learning Maya API and Python are great millstones. This way, you can create high quality and sophisticated rigs with high intense flexibility on Maya. Also, Python allows you to write new scripts for PlugIns.

### 05Delegate to an Animator

After rigging for several hours it is easy to feel like you are only seeing from one perspective. Get in touch with an animator earlier on in the project can help you get feedback to stay consistent in the rigging process.

### 06Learn Web Technologies: Learn Web Technologies

To be a good animator or rigging specialist involves a lot of learning. Animation technology is constantly changing therefore it is highly recommended to stay up to date with the latest web technologies. Learning HTML, Java Script and CSS is becoming vital to being a part of the gaming world.

### 07Use Scalable Tools

Not all the characters or objects you rig are going to be of the same size. Selecting the right rigging software is crucial for you to be able to scale your animations. You won't need to use everything, just the tools that serve your purpose.

### 08Use a Clean Interface

If you have ever heard of the phrase 'clean workplace – cleaner work' then you should know how an untidy interface can affect your workflow. This won't necessarily change the results but can surely better your experience.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

**●** What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.

**●** Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.
