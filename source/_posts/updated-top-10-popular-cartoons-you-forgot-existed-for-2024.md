## Part 1 **Do You Remember the Very Popular Simpsons?**

The Simpsons is an American animated cartoonist Matt Groening created for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a "golden age."

The **popular cartoon** series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.

However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750\. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.

Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.

However, here are the ten best cartoon shows that have existed since the Simpsons:

### 01Futurama

This **popular cartoon** series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that's pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-3.jpg)

### 02The Critic

This cartoon series was first created in 1994 by the Simpson's writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss. This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor's non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz's Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-4.jpg)

### 03Bojack Horseman

Bojack Horseman is a **dumb cartoon character** series first created on August 22, 2014\. However, four (4) days later, the series was renewed for a second season, released on July 17, 2015\. It is often a searing portrait of addiction, failure, depression, etc., as humans talk to a horse.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-5.jpg)

### 04Family Guy

Family Guy, the **snoopy cartoon** series, was first created on January 31, 1999, which goes for anything for a laugh style. However, you might not like the Griffin family or the other residents of Quahog, but you have to admit that the show stumbles on a great joke.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-6.jpg)

### 05South Park

South Park debuted with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe, " first created on August 13, 1997\. Although it started with some cheap animations, it has become one of the iconic animated shows.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-7.jpg)

### 06Batman: The Animated Series

The Batman animated cartoon series, created on September 5, 1992, is a favorite for many people, although it is more comedy than an animated drama.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-8.jpg)

### 07Gravity Falls

This cartoon animated series was first created on June 15, 2012, and is a mystery story about a few kids with a supernatural bend.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 07](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-9.jpg)

### 08Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

This **popular cartoon** animated series was first created in 1983 by cartoonists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. This cartoon series is the definitive version, brightly colored and fun and fluffy.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 08](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-10.jpg)

### 09Doug

This cartoon animated series was first created on March 26, 1999, by Jim Jinkins and produced by Jumbo Pictures. It was one of the first animated shows on Nickelodeon before moving to Disney pictures. However, this show is creative and down-to-earth at the same time.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 09](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-11.jpg)

### 10Hey Arnold

This cartoon animated series came in on October 7, 1996\. This show was the second after the first wave of the Nickelodeon show. It was the best of the bunch, and I liked the evolved version of "Doug."

## Part 1 **Do You Remember the Very Popular Simpsons?**

The Simpsons is an American animated cartoonist Matt Groening created for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a "golden age."

The **popular cartoon** series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.

However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750\. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.

Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.

However, here are the ten best cartoon shows that have existed since the Simpsons:

### 01Futurama

This **popular cartoon** series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that's pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-3.jpg)

### 02The Critic

This cartoon series was first created in 1994 by the Simpson's writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss. This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor's non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz's Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.

### 03Bojack Horseman

Bojack Horseman is a **dumb cartoon character** series first created on August 22, 2014\. However, four (4) days later, the series was renewed for a second season, released on July 17, 2015\. It is often a searing portrait of addiction, failure, depression, etc., as humans talk to a horse.

### 04Family Guy

Family Guy, the **snoopy cartoon** series, was first created on January 31, 1999, which goes for anything for a laugh style. However, you might not like the Griffin family or the other residents of Quahog, but you have to admit that the show stumbles on a great joke.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-6.jpg)

### 05South Park

South Park debuted with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe, " first created on August 13, 1997\. Although it started with some cheap animations, it has become one of the iconic animated shows.

### 06Batman: The Animated Series

The Batman animated cartoon series, created on September 5, 1992, is a favorite for many people, although it is more comedy than an animated drama.

### 09Doug

This cartoon animated series was first created on March 26, 1999, by Jim Jinkins and produced by Jumbo Pictures. It was one of the first animated shows on Nickelodeon before moving to Disney pictures. However, this show is creative and down-to-earth at the same time.

### 10Hey Arnold
