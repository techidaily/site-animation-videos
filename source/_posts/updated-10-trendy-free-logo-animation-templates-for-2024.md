### 02How to Get the TikTok Anime Filter?

Now to finally get down to business How exactly can you get the **anime filter** for your TikTok?

### 03A step-by-step breakdown of this process has been provided below (pictures included)

##### Step 1Download the Snapchat App

Alright, to start off with, you'll need to download the Snapchat app on your smartphone (it's available for both Android and iOS devices)

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

### 0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character

**Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg)

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.

Works with most skin tones.

Better hair/accessory integration.

##### Cons

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

**Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-07.jpg)

Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called **Cartoon Style** This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo & Stitch, etc.), but it doesn't make it any less fun

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens.

Works with all skin tones.

Works with accessories.

##### Cons

More of a cartoon animated style than anime.

Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.

Not great at capturing motion.

Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes

**Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter**

![Anime Filter from TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-08.jpg)

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

Not the best with skin tones.

It doesn't use the classic Japanese-animation style.

This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before' and ‘after' (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.

**Anime Filter #4: Anime Eyes**

It was created by one of the users of Snapchat and can be found there if you want to use it This one doesn't animate the whole face of the user, but it does apply a sticker of various ‘anime eyes' that you can use as a semi-**animated profile picture maker** (free)

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat filter

Useful as an animated profile picture maker

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform.

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories

Works with most skin tones.

Better hair/accessory integration.

##### Cons

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

### 0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character

**Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg)

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.

Works with most skin tones.

Better hair/accessory integration.

##### Cons

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

**Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-07.jpg)

Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called **Cartoon Style** This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo & Stitch, etc.), but it doesn't make it any less fun

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens.

Works with all skin tones.

Works with accessories.

##### Cons

More of a cartoon animated style than anime.

**Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter**

![Anime Filter from TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-08.jpg)

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

Not the best with skin tones.

It doesn't use the classic Japanese-animation style.

## Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?

A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry. These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.

## Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations

3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.

### 01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients

Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his/her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.

### 02Training Of Medical Professionals

Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.

### 03Educating New Professionals

For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.

### 04Used As A Marketing Tool

Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.

### 05Marketing To Medical Professional

While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.

![3D Medical Animation Uses](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/all-about-3d-medical-animation-and-its-uses-02.jpg)

**●**Animations can be created to cater to a wider audience and people for different subjects.

## Part 4 Top 3D Animation Companies

## Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?

A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry. These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.

## Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations

3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.

### 01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients

Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his/her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.

### 02Training Of Medical Professionals

Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.

### 03Educating New Professionals

For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.

### 04Used As A Marketing Tool

Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.

### 05Marketing To Medical Professional

While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.

### 03Animated logos can convey more

A brand logo is supposed to be the identity of a brand. The logo should be capable enough of explaining your website’s understanding about the field. For instance, if your company is in the cyber security domain, the logo should be good enough to justify your company’s expertise. Animated logos help you establish trust by conveying more through the medium of a logo.

## Part 2 4 Awesome Ways to Use Logo Animation

### 01They can serve as introductions to marketing videos

Video marketing is one of the most commonly used marketing techniques. Research suggested that about 99 percent of brands use video marketing in order to enhance their brand image. Starting of your video with an animated logo will not just look catchy but also make the video all the more professional.

### 02They can make great outros

Just like animated videos can serve as amazing introductory bits of the video, they can also be the perfect outros to videos. If you haven’t added your animated logo in the introduction of the video then they can be added at the end. This will lead to your viewers remembering your brand for a longer time.

### 03Look very attractive at trade shows

Trade shows are opportunities where websites and company owners can interact with investors and potential customers face to face. It’s an excellent opportunity to make your mark on the big stage. Logos of companies may be projected on the big screen in such events. At such events when you have just a few seconds to make a mark, you need your logo to grab the viewer's attention. Hence, animated logos could be very useful.

### 04They could be a great addition to your company’s email signature

Emails are regarded as the 3rd largest information sources in the B2B industry. It is one of the largest means of communication and marketing. Email signatures have been around for years; however the traditional email signatures have now gone out of fashion. Contemporary email signatures include animated logos to leave a bigger impact on the receiver. Using animated logos, you can add grace to your email signatures and escape the ordinary.

## Part 3 6 of the Best Animated Logos

### 01Mastercard

Mastercard is one of the first companies to use animated logos. The logo is simply fantastic due to the meaning it conveys without any complex animation. The animated logo involves the traditional venn diagram logo of mastercard morphing into several objects. These objects include everything from food to groceries to luxurious products. It basically includes the various kinds of commodities people buy using mastercards.

### 02Burger king

Another popular brand that uses animated logos is the american fast food giant, burger king. The logo is not highly flashy like we see in mastercard. However, the animated logo does obviously look more attention seeking than the conventional static logo. The logo shows the stacking of the different elements of the logo one by one over each other. This resembles the process of making a burger.

### 03Fedex

Another logo that would classify as a flashy animated logo is the fedex logo. Initially, fedex had experimented with several logos before sticking to the arrow logo which continues even today. The animated logo involves an arrow making the letter “Fedex” with its trajectory and then finally settling in between letters X and E. The logistics giant delivers couriers from one corner of the world to another, and the arrow symbolizes exactly that!

### 04Flickr

Flickr is a popular stock image and video hosting platform. Anyone can use the stock images and videos in their content. The logo starts with a blue and pink dot initially. These dots later expand in a whirlpool like motion. The logo starts off with the static logo before it expands. The idea is to show that the online stock image portal goes beyond limits and has every picture and video you’d need

### 05Bundle

Bundle is a popular app that offers its users rewards upon shopping from selected stores. These stores have an alliance with bundle and upon shopping from them, users seek reward points on the bundle app. The animated logo starts of with a pink screen which later converges to become a large “B” wrapped with a gifting ribbon. Although, the logo is pretty simple it does an amazing job at explaining the brand’s MSP and attracts customers.

### 06Google

The logo of google has evolved over the years. Google is almost synonymous to attractive logos and it comes up with attractive new logos every now and then. One of the newest logos, an animated one, is by far one of the most attractive animated logos. It aims to depict the numerous things users can search using “Google voice search”.
