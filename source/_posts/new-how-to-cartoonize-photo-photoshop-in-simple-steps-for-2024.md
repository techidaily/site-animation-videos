Video marketing is one of the most commonly used marketing techniques. Research suggested that about 99 percent of brands use video marketing in order to enhance their brand image. Starting of your video with an animated logo will not just look catchy but also make the video all the more professional.

### 02They can make great outros

If you haven’t added your animated logo in the introduction of the video then they can be added at the end. This will lead to your viewers remembering your brand for a longer time.

### 03Look very attractive at trade shows

Trade shows are opportunities where websites and company owners can interact with investors and potential customers face to face. It’s an excellent opportunity to make your mark on the big stage. Logos of companies may be projected on the big screen in such events. At such events when you have just a few seconds to make a mark, you need your logo to grab the viewer's attention. Hence, animated logos could be very useful.

### 04They could be a great addition to your company’s email signature

Emails are regarded as the 3rd largest information sources in the B2B industry. It is one of the largest means of communication and marketing.
