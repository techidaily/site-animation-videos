### 02**PicMonkey**

When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend.

The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.
