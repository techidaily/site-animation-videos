![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.

## Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial

Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.

The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.

**Step 1:** The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.

**Step 2:**Look for the "Asset warp tool" present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.

![asset warp tool adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** Create the first joint using the "Asset warp tool" by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the "Asset warp tool" forms the first joint.

![create joint adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the "Warp Options" and choose the "Tools" tab. There you will see the option of "Create bones". Ensure to enable the "Create bones" option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.

![add more joints adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg)

**Step 5:** Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.

![Complete the rig formation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg)

The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.

The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.

**Step 6:** You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the "Asset warp tool".

![hold and drag joint adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg)

**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.

![hold and drag joint adobe animate 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg)

Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The "Edit Multiple Frames" mode helps you work with different keyframes.

You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.

![work with keyframes adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-7.jpg)
