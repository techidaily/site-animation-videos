## Part 1: Top 10 Banned Anime List

Here is a list of the 10 banned animes you should know about and why they are banned:

### 1\. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）

It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.

![shoujo-tsubaki](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-shoujo-tsubaki.jpg)

### 2\. Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)

Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series' first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show's first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.

![osomatsu-san](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-osomatsu-san.jpg)

### 3\. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)

Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it's too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.

![excel saga](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-excel-saga.jpg)

### 4\. Death Note (Banned in China)

Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.

![death-note](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-death-note.jpg)

### 5\. Attack on Titan (Banned in China)

Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!

![attack-on-titan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-attack-on-titan.jpg)

### 6\. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)

With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.

![high-school-dxd](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-high-school-dxd.jpg)

### 7\. Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)

Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni _Puny Poemy_ is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.

![puni-puny-poemy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-puni-puny-poemy.jpg)

### 8\. Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)

Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.

![hetalia-axis-powers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hetalia-axis-powers.jpg)

### 9\. Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)

Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps _THE_ most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?

![pokeman-banned-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-pokeman-banned-anime.jpg)

### 10\. Kite (Banned in Norway)

Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.

![kite-banned-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-kite-banned-anime.jpg)

## Part 1: Top 10 Banned Anime List

Here is a list of the 10 banned animes you should know about and why they are banned:

### 1\. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）

It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.

### 2\. Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)

Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series' first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show's first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.

![osomatsu-san](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-osomatsu-san.jpg)

### 3\. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)

Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it's too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.

### 4\. Death Note (Banned in China)

Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.

![death-note](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-death-note.jpg)

### 5\. Attack on Titan (Banned in China)

Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!

![attack-on-titan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-attack-on-titan.jpg)

### 6\. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)

With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.

![high-school-dxd](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-high-school-dxd.jpg)

### 7\. Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)

Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni _Puny Poemy_ is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.

![puni-puny-poemy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-puni-puny-poemy.jpg)

### 8\. Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)

Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.

![hetalia-axis-powers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hetalia-axis-powers.jpg)

### 9\. Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)

Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps _THE_ most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?

![pokeman-banned-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-pokeman-banned-anime.jpg)

### 10\. Kite (Banned in Norway)

Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.

With present-day technology, **3D animation** has reached all spheres be it entertainment, advertising, architecture, education, and much more. With the increasing use of 3D animation, there is a rise in the tools and programs used for creating such animations.

So, to help you get all the details about 3D animation, **3D modelling and animation process**, best tools, tips, and tricks, keep reading the following parts.

03 [Types of 3D Animations](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 3D Animation Software](#Part 4)

05 [Top Animation Tips and Tricks](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?

In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating **animation 3D models**.

The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.

![3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/a-beginners-guide-to-explain-what-3d-animation-is-02.jpg)

## Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?

Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.

### 01Modeling

The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.

### 02Layout and animation

The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.

### 03Rendering

The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.

After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.

![Process Of 3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/a-beginners-guide-to-explain-what-3d-animation-is-03.jpg)

05 [Top Animation Tips and Tricks](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?

In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating **animation 3D models**.

The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.

## Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?

Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.

### 01Modeling

The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.

### 02Layout and animation

The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.

### 03Rendering

The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.

After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn't be easier. A lot of the 'whiteboard animation' generators also work as **blackboard animation** generators.

In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.

02 [How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?**

**Blackboard animation** some may say is as outdated as the concept of 'blackboards' themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.

However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, **chalkboard animation** is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it's just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you're looking for — especially if you're looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)

![Traditional Blackboard with Chalk](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation1.png)

## Part 2 **How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?**

But alright, so how do you make it so that your **blackboard animation** is just as suited for the modern generation as it is for the older generation?? Well, that's easy really. You'll need images Or, rather, you'll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with **chalkboard animation**.

With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your **chalkboard animation video** and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.

![Black Blackboard and Drawing Pencils](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation2.png)

## Part 3 **How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?**

Alright, so onto actually talking about how you can go about creating a **chalkboard animation video** Take note, this is going to be an 'overview' kind of tutorial. We've also decided to choose a more 'custom' method, rather than using one of the premium **blackboard animation** generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)

### 01Step 1\. Pick Your Software

The first step in creating **chalkboard animation** is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more 'animation-specific', like After Effects. Or something more 'video-editing-specific' like Filmora.

Again, because this is meant to be more of a 'general' tutorial, we won't be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your **blackboard animation** videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project

![Filmora - Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation3.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Create a Storyboard**

Next, to make the actual **blackboard animation** creation process go smoother, it's important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create

The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don't necessarily have to draw every single frame of your **chalkboard animation** beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won't have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future

![Blackboard Animation - Storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation4.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Draw Characters**

For this step, we say 'characters' and use the word 'draw.' But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you'll need for each scene (if not each frame)

If you're not the 'drawing' type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you're really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind

![Prepare Characters for Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation5.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Put Together Project**

Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That's also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go

In the image below, we're only showing the start of a potential project. We've only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video

![Use Software to Create Blackboard Animation Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation6.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes **blackboard animation** videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you're doing it to promote your services/goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another

**●** Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn't make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals

**●** In our brief 'overview' tutorial, we expand on the subject of **blackboard animation** some more. Be warned, it's not the kind of project you should go into if you're not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.

**●** Still, there's something satisfying about a well-done **chalkboard animation video** that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.

Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn't be easier. A lot of the 'whiteboard animation' generators also work as **blackboard animation** generators.

In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.

## Part 1 **Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?**

**Blackboard animation** some may say is as outdated as the concept of 'blackboards' themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.

However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, **chalkboard animation** is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it's just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you're looking for — especially if you're looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)

## Part 2 **How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?**

But alright, so how do you make it so that your **blackboard animation** is just as suited for the modern generation as it is for the older generation?? Well, that's easy really. You'll need images Or, rather, you'll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with **chalkboard animation**.

With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your **chalkboard animation video** and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.

## Part 3 **How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?**

Alright, so onto actually talking about how you can go about creating a **chalkboard animation video** Take note, this is going to be an 'overview' kind of tutorial. We've also decided to choose a more 'custom' method, rather than using one of the premium **blackboard animation** generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)

### 01Step 1\. Pick Your Software

The first step in creating **chalkboard animation** is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more 'animation-specific', like After Effects. Or something more 'video-editing-specific' like Filmora.

Again, because this is meant to be more of a 'general' tutorial, we won't be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your **blackboard animation** videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project

### 02**Step 2\. Create a Storyboard**

Next, to make the actual **blackboard animation** creation process go smoother, it's important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create

The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don't necessarily have to draw every single frame of your **chalkboard animation** beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won't have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future

![Blackboard Animation - Storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation4.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Draw Characters**

For this step, we say 'characters' and use the word 'draw.' But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you'll need for each scene (if not each frame)

If you're not the 'drawing' type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you're really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind

### 04**Step 4\. Put Together Project**

Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That's also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go

In the image below, we're only showing the start of a potential project. We've only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video
