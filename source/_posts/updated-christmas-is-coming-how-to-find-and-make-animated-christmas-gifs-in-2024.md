## Part 1  5 Best Places to Find Animated Christmas GIFs for Free

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

![pinterest christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-2.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

If you are looking for funny Christmas GIFs, then Giphy would be one of the best places to explore. It has some of the most extensive GIFs collections of all styles, including Christmas wishes GIFs.

Tenor is another clean and user-friendly website where you can find different types of funny Merry Christmas GIFs for free. You can look for stickers and GIFs by simply entering keywords of your choice on Tenor.

## Part 2 How to Create your Animated Christmas GIFs (with Music): A DIY Guide

Most of these readily available animated Christmas GIFs are quite generic and lack a customized appeal. Therefore, if you want to come up with some customized Christmas wishes GIFs, then consider using a dedicated editing tool like Wondershare Filmora.

You can explore and use the wide range of media assets of Filmora or import anything from your system. Besides that, tons of transitions, filters, captions, and other effects would let you come up with some customized Merry Christmas wishes GIFs via Filmora in the following way.

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

## Part 2 History of Claymation Movies

### 01The Beginning of Claymation Movies

Well, you will be surprised to know that the Claymation videos came into existence after the introduction of plasticine. It was founded in 189and since then, clamaytion videos have been able to find their way to silver screens. In earlier times, people used to dip their toes into color and then try to create artwork. But with innovation, the process has been changed and the oldest known extant clay animation film is **Long Live the Bull (1926)** by Joseph Sunn. The main procedure for creating this film is Claymation.

![history of claymation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/ways-you-can-master-to-make-claymation-videos-3.jpg)

In the 190as well, there were some productions going on considering the claymation work, and some turned out to be successful, while some had no existence after that. For example, "Animated Putty" (1911), a historic feature by Walter R. Booth, dates back. So, yes, one can consider that this has existed for a very long time.

This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of **animate rigging**

To help them out (as well as other **animation rigging** beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!

#### In this article

01 [The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Animate Rigging?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation**

Before anything else, we’ve prepared a bit of an OVERVIEW on rigging in animation. This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.

### 01**What is Rigging in Animation**

Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.

Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) in order to get this done!

![AutoDesk Maya Software Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging1.jpg)

### 02**An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging**

2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!

### 03**An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging**

3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.

In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.

### 04**Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving**

Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:

**Joints|Bones**: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.

**Driven Keys**: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).

**Blend Shapes**: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.

**Inverse Kinematics**: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.

**Forward Kinematics**: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.

**Control Curves**: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.

**Constraint**: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.

**Deformers**: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.

**Skinning**: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.

**Weight Planning**: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.

**Facial Rigging**: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.

## Part 2 **How Do You Animate Rigging?**

Now, onto actually talking about how you can start **animate rigging**. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.

### 01**How to Rig a Simple Character**

This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:

**Step 1: Design Your Character**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg)

Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of **animation rigging** you’ll need to work on for that character.

For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!

So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.

**Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg)

When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!

Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.

**Step 3: Connect The Layers!**

It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.

**Step 4: Timing Your Animation**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging4.jpg)

With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions

### 02**Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging**

This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:

Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!

Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.

If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.

![AutoDesk Maya Software Shape Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging5.jpg)

### 03**How Auto Rig Mapping Works**

Auto-rigging is the use of pre-made rigs in order to simplify the process. The tool automatically maps the areas where the characters and the rig are given the same symbol names and snaps them together to create joints for a motion to be applied.

### 04**How Visual Rig Mapping Works**

Visual mapping is a lot more complicated the auto-rig mapping, so it’s not something you want to jump into immediately. However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:

Manually make connections starting with the joints.

Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.

Motion can then be added to the timeline.

### 05**Finalizing Your Animated Rig**

To finish us off, let’s talk about how you go about publishing your finished product! Of course, even after you have your complex rig completed, there are still other matters to think about in terms of making sure that the video is of quality!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Start off on the right footing by learning the basics of animation! These days, there are more options than ever, with the modern 3D animation rigging style now just as popular as the more classic 2D animation style.

**●** The best way to learn animation rigging is to practice! Structured guides can help you get to the point of almost mastery, but it’s not until you start playing with the tools of your craft that you can truly learn how to create beautiful animations!

**●** Some of the more complex functions of rigging require a lot of patience, so make sure that you always go into your projects with a level-head.

This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of **animate rigging**

To help them out (as well as other **animation rigging** beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!

#### In this article

01 [The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Animate Rigging?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation**

Before anything else, we’ve prepared a bit of an OVERVIEW on rigging in animation. This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.

### 01**What is Rigging in Animation**

Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.

Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) in order to get this done!

![AutoDesk Maya Software Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging1.jpg)

### 02**An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging**

2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!

### 03**An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging**

3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.

In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.

### 04**Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving**

Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:

**Joints|Bones**: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.

**Driven Keys**: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).

**Blend Shapes**: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.

**Inverse Kinematics**: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.

**Forward Kinematics**: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.

**Control Curves**: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.

**Constraint**: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.

**Deformers**: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.

**Skinning**: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.

**Weight Planning**: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.

**Facial Rigging**: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.

## Part 2 **How Do You Animate Rigging?**

Now, onto actually talking about how you can start **animate rigging**. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.

### 01**How to Rig a Simple Character**

This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:

**Step 1: Design Your Character**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg)

Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of **animation rigging** you’ll need to work on for that character.

For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!

So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.

**Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg)

When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!

Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.

**Step 3: Connect The Layers!**

It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.

**Step 4: Timing Your Animation**

This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

![Xara 3D Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator7.png)

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

![TISFAT](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator10.png)

## Part 2 **8 Best Online Text GIF Generators to Make Animated Word GIFs**

And so, we move on to our next list! Here's where we introduce online solutions for animated text generation needs! So, all the tools on this list will not require any downloading, but they will require that you have internet while working!

### 01MotionDen

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

**RATING:** 4.5/5

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

![Wave.Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator12.png)

### 03MakerMoon

| PROS                                                                                                                                                       | CONS                                                                                                                                                     |

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

![MakerMoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator13.png)

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

![Textanim](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator14.png)

### 05SnackThis

| PROS                                                                                                                                             | CONS                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

### 06Animatron Studio

| PROS                                                                                                                    | CONS                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

![Animatron Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator16.png)

### 07Cool Text

| PROS                                                                        | CONS                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

![Cool Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator17.png)

### 08Loading.io

| PROS                                                                                                                                   | CONS                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

## Part 2 **8 Best Online Text GIF Generators to Make Animated Word GIFs**

And so, we move on to our next list! Here's where we introduce online solutions for animated text generation needs! So, all the tools on this list will not require any downloading, but they will require that you have internet while working!

### 01MotionDen

| PROS                                                                           | CONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

**RATING:** 4.5/5

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

![MakerMoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator13.png)

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

### 05SnackThis

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

### 06Animatron Studio

| PROS                                                                                                                    | CONS                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

![Animatron Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator16.png)

### 07Cool Text

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

![Cool Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator17.png)

### 08Loading.io

| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

![Aurora 3D Maker: Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator1.png)

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

![Xara 3D Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator7.png)

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |

| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

![Aurora 3D Maker: Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator1.png)

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.
