For example, you can speed up the animation with the 'Speed' slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the 'Repeat' slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result

****Step 5: Download as GIF**

To wrap things up, it's time to download your finished animation Loading.IO gives several options for this. But, of course, in our case, we choose to 'Download As: GIF'

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)

****Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack**

First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop 'Image Stack'. This can be done by clicking the 'File' tab and selecting the 'Scripts > Load Files into Stack…' option

Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click 'OK' when done

If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the 'File' tab and clicking on the 'Import > Video Frames to Layers…' option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2

Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.

Flipbook can be a good example of the mechanism behind 2D Animation. After drawing a character or an object on the first page of a notebook, continue drawing for the next page and so on. Each removing should be a bit ahead or behind. When flipped swiftly, the series of drawings makes the character or object move.

The working of 2D Animation is not so different. But the detailing of the subject or the object cannot be minimal as a flipbook. 2D Animation demands more characters and more details while at the same time requiring smooth, visually appealing, and accurate detailing, which is a lot of pressure for the makers. Thanks to 2D making software, a week's work can be taken care of in minutes or two.

### 02Working on 3D Animation

Exporting the animated movie is the last step in creating an animation. How to make an animation is no more a big reason for headache. If you want, you may also share it directly on the social media platforms with your friends and viewers.

## Conclusion

Now, as you know how to make an animation and the steps involved in it, you must also be aware of one of the best software for editing.

Here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use it to make animation video by adding keyframes, so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation. Besides, color correction and audio mixer will raise up your animation video to a new level. Download it to have a try (Free)!

## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

![Aurora 3D Maker: Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator1.png)

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

![Xara 3D Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator7.png)

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

![TISFAT](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator10.png)

## Part 2 **8 Best Online Text GIF Generators to Make Animated Word GIFs**

And so, we move on to our next list! Here's where we introduce online solutions for animated text generation needs! So, all the tools on this list will not require any downloading, but they will require that you have internet while working!

### 01MotionDen

| PROS                                                                           | CONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

![MotionDen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator11.png)

**RATING:** 4.5/5

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

![Wave.Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator12.png)

### 03MakerMoon

| PROS                                                                                                                                                       | CONS                                                                                                                                                     |

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

![MakerMoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator13.png)

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

![Textanim](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator14.png)

### 05SnackThis

| PROS                                                                                                                                             | CONS                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

![SnackThis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator15.png)

### 06Animatron Studio

| PROS                                                                                                                    | CONS                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

![Animatron Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator16.png)

### 07Cool Text

| PROS                                                                        | CONS                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

![Cool Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator17.png)

### 08Loading.io

| PROS                                                                                                                                   | CONS                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

![Loading.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator18.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

## Part 2 **8 Best Online Text GIF Generators to Make Animated Word GIFs**

And so, we move on to our next list! Here's where we introduce online solutions for animated text generation needs! So, all the tools on this list will not require any downloading, but they will require that you have internet while working!

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

**RATING:** 4.5/5

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

![MakerMoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator13.png)

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

### 05SnackThis

| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

![Animatron Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator16.png)

### 07Cool Text

| PROS                                                                        | CONS                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

![Cool Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator17.png)

| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well).

### 08Easy Banner

**RATING:** 3.5/5

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |

| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

![Aurora 3D Maker: Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator1.png)

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking.

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

From our very childhood, we have come across numerous cartoons shows. But have we ever wondered how the skeleton of these cartoon characters would look? No worries if you have not given a thought to this. This article can give you a small tour of the world where you will be able to see skeletons of a few famous cartoon characters that we have known since our childhood. The skeletons of famous cartoon characters are:

### 01Charlie

Charlie Brown, known as Charlie, is the main character in the comic strip Peanuts. This is a widely recognized American cartoon. Many people can relate to Charlie. Charlie is shy, nervous, and lacks confidence. These characteristics make him relatable to a chunk of common people. Charlie is referred to as the "Loveable Loser."Charlie is an overwhelmingly short and stout character physically. Have you ever imagined how Charlie's skeleton version would look? Here is how the **skeleton cartoon** of Charlie would look.

### 02Fred Flintstone

I have known very few people who do not know about Fred Flintstone. Fred Flinstone is the protagonist of the famous American sitcom show Yabba-Dabba-Dinosaurs and the entire franchise. The Flinstone is another show that features Fred with his family. Of course, the show's main attraction is the Flinstone family and the way this show is set. This show is set in a way that romanticizes a family living in a cave. Coming to talk about skeletons, have you ever thought that what if a **skeleton cartoon show** version of The Flintstone were made. How would this short, fat man with almost a square look as a skeleton? We can look up here how the skeleton version of Fred Flintstone looks:

### 03Bubbles

The Bubble is one of the main characters of the popular TV cartoon show Powerpuff girls. The other protagonists are Blossom and Buttercup, her sisters. The Bubble is named Bubble because she is the bubbliest and most fun-loving among the three sisters. Bubble is a sweet little girl with a round face and big round eyes and short limbs. These characteristics in this character make it look cuter. But to think, how would we imagine Bubble in a skeleton version. This is how Bubble would look like a skeleton.

### 04Dexter

Dexter is the protagonist in the show Dexter's Laboratory. Dexter is one of the most outstanding kid scientists who have made great inventions in his secret laboratory. It would be more appropriate to call Dexter an anti-heroic protagonist. He works in his secret laboratory for various projects like stopping bullying worldwide. Dexter is a short young boy with curly hair. Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious. But this is how Dexter would look like a **skeleton cartoon.**

### 05Pikachu

Pikachu is one of the characters or one of the Pokémons in the famous animated Japanese series Pokémon. Pikachu is a small yellow furry Pokémon. It seems very sweet to the audience and the general public, but it acquires a dangerous skill to give out an electric shock. This small yellow furry creature has featured in many films with the protagonist of the famous show Pokémon Ash Ketchum. This cartoon character has a presence in the fashion industry. It has been used to fashion dresses, bags, and many more. How would it be if we sat to think of a skeleton version of this furry creature? This may not a pleasant experience for everyone. The perfect way to demonstrate pikachu as a skeleton version would be:

## Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Skeletons With Step by Step

Have you ever tried drawing **a skeleton cartoon character**? You can use a **skeleton cartoon** to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw **skeleton cartoon**. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:

**Step 1:** To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let's start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.

**Step 2:** The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.

![start with head skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.

**Step 4:** To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body's center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.

**Step 5:** After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.

![draw ribs skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-7.jpg)

**Step 6:** After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.

**Step 7:** The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.

**Step 8:** Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.

**Step 9:** Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

**Step 11:** After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.

**Step 12:** To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.

**Step 13:** Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.

**Step 14:** After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.

![draw upper half of the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-9.jpg)

**Step 15:** Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.

**Step 16:** After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.

**Step 17:** Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.

**Step 18:** Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.

![add feet skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-10.jpg)

**Step 19:** You can color your skeleton drawing or give your shading style after your skeleton drawing is done.

You can make quirky **skeleton cartoon** animations and compile them to a video, adding music effects. You might think you need different apps for the video and the audio editing part. That might be the case for other apps. Here is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**; you can edit your video, make slideshows, and edit the background sound score.

I have known very few people who do not know about Fred Flintstone. Fred Flinstone is the protagonist of the famous American sitcom show Yabba-Dabba-Dinosaurs and the entire franchise. The Flinstone is another show that features Fred with his family. Of course, the show's main attraction is the Flinstone family and the way this show is set.

Dexter is a short young boy with curly hair. Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious. But this is how Dexter would look like a **skeleton cartoon.**

## Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Skeletons With Step by Step

Have you ever tried drawing **a skeleton cartoon character**? You can use a **skeleton cartoon** to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw **skeleton cartoon**. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:

**Step 1:** To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let's start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.

**Step 2:** The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.

![start with head skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.

**Step 4:** To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body's center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.

**Step 5:** After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.

![draw ribs skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-7.jpg)

**Step 6:** After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.

**Step 7:** The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.

**Step 8:** Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.

**Step 9:** Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

**Step 11:** After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.

**Step 12:** To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.

**Step 13:** Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.

**Step 14:** After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.

![draw upper half of the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-9.jpg)

**Step 15:** Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.

**Step 16:** After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.

**Step 17:** Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.

![add feet skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-10.jpg)
