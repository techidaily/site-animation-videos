![How to Animate Pictures in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-2.jpg)

#### Step 1: Add Static Elements

Start by creating an image through static elements. To make the design attractive, you can add sample texts, illustrations, doodles, and other entities.

Try to stimulate your creativity and come up with a layout beforehand. If possible, sketch on paper and replicate the same.

#### Step 2: Animate Your Design

Take a final glance at the layout. Make sure it's perfect. Once all the elements are placed as per your design, it's time to animate them. For that:

* Click on the white background page
* Go to the "Toolbar" section
* Select the "Animate" button

#### Step 3: Select Page Animation Style

Canva offers six animation styles, where five are for free users, and one is for pro users. To access the five animation styles, follow these steps.

* Press the "Animate" Button
* Select "Page Animations"
* There you will find options like Block, Pan, Fade, Rise, and Tumble
* Select the style as per your design

#### Step 4: Preview and Download

After selecting a page animation style, it will preview the effect. If you find it good, move on to downloading the GIF. Here's how to do so

* Go to the "Toolbar" option (present on your upper right hand)
* Choose GIF as the file type
* Check the page number and verify if it's correct
* Press the "Done" button

#### Step 5: Final GIF

After clicking on the "Done" button, your GIF will be downloaded. You will be able to see a display for five seconds. If you want to edit the image after this, click on the time button (near the "Animate" button).

So, that was all about how to animate a photo in Canva.

### **Drawbacks of Canva**

Despite efficient features and easy interface, there are certain areas where Canva lacks. This includes

* It does not have any local file storage.
* As too many people use Canva, your template may look the same as others.
* Some of its best features are not free to access.
* The mobile app version lacks certain elements and features.

Out of all these drawbacks, repetitions of templates are a big issue. That's because everyone wants their posts to look unique and irreplaceable. However, common Canva templates may prevent that from happening.

Fortunately, there are ways to combat such issues. Let's learn about them in the next section.
