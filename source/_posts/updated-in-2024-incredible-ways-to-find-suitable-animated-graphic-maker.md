Often, conveying information about your brands, services, and products becomes uninteresting for the audience. To make it more appealing, animated graphics can do the perfect job. They are fascinating to watch and deliver all the required information in a new and novel way. This does not bore the audience. Instead, if the animations are unique and exciting, people can actually be interested in watching them at will.

### 03 Customize it based on your needs

Graphic animations can be created based on the requirements of your marketing. And it is not just about the needs; it can be based on the audience genre you have. For example, if your products or services are meant for the kids, the animation will be made according to those factors that appeal to the kids. If your brand is for senior citizens, the animations will be different. Most importantly, if your brand shifts its audience genre, animations can also be created in the genre that you are choosing to serve at present. Thus, the customization ability of graphics animation offers flexibility in marketing.

Now, when it comes to video marketing, the majority of businesses prefer choosing 2D animations. The reason being 2D animations have a lower production cost and they still offer complete liberty over creativity. However, it's worth noting that editing a visually engaging 2D animation requires expertise.

That's why it's always an ideal solution to hire a dedicated **2D animation company**. Such organizations have experienced video editors who specialize in 2D video editing and can craft the perfect 2D animation for your brand. In this article, we are going to walk you through a list of the top 12 **2D animation studios** you can hire to launch an enticing marketing video for your business.

#### In this article

## Part 1 What is a 2D Animation Video and How Much Does a 2D Animation Video Cost?

First things first; what is a 2D animation and why is it necessary to hire a **2D animation company**? In layman's terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can't be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).

Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it's always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.

The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000\. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it's also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You'll have to be extra cautious while picking through the **best 2D animation studios**.

## Part 2 How Much Time Does It Take to Create a 2D Animation Video?

Due to their immense popularity in the marketing world, many business owners and marketers want to know how much time it takes to create a 2D animation video. Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated **2D animation company**, you'll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don't know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.

## Part 3 What Are the Best Company for Creating 2D Animation Video?

Now that you know the cost and time it takes to create a 2D animation video, let's dive into the list of the most popular **2D animation studios** you can hire for the next project.
