03 [8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?

To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.

Let's say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.

## Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio

So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let's understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It's worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams.

When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you'll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don't have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.

Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your **OBS animated lower-third** graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you'll end up losing potential viewers.

Here's a YouTube video that'll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.

02 [How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio](#Part 2)

03 [8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?

To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.

Let's say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.

## Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio

So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let's understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It's worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an **animated lower third in OBS** studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.

When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you'll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don't have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.

Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your **OBS animated lower-third** graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you'll end up losing potential viewers.

Here's a YouTube video that'll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.

Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.

Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Now, you have to uncheck the **Loop** **Time** tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.

### Frequently Asked Questions About Converting Video to GIFs

#### 1\. How To Crop A GIF To A Circle?

Whether or not you can crop a GIF into a circle, depends on the cropping tools the app you are using offers. Some GIF makers allow you to choose the shape to which you are going to crop a GIF, while others don’t provide this option.

Using [Filmora’s mask features](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably one of the easiest ways to crop a GIF to a circle, as you simply have to apply the mask to the footage and specify which parts of the GIF’s frames are going to be removed. What’s more, you can choose the shape of the mask in Filmora which enables you to crop GIFs into a variety of different shapes.

#### 2\. How To Turn A Video Into A GIF?

All you need to do in order to turn a video into a GIF is to change the file’s format. Most videos are saved as MP4, AVI, or MOV files, and nearly all video editors and GIF makers allow you to convert a video file into a GIF.

So, you simply have to choose GIF as the format in which you want to export a video file you imported into a video editing software or an online GIF maker and wait for the rendering process to be completed.
