### 2\. Draw your animated character

Since you're trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.

![create animation pencil2d 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-8.jpg)

### 4.Repeat until you get an animation

Now that you know how to deal with multiple frames, you can continue creating frames and making the animated characters move by tweaking with the drawing in every frame. For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you've your desired animated video.

## Part 1 What are Animated Pictures?

For readers who aren't familiar with animated images, here's what you need to know. An animated image (also referred to as GIF) is designed by adding motion to a still image. Remember all the funny cat memes you see on Instagram? Well, they are a great example of animated images.

However, it's important to understand that the applications of animated images aren't only limited to social media and marketing. You can even animate your family photos and add life to those 20-year old pictures you've been saving forever. Not to mention, you can also create animated images of your favorite superhero movie. Love the Justice League starcast? Simply pick your favorite superhero and you'll get stunning **Justice League animated** images.

## Part 2 Is It Possible to Animate Pictures On Your Own?

When it comes to animating images, the majority of users want to know if it's at all possible to create animated images by themselves. Even though animating an image is a tedious task, it's safe to say that you can do it without any external help.

Of course, if you choose a tool like Adobe Photoshop to do the job, you'll be out of luck because of the steep learning curve. But, there are hundreds of other alternatives you can use to **animate pictures**. There are ready-to-use **3D photo animators online** that'll allow you to animate any image within a few seconds. These tools are equipped with pre-installed animation templates that you can apply to any image and bring life to them.
