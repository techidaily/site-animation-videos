## Part 1 Let's Figure out What's Anime Filter First

### 01What is the Anime Filter on TikTok?

Okay, first off What even is this **anime filter** everyone is talking about and how can you use it to **turn yourself into an animated character**? We've attached a helpful YouTube Video below from @Kapwing who has a more comprehensive explanation for you.

But, as for the basics? It works just like most filters in that it can be used in both video and picture mode (allowing you to also **make your own animated profile picture** if you'd like). All you have to do is turn it on, and it'll turn you into the most fitting anime character of your style immediately

### 02How to Get the TikTok Anime Filter?

Now to finally get down to business How exactly can you get the **anime filter** for your TikTok? Well, here's the trick Despite having earned its popularity on TikTok, the **Anime Style** filter actually comes from Snapchat So, if you do want to animate yourself like you've seen all the other popular TikTok-ers do, you'll need to record the video (or take the picture) on the Snapchat App first and then upload it to TikTok.

### 03A step-by-step breakdown of this process has been provided below (pictures included)

##### Step 1Download the Snapchat App

Alright, to start off with, you'll need to download the Snapchat app on your smartphone (it's available for both Android and iOS devices)

![Download the Snapchat App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-01.jpg)

##### Step 2Open Snapchat App on your mobile device

##### Step 3Search for the Anime Style Filter on Snapchat

Once you have the Snapchat app open, click on the search bar at the top of the interface, type ‘anime style', and search

You might find that there are multiple versions of the filter (like as is shown in the image below), but the one that you need to select is the one titled Anime Style and created by Snapchat (it should appear first, as it does in the example)

![Look for the Anime Style filter on Snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-03.jpg)

##### Step 4Turn Yourself into an Animated Character

Finally You should be moved to the video recorder or the profile picture taker, where you can see yourself animated once and for all

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

### 0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character

**Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg)

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.

Works with most skin tones.

Better hair/accessory integration.

##### Cons

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

**Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-07.jpg)

Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called **Cartoon Style** This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo & Stitch, etc.), but it doesn't make it any less fun

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens.

Works with all skin tones.

Works with accessories.

##### Cons

More of a cartoon animated style than anime.

Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.

Not great at capturing motion.

Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes

**Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter**

![Anime Filter from TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-08.jpg)

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

Not the best with skin tones.

It doesn't use the classic Japanese-animation style.

The first step, of course, is to go to the app store on your mobile device.

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

### 02How to Get the TikTok Anime Filter?

### 03A step-by-step breakdown of this process has been provided below (pictures included)

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks.

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

Not the best with skin tones.

It doesn't use the classic Japanese-animation style.

This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before' and ‘after' (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

### Frequently Asked Questions About GIF Apps on Android

#### 1\. Is It Possible To Create Gifs From An Android Device?

Recording a GIF with a camera on an Android phone is not possible unless you install a third-party app. There a lot of GIF apps for Android to choose from that enable you to create GIFs directly from your phone.

GIF Camera, GIF Maker or GIF Creator are just a few among countless apps that allow Android users to make GIFs, although some of them place limits on the maximum duration of a GIF. In addition, most of these apps are equipped with filters and effects that can be easily applied to a GIF.

#### 2\. How To Add Text To A GIF From An Android Phone?

In case the app you are using to record a GIF with an Android phone doesn’t offer text tools you will have to use a video editing app to add text to a GIF you created. However, most GIF apps are equipped with at least basic text editing tools that enable you to apply text layers over the animated GIFs you create with them.

After you launch a GIF app and record a new GIF, you can use the text tool to insert the text you want to include in a GIF and to adjust its position, size, or color.

#### 3\. Why Can’t I Preview Gifs On My Android Phone?

Android OS has had compatibility issues with GIF files for years, as nearly all versions of the OS don’t offer native support for GIFs. In case you are having trouble previewing a GIF file from an Android device, you should try restarting it in order to make sure that some unrelated issue isn’t causing the lagging.

If the issue persists, you should update the OS to Android 7.1 or later, because previous versions of the OS may experience difficulties displaying GIF files.

#### 1\. Adobe Animate Camera

Adobe Animate CC introduces virtual camera functionality unlike other [animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With the help of this feature, you can easily stimulate your camera’s movement giving your animation a more realistic view.

Making it simpler, you can effortlessly execute panning, zooming and rotating to your animations if you wish. Using the virtual camera in Animate CC, you will be enabling to add more dramatic effects while creating an animation.

For instance, if there’s a fighting scene in our animated movie, you can rotate at the moment the scene shows destruction to give it a dramatic effect or you can zoom in or out and change the viewer’s attention from one point to the other.

#### 2\. Export format

Adobe Animate CC has adapted the web standards for the exporting your animation which makes it easier for everyone to view it from desktop to mobile device.

This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.

Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.

Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.

#### 3\. Vector brushes

Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.

This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.

#### 4\. Audio Syncing

The timeline feature of the tool will now allow the users to sync audios in their animations and this is a yet another feature that Animate CC has added. This means you can do audio synchronization for your animation series.

![animate cc audio syncing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-audio-syncing.JPG)

Nevertheless, doing this can be a little demanding as well as time-consuming with HTML5 alone. In addition, you also get enabled for audio loop control with the Adobe Animate CC’s timeline feature.

#### 5\. Font

Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts. These web fonts will be present for HTML5 canvas documents in the tool. Users can pick out from thousands of high-quality fonts via a subscription plan.

Putting in different words, first you can try some selected fonts available in the Typekit library via any level of Creative Cloud plan. Then when you subscribe by spending some money, you can then get access to complete Typekit library where there are thousands of premium fonts for HTML5 canvas.

## Final Verdict

Animation industry is no doubt a very interesting one and having the best tool can make it more interesting and fun. After making you familiarize with the top functionalities that are coming with Adobe Animate CC, we feel it would be fair to end the discussion here. Hope you will not give a second thought on Animate CC when need to do flash animation.

Before ending, one more thing that we would like to give the other thought by introducing you Filmora.

No, this is a not another feature, but an interesting yet powerful video editing software created by Wondershare, one of the leading brand in multimedia field. You can use this tool and get your animated videos edited using its extraordinary effects.
