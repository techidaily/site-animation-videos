You may have heard of Anime. **What is Anime?** Anime, Manga, and Cartoons all are the exquisite openings of little portals into the other worlds that will entertain, delight, and educate you at the same time. They are the forms of art and words creating a unique medium for sharing the realities of the world, spirituality, and ideas.

The digital world has grown so immensely, and then Amine, Manga, and Cartoon have become popular in the whole world that people often confuse these terms. To understand them better and to decode the myth of anime, manga, and cartoon, we’ll go deeper into each and see what anime is, and show the differences in anime, manga, and cartoon.

* [**Part 1:** **What is Anime?**](#part1)
* [**Part 2:** **What is Manga?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3:** **What is Cartoon?**](#part3)
* [**Part 4:** **Differences between Anime, Manga, and Cartoon**](#part4)

## **Part 1: What is Anime?**

Anime is the Japanese form of animation – word for word. This scrupulous style and form of animation originated in Japan characterized by its vivid imagination and bright color usage. The thematic elements of fantasy and fiction combined with science give this style its unique look and feel. This meticulously thought and designed animation is nowadays produced all around the world intending its huge fanbase not just in the Japanese but all over the world.

The story is behind the word anime is interesting – the Japanese animēshiyon is a loanword from English animation, which then made its journey back to English as anime. So, the Japanese borrowed it from English and the English took it back modified. This modified version of animation became the basis of many popular TV shows and movies that excite people to know more about anime.

Note

**Subbed Anime and Dubbed Anime**

There are two common ways to enjoy the anime world, subbed anime and dubbed anime. A “sub” is an anime-type that is shown in its original Japanese voice with subtitles of another language (mostly English). While the “dub” anime is the one that is released with a new re-scripted voice – voice actors speaking another language recorded as voiceover to make it suitable for a worldwide audience.

Though the topic is often a debatable topic among anime fandom. I’ll just highlight my thoughts on both versions. As anime is mostly Japanese creation and watching them in the western world required either an English subtitle or dubbed over by English-speaking voice actors.

Anime hardcore fans or purists argue the original voice and theme of the anime should not be altered to keep the original imaginative flair and theme of the series. While the dubbed anime released with a re-scripted voice track translated into English or any other language for that matter to allow a larger audience to enjoy the anime series without the hassle of reading through the subtitles.

## **Part 2: What is Manga?**

Manga, on the other hand, is the Japanese version of comic books and graphic novels. It has the same detailed and amplified facial features with a vivid and bright color combination. The Japanese word manga came from man-, meaning aimless, while, -ga, means pictures. So, it means aimless pictures.

Manga is unlike the usual superhero comics such as Marvel Comics or D.C. Comics written by many writers and editorial boards. Manga is more detailed and complete like novels that often are the vision of a single author. Mostly following the lives of seemingly ordinary people to develop an interesting and engaging experience – a cliffhanger.

## **Part 3: What is Cartoon?**

The word cartoon comes from the Italian word cartoon meaning a large sheet of card or paper. The word cartoon generally signifies a visual art as animation or a funny drawing while in a historical perspective it can refer to a preparatory drawing for an oil painting, fresco, or tapestry. A cartoon in literal meaning is a caricature intended as satire or a one-dimensional non-realistic or semi-realistic portrayal.

In the 19th century, cartoons were humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers transforming into comic strips and animated films in the early 20th century, as we know them now.

You may have heard of Anime. **What is Anime?** Anime, Manga, and Cartoons all are the exquisite openings of little portals into the other worlds that will entertain, delight, and educate you at the same time. They are the forms of art and words creating a unique medium for sharing the realities of the world, spirituality, and ideas.

The digital world has grown so immensely, and then Amine, Manga, and Cartoon have become popular in the whole world that people often confuse these terms. To understand them better and to decode the myth of anime, manga, and cartoon, we’ll go deeper into each and see what anime is, and show the differences in anime, manga, and cartoon.

* [**Part 1:** **What is Anime?**](#part1)
* [**Part 2:** **What is Manga?**](#part2)
* [**Part 3:** **What is Cartoon?**](#part3)
* [**Part 4:** **Differences between Anime, Manga, and Cartoon**](#part4)

## **Part 1: What is Anime?**

Anime is the Japanese form of animation – word for word. This scrupulous style and form of animation originated in Japan characterized by its vivid imagination and bright color usage. The thematic elements of fantasy and fiction combined with science give this style its unique look and feel. This meticulously thought and designed animation is nowadays produced all around the world intending its huge fanbase not just in the Japanese but all over the world.

The story is behind the word anime is interesting – the Japanese animēshiyon is a loanword from English animation, which then made its journey back to English as anime. So, the Japanese borrowed it from English and the English took it back modified. This modified version of animation became the basis of many popular TV shows and movies that excite people to know more about anime.

Note

**Subbed Anime and Dubbed Anime**

There are two common ways to enjoy the anime world, subbed anime and dubbed anime. A “sub” is an anime-type that is shown in its original Japanese voice with subtitles of another language (mostly English). While the “dub” anime is the one that is released with a new re-scripted voice – voice actors speaking another language recorded as voiceover to make it suitable for a worldwide audience.

Though the topic is often a debatable topic among anime fandom. I’ll just highlight my thoughts on both versions. As anime is mostly Japanese creation and watching them in the western world required either an English subtitle or dubbed over by English-speaking voice actors.

Anime hardcore fans or purists argue the original voice and theme of the anime should not be altered to keep the original imaginative flair and theme of the series. While the dubbed anime released with a re-scripted voice track translated into English or any other language for that matter to allow a larger audience to enjoy the anime series without the hassle of reading through the subtitles.

## **Part 2: What is Manga?**

Manga, on the other hand, is the Japanese version of comic books and graphic novels. It has the same detailed and amplified facial features with a vivid and bright color combination. The Japanese word manga came from man-, meaning aimless, while, -ga, means pictures. So, it means aimless pictures.

Manga is unlike the usual superhero comics such as Marvel Comics or D.C. Comics written by many writers and editorial boards. Manga is more detailed and complete like novels that often are the vision of a single author. Mostly following the lives of seemingly ordinary people to develop an interesting and engaging experience – a cliffhanger.

## **Part 3: What is Cartoon?**

The word cartoon comes from the Italian word cartoon meaning a large sheet of card or paper. The word cartoon generally signifies a visual art as animation or a funny drawing while in a historical perspective it can refer to a preparatory drawing for an oil painting, fresco, or tapestry. A cartoon in literal meaning is a caricature intended as satire or a one-dimensional non-realistic or semi-realistic portrayal.

Image resource: [Mr. Bean Cartoon World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF48Ur2dbMM)

Did you see Mr Bean Cartoon? A cartoon can be animated, a motion picture of a sequence of illustrations causing it to feel like a moving caricature. In the 19th century, cartoons were humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers transforming into comic strips and animated films in the early 20th century, as we know them now.

## **Part 4: Differences between Anime, Manga, and Cartoon**

Here we will talk about the differences between anime, manga, and cartoon from the following three aspects:

### **1\. Relation**

To effectively understand the difference between anime and manga you need to remember this little trick for anime vs manga,

* Most manga can be never converted to an anime series. But numerous manga serves as a basis for anime. Put in another way – anime is mostly, but not always, is the animated form of manga.
* Anime and manga are character-oriented where characters have goals in life that play a large thematic role in their life and the stories revolve around that.
* However, the cartoon vs manga and anime is another story altogether,
* In the western world comics and novels became animated cartoons with the advent of the digital age. In Japanese and wider Asia, the manga which is the Japanese version of comics and print cartoons turned into animated cartoons – anime.

### **2\. Content**

* Anime is a distinctive art form with diverse production techniques, it amalgamates graphic art, cinematography, characterization, and other imaginative techniques. Anime is hand-drawn, which separates it from reality into the fiction realm that provides an ideal path for the fantasy world.
* Manga showcases an illuminative and vivid imagination of the creator in the form of magazines and publications. The content incites the reader to engage deep into the artistic world of the creator.
* A cartoon is also a form of art, including and not limited to humorous illustrations, political and satirical drawings, and animated films. From art to entertainment, and political commentary, cartoons play an essential role in influencing the world.

### **3\. Style**

* While the western design cartoon has its specific features and details and the Japanese manga and anime have their rich history and imaginative flair to them. On the whole, they are part of the same family of art and human illustration techniques developed to showcase the tingling visualization of the creator.

## **Conclusion**

The Japanese storytelling is so rich and vibrant filled with dynamic characters and caricatures which serve as the best entertaining setting for both children and adults. All of these art forms have their dedicated audience which reveres one or the other. Creators that depict their vivid imagination into eloquent and exquisite characters conveying some message and thought-provoking idea. So, altogether none is better than the other and there are millions and millions of people reading and watching all these forms of artistic mastery. Just pick the one you love!

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.

### 7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)

Himiko is a cute-looking girl that possesses the ability to shapeshift to anything she wants. The creepy part is, in order to shapeshift she has to ingest another person’s blood.

Though Himiko appears to be a typical funny school girl, she can turn into a murderous beast in the blink of an eye. Her twister view of relationships and her trying to befriend people while trying to kill them at the same time all give us creepy chills while watching the anime.

### 8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)

Though Hana Midorikawa looks very cute and innocent she is as creepy as any girl can get. The story evolves in an underground prison school which is an explainable aspect that made Hana the sadist she is.

At first, Hana might seem to be a cute girl who does not belong at the place she currently is, but going deeper the opinion of the audience changes extremely. Hana happens to be a violent sociopath with a lot of dangerous thoughts and a urination fetish, and that is just the beginning of her creepiness.

![hana-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hana-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)

Isabella who is also known as Mama is one of the main characters in the Promised Land. Being a caretaker to children, though she appears to be loving and affectionate to her children, that’s not the real case.

Isabella has a twisted character and shows detachment to her tragedies. This character shows antagonism, betrayal, and a twisted nature enough for the fans to feel creepy about her.

![isabella-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-isabella-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)

Lucy in Elfen Lied is a character that sometimes gets sympathy and other times creeps the audience out. She has difficulty drawing a line between good and evil. She can be seen as being sadistically tormented and ruthlessly tormenting about the cruelty around her.

Her surroundings and the people are responsible for how she is and that is why despite being creepy she is loved by a lot of people.

![lucy-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-lucy-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

Even though girls are usually displayed as cute and pinkish and lovely, some animes display them as creepy. And believe me, these creepy anime girls have a huge fan base and are capable of giving the audience a chill over the spine while watching them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

* [1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)](#part1)
* [2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)](#part2)
* [3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)](#part3)
* [4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)](#part4)
* [5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)](#part5)
* [6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)](#part6)
* [7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)](#part7)
* [8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)](#part8)
* [9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)](#part9)
* [10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)](#part10)

### 1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

![hell-girl-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hell-girl-scary-anime.jpg)

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

There is too much to the story, and saying more about it may reveal the suspense. The story is filled with horror and adventure, and the character of Shion absorbs some of the darkness of the town, which gives a scary impact on the audience.

![higurashi-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-higurashi-scary-anime.jpg)

### 3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)

Sachiko from Corpse Party is a friendly-looking but scary character who loves to rip out the tongues of some of her fellow characters. She tortures students in Heavenly Host Elementry School which is a living hell in the anime.

Sachiko unleashes a lot of horror in the series and she plays the part of an elementary school ghost breaking all the expectations of the audience. Torturing her fellow mates and cutting their tongues out before death is something that makes Sachiko a perfect scary anime girl.

![corpse-party-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-corpse-party-scary-anime.jpg)

### 4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)

Shiro, the creepy-looking girl from Deadman Wonderland is another character to be scared of. She was adopted for the only purpose of being used as a human experiment in her childhood. The experiments instilled a very scary character in her which gives a horror nature to the anime in total.

The experiments on here were very painful and multiple personalities called "The Wretched Egg" were developed by her to cope up with torture. The creepy nature and the use of her special skills to murder some characters in the anime and frame her adopted brother for it is very dark and scary.

![shiro-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-shiro-scary-anime.jpg)

### 5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)

Megumi Shimizu of Shiki is a young girl and the first of all to be killed by the Kirishiki family. She was the first person who died who was not Yamairi and also the first to rise as Shiki.

After becoming a Shiki Megumi became very malicious and attacked the villagers. She enjoyed attacking them and that is very creepy. She also was ready to kill Tohru Mutou and Kaori’s father due to some small reasons. Her character without a drop of sympathy or care for the people around her is very scary and makes her very unpredictable.

![shiki-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-shiki-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)

Esdeath in Akame Ga Kill who is also known as the ice queen of the empire is a very manipulative character and a sadist. She follows the motto, the strong survive and the weak die, and justifies killing innocents and torturing enemies because of it.

Esdeath once made a prince who lost to strip naked before her and lick her boots, before killing his which is a different level of dark. She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.
