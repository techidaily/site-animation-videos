### Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials

Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for **animated travel map** preparation:

**Step 1:** Get the Map

The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:

* Launch your preferred web browser
* Type **google.com** in the address bar or the search box and hit **Enter**
* Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen

![Get Travel Maps from Google Map](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg)

* Type **Snipping Tool** in the **Cortana** search box present on the left side of the **Taskbar**
* Launch **Snipping Tool**, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map

**Note:** **Snipping Tool** is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.

* Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC

**Step 2:** Mark Out the Map Path

The next step in the process of preparing an **animated travel map** is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, **Microsoft Paint** is used here, and the method is given below:

* Right-click the screenshot you just captured
* Go to **Open with** on the context menu, and then click **Paint** from the submenu that appears
* Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as **Red**
* Use the **Sphere** shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map
* Use the **Line** tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic
* Go to **File** \> **Save As**, and save the marked image with a different name

**Note:** Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it

**Step 3:** Download Some Travel Icons

Another important ingredient in an effective **travel map animation** is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car/bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer [royalty-free stock photos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at absolutely no cost are listed below:

* [Wondershare Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers/creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms & Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.

**Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance**

Go to **Transition** from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the **Erase Slide** transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.

![add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-animated-travel-map.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview and Export**

Press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** window, select **MP4** from the formats list in the left, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.

**Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media**

Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.

* Click **Add** to add the first keyframe

![add animations to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-animation-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Move a couple of frames further, and click **Add** one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the **Scale** slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.

![add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.
* After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.
* Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project**

Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to **Transition**, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably **Dissolve**, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.

## Method 2 How to Make Interactive Animated Travel Map with Pictramap

If you don’t want to install a dedicated animation software on your computer due to limited hardware resources or some other reason, there is an online solution called Pictramap to create a **travel map animation** using a web browser. The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.

The process to create an **animated travel map** with Pictramap is given below:

**Step 1: Create a Project**

Launch your favorite web browser, go to <https://www.pictramap.com/>, click **Create yours now, it’s free**, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the **Dashboard**, enter a name in the field available under the **My Projects** section, and click **Create** to create a new project (the animated map).

![create travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pictramap-interface.jpg)

**Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute**

On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click **Add**. Click the location marker, click the **Travel Mode** icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.

![edit travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pictramap-travel-mode-edit.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview the Animation**

![preview created travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-animated-travel-map-pictramap.jpg)

### Downsides of Using Pictramap to Create Animated Travel Map Video

Although Pictramap allows you to create a **travel map animation** with ease and extremely quickly, at the time of this writing, it offers no way of downloading the animation to your PC, and therefore it couldn’t be used in your projects.

If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.

## Method 3 How To Make Animated Travel Map Using Multidev

Multi.dev is still a new web-based application to build awesome animated maps, but it’s good! The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.

So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.

**Step 1: Open Multi.dev**

Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.

![multidev 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png)

Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.

**Step 2: Choose Your First Location**

Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.

Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!

![multidev 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-2.png)

**Step 3: Select Map Themes**

All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.

![multidev 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-3.png)

**Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer**

If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.

![multidev 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png)

![multidev 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png)

Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.

## Conclusion

An **animated travel map** plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.

Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.

### Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials

Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for **animated travel map** preparation:

**Step 1:** Get the Map

The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:

* Launch your preferred web browser
* Type **google.com** in the address bar or the search box and hit **Enter**
* Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen

![Get Travel Maps from Google Map](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg)

* Type **Snipping Tool** in the **Cortana** search box present on the left side of the **Taskbar**
* Launch **Snipping Tool**, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map

**Note:** **Snipping Tool** is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.

* Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC

**Step 2:** Mark Out the Map Path

The next step in the process of preparing an **animated travel map** is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, **Microsoft Paint** is used here, and the method is given below:

* Right-click the screenshot you just captured
* Go to **Open with** on the context menu, and then click **Paint** from the submenu that appears
* Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as **Red**
* Use the **Sphere** shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map
* Use the **Line** tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic
* Go to **File** \> **Save As**, and save the marked image with a different name

**Note:** Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it

**Step 3:** Download Some Travel Icons

Another important ingredient in an effective **travel map animation** is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car/bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer [royalty-free stock photos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at absolutely no cost are listed below:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
* [Wondershare Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers/creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms & Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.

### Part 2: Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora

### Downsides of Using Pictramap to Create Animated Travel Map Video

Although Pictramap allows you to create a **travel map animation** with ease and extremely quickly, at the time of this writing, it offers no way of downloading the animation to your PC, and therefore it couldn’t be used in your projects.

If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.

## Method 3 How To Make Animated Travel Map Using Multidev

Multi.dev is still a new web-based application to build awesome animated maps, but it’s good! The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.

So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.

**Step 1: Open Multi.dev**

Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.

![multidev 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png)

Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.

**Step 2: Choose Your First Location**

Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.

Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!

![multidev 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-2.png)

**Step 3: Select Map Themes**

All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.

![multidev 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png)

Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.

## Conclusion

An **animated travel map** plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.

Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.

**Animated travel map** videos make it easy for the viewers to follow the routes from the source to destination locations right on the single screen. While the static maps would only allow the audience to see the markers from where the journey would start and is expected to end, the animated ones show the real-time movements and therefore look more interactive when viewed.

That said, here you will learn how to create an attractive and engaging **animated travel map** video using one of the easiest post-production applications, Wondershare Filmora, which is widely appreciated by amateurs and professionals throughout the globe. In another section, you will also learn about an alternative program that might be of some help in case you are more into online designing.

* [Part 1\. Prepare the Travel Map Materials](1.1)
* [Part 2\. Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora](1.2)

### Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials

Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for **animated travel map** preparation:

**Step 1:** Get the Map

The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:

* Launch your preferred web browser
* Type **google.com** in the address bar or the search box and hit **Enter**
* Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen

![Get Travel Maps from Google Map](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg)

* Type **Snipping Tool** in the **Cortana** search box present on the left side of the **Taskbar**
* Launch **Snipping Tool**, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map

**Note:** **Snipping Tool** is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.

* Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC

**Step 2:** Mark Out the Map Path

The next step in the process of preparing an **animated travel map** is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, **Microsoft Paint** is used here, and the method is given below:

* Right-click the screenshot you just captured
* Go to **Open with** on the context menu, and then click **Paint** from the submenu that appears
* Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as **Red**
* Use the **Sphere** shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map
* Use the **Line** tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic
* Go to **File** \> **Save As**, and save the marked image with a different name

**Note:** Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it

**Step 3:** Download Some Travel Icons

Another important ingredient in an effective **travel map animation** is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car/bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer [royalty-free stock photos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at absolutely no cost are listed below:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
* [Wondershare Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers/creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms & Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.

### Part 2: Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora

After you have gathered all the necessary ingredients that are required to create a **travel map animation**, it is now time to get to work. The following instructions would guide you through the step-by-step process of preparing a decent and realistic **animated travel map** in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

**Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline**

Launch the [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your computer, click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.

![create animated travel map in Filmora - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg)

**Note:** Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.

**Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance**

Go to **Transition** from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the **Erase Slide** transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.

![add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-animated-travel-map.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview and Export**

Press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** window, select **MP4** from the formats list in the left, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.

**Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media**

Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.

![customize animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-animated-travel-map.jpg)

Next, position the **Skimmer** (**Playhead**) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the **Skimmer** a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing **Delete** on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.

![trim animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-cut-animated-travel-map.jpg)

Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to **Speed and Duration** from the context menu. On the **Custom Speed** box, drag the **Speed** slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the **Speed** box to get precise tenure. Click **OK** when you are done.

![adjust the speed of animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-travel-map-speed-duration.jpg)

**Step** **5:** **Add** **Animations to Travel Map**

Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to **Add Animation** from the context menu. Make sure that the **Skimmer** is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:

* Click **Add** to add the first keyframe

![add animations to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-animation-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Move a couple of frames further, and click **Add** one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the **Scale** slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.

![add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.
* After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.
* Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project**

Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to **Transition**, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably **Dissolve**, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.

Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to **Titles** on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click **OK** when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.

Once everything is complete, click the **Play** button in the **Preview** window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the **animated travel map** in your preferred format.

* [Part 2\. Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora](1.2)

### Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials

Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for **animated travel map** preparation:

**Step 1:** Get the Map

The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:

* Launch your preferred web browser
* Type **google.com** in the address bar or the search box and hit **Enter**
* Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen

![Get Travel Maps from Google Map](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg)

* Type **Snipping Tool** in the **Cortana** search box present on the left side of the **Taskbar**
* Launch **Snipping Tool**, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map

**Note:** **Snipping Tool** is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.

* Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC

**Step 2:** Mark Out the Map Path

The next step in the process of preparing an **animated travel map** is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, **Microsoft Paint** is used here, and the method is given below:

* Right-click the screenshot you just captured
* Go to **Open with** on the context menu, and then click **Paint** from the submenu that appears
* Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as **Red**
* Use the **Sphere** shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map
* Use the **Line** tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic
* Go to **File** \> **Save As**, and save the marked image with a different name

**Note:** Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it

**Step 3:** Download Some Travel Icons

Another important ingredient in an effective **travel map animation** is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car/bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer [royalty-free stock photos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at absolutely no cost are listed below:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
* [Wondershare Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers/creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms & Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.

### Part 2: Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora

After you have gathered all the necessary ingredients that are required to create a **travel map animation**, it is now time to get to work. The following instructions would guide you through the step-by-step process of preparing a decent and realistic **animated travel map** in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

**Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline**

Launch the [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your computer, click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.

![create animated travel map in Filmora - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg)

**Note:** Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.

**Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance**

Go to **Transition** from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the **Erase Slide** transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.

![add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-animated-travel-map.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview and Export**

Press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** window, select **MP4** from the formats list in the left, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.

**Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media**

Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.

![customize animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-animated-travel-map.jpg)

Next, position the **Skimmer** (**Playhead**) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the **Skimmer** a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing **Delete** on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.

![trim animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-cut-animated-travel-map.jpg)

Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to **Speed and Duration** from the context menu. On the **Custom Speed** box, drag the **Speed** slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the **Speed** box to get precise tenure. Click **OK** when you are done.

![adjust the speed of animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-travel-map-speed-duration.jpg)

**Step** **5:** **Add** **Animations to Travel Map**

Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to **Add Animation** from the context menu. Make sure that the **Skimmer** is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:

* Click **Add** to add the first keyframe

![add animations to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-animation-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Move a couple of frames further, and click **Add** one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the **Scale** slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.

![add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.
* After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.
* Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project**

Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to **Transition**, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably **Dissolve**, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.

Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to **Titles** on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click **OK** when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.

Once everything is complete, click the **Play** button in the **Preview** window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the **animated travel map** in your preferred format.

## Method 2 How to Make Interactive Animated Travel Map with Pictramap

If you don’t want to install a dedicated animation software on your computer due to limited hardware resources or some other reason, there is an online solution called Pictramap to create a **travel map animation** using a web browser. The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.

The process to create an **animated travel map** with Pictramap is given below:

**Step 1: Create a Project**

Launch your favorite web browser, go to <https://www.pictramap.com/>, click **Create yours now, it’s free**, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the **Dashboard**, enter a name in the field available under the **My Projects** section, and click **Create** to create a new project (the animated map).

![create travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pictramap-interface.jpg)

**Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute**

On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click **Add**. Click the location marker, click the **Travel Mode** icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.

![edit travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pictramap-travel-mode-edit.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview the Animation**

Click the **View Animation** button from the upper-right corner of the page to see the **animated travel map**.

![preview created travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-animated-travel-map-pictramap.jpg)

### Downsides of Using Pictramap to Create Animated Travel Map Video

Although Pictramap allows you to create a **travel map animation** with ease and extremely quickly, at the time of this writing, it offers no way of downloading the animation to your PC, and therefore it couldn’t be used in your projects.

If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.

## Method 3 How To Make Animated Travel Map Using Multidev

Multi.dev is still a new web-based application to build awesome animated maps, but it’s good! The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.

So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.

**Step 1: Open Multi.dev**

Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.

![multidev 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png)

Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.

**Step 2: Choose Your First Location**

Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.

Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!

![multidev 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-2.png)

**Step 3: Select Map Themes**

All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.

![multidev 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-3.png)

**Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer**

If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.

![multidev 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png)

![multidev 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png)

Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.

## Conclusion

An **animated travel map** plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.

Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.

The **Adobe Auto rigger** is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of **Adobe 3D Rigging**.) It's a perfect tool for beginners.

Especially those that aren't really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.

#### In this article

01 [What's Adobe Auto Rigger?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?](#Part 2)

03 [Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's Adobe Auto Rigger?**

Alright, so what is the **Adobe Auto Rigger** and how does it differ from **Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging** or **Adobe After Effects Rigging**? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.

It's all thanks to the third-party tool, **Mixamo**, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually **rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects**.) We'll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.

Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you're intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)

![Adobe Auto Rigger Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome1.png)

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

![Upload Custom Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome2.png)

### 02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters

The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters' tab (shown in the image below.)

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

![Browse for Auto-Rigged Characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome3.png)

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

![Adobe 3D Rigging with Mixamo Adobe Auto Rigger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome4.png)

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

![Upload Custom Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome2.png)

### 02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters

The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters' tab (shown in the image below.)

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

![Browse for Auto-Rigged Characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome3.png)

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

![Adobe 3D Rigging with Mixamo Adobe Auto Rigger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome4.png)

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

The **Adobe Auto rigger** is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of **Adobe 3D Rigging**.) It's a perfect tool for beginners.

Especially those that aren't really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.

03 [Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's Adobe Auto Rigger?**

Alright, so what is the **Adobe Auto Rigger** and how does it differ from **Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging** or **Adobe After Effects Rigging**? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.

It's all thanks to the third-party tool, **Mixamo**, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually **rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects**.) We'll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.

Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish.
