Charlie Brown, known as Charlie, is the main character in the comic strip Peanuts. This is a widely recognized American cartoon. Many people can relate to Charlie. Charlie is shy, nervous, and lacks confidence. These characteristics make him relatable to a chunk of common people.

### 02Fred Flintstone

I have known very few people who do not know about Fred Flintstone. Fred Flinstone is the protagonist of the famous American sitcom show Yabba-Dabba-Dinosaurs and the entire franchise. The Flinstone is another show that features Fred with his family. Of course, the show's main attraction is the Flinstone family and the way this show is set. This show is set in a way that romanticizes a family living in a cave. Coming to talk about skeletons, have you ever thought that what if a **skeleton cartoon show** version of The Flintstone were made. How would this short, fat man with almost a square look as a skeleton? We can look up here how the skeleton version of Fred Flintstone looks:

### 03Bubbles

The Bubble is one of the main characters of the popular TV cartoon show Powerpuff girls. The other protagonists are Blossom and Buttercup, her sisters. The Bubble is named Bubble because she is the bubbliest and most fun-loving among the three sisters. Bubble is a sweet little girl with a round face and big round eyes and short limbs. These characteristics in this character make it look cuter. But to think, how would we imagine Bubble in a skeleton version. This is how Bubble would look like a skeleton.

### 04Dexter

Dexter is the protagonist in the show Dexter's Laboratory. Dexter is one of the most outstanding kid scientists who have made great inventions in his secret laboratory. It would be more appropriate to call Dexter an anti-heroic protagonist. He works in his secret laboratory for various projects like stopping bullying worldwide. Dexter is a short young boy with curly hair. Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious. But this is how Dexter would look like a **skeleton cartoon.**

It has been used to fashion dresses, bags, and many more. How would it be if we sat to think of a skeleton version of this furry creature? This may not a pleasant experience for everyone. The perfect way to demonstrate pikachu as a skeleton version would be:

## Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Skeletons With Step by Step

Have you ever tried drawing **a skeleton cartoon character**? You can use a **skeleton cartoon** to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw **skeleton cartoon**. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:

**Step 1:** To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let's start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.

**Step 2:** The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.

![start with head skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.

**Step 4:** To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body's center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.

**Step 5:** After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.

![draw ribs skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-7.jpg)

**Step 6:** After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.

**Step 7:** The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.

**Step 8:** Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.

**Step 9:** Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

**Step 11:** After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.

**Step 12:** To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.

**Step 13:** Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.

**Step 14:** After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.

![draw upper half of the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-9.jpg)

**Step 15:** Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.

**Step 16:** After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.

**Step 17:** Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.

**Step 18:** Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.

![add feet skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-10.jpg)

**Step 19:** You can color your skeleton drawing or give your shading style after your skeleton drawing is done.

You can make quirky **skeleton cartoon** animations and compile them to a video, adding music effects. You might think you need different apps for the video and the audio editing part. That might be the case for other apps.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

**Step 11:** After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.

**Step 12:** To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.

**Step 13:** Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.

**Step 14:** After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.

![draw upper half of the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-9.jpg)

**Step 15:** Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.

**Step 16:** After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.

**Step 17:** Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.

**Step 18:** Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.

![add feet skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-10.jpg)

From our very childhood, we have come across numerous cartoons shows. But have we ever wondered how the skeleton of these cartoon characters would look? No worries if you have not given a thought to this. This article can give you a small tour of the world where you will be able to see skeletons of a few famous cartoon characters that we have known since our childhood. The skeletons of famous cartoon characters are:

### 01Charlie

Charlie Brown, known as Charlie, is the main character in the comic strip Peanuts. This is a widely recognized American cartoon. Many people can relate to Charlie. Charlie is shy, nervous, and lacks confidence. These characteristics make him relatable to a chunk of common people. Charlie is referred to as the "Loveable Loser."Charlie is an overwhelmingly short and stout character physically. Have you ever imagined how Charlie's skeleton version would look? Here is how the **skeleton cartoon** of Charlie would look.

![charlie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-1.jpg)

### 02Fred Flintstone

I have known very few people who do not know about Fred Flintstone. Fred Flinstone is the protagonist of the famous American sitcom show Yabba-Dabba-Dinosaurs and the entire franchise. The Flinstone is another show that features Fred with his family. Of course, the show's main attraction is the Flinstone family and the way this show is set. This show is set in a way that romanticizes a family living in a cave. Coming to talk about skeletons, have you ever thought that what if a **skeleton cartoon show** version of The Flintstone were made. How would this short, fat man with almost a square look as a skeleton? We can look up here how the skeleton version of Fred Flintstone looks:

### 03Bubbles

The Bubble is one of the main characters of the popular TV cartoon show Powerpuff girls. The other protagonists are Blossom and Buttercup, her sisters. The Bubble is named Bubble because she is the bubbliest and most fun-loving among the three sisters. Bubble is a sweet little girl with a round face and big round eyes and short limbs. These characteristics in this character make it look cuter. But to think, how would we imagine Bubble in a skeleton version. This is how Bubble would look like a skeleton.

![bubbles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-3.jpg)

### 04Dexter

Dexter is the protagonist in the show Dexter's Laboratory. Dexter is one of the most outstanding kid scientists who have made great inventions in his secret laboratory. It would be more appropriate to call Dexter an anti-heroic protagonist. He works in his secret laboratory for various projects like stopping bullying worldwide. Dexter is a short young boy with curly hair. Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious. But this is how Dexter would look like a **skeleton cartoon.**

### 05Pikachu

Pikachu is one of the characters or one of the Pokémons in the famous animated Japanese series Pokémon. Pikachu is a small yellow furry Pokémon. It seems very sweet to the audience and the general public, but it acquires a dangerous skill to give out an electric shock. This small yellow furry creature has featured in many films with the protagonist of the famous show Pokémon Ash Ketchum. This cartoon character has a presence in the fashion industry. It has been used to fashion dresses, bags, and many more. How would it be if we sat to think of a skeleton version of this furry creature? This may not a pleasant experience for everyone. The perfect way to demonstrate pikachu as a skeleton version would be:

## Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Skeletons With Step by Step

Have you ever tried drawing **a skeleton cartoon character**? You can use a **skeleton cartoon** to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw **skeleton cartoon**. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:

**Step 1:** To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let's start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.

**Step 2:** The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.

![start with head skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.

**Step 4:** To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body's center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.

**Step 5:** After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.

![draw ribs skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-7.jpg)

**Step 6:** After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.

**Step 7:** The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.

**Step 8:** Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.

**Step 9:** Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

Our topic for today's article is on that exact same subject. Or, rather, more specifically, **anime text-to-speech**.

For those who want more than the usual robotic text-to-speech AI that you see in more professional software. Learn more about all this below, we've prepared an entire guide for you!

#### In this article

01 [What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for Youtube](#Part 2)

03 [How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

![Natural Readers - Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers4.png)

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

![Cepstral Voices - Demo Voices Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers7.png)

## Part 4 **Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech**

Now, onto some more **anime text-to-speech** options that you can try in order to make your text-to-speech script sound exactly like your favorite cartoon or anime characters! For this list, we've not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:

### 01Flixier

Flixier is the first **anime text-to-speech** maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

**●** It comes with advanced team functionalities.

![Flixier Online Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers8.png)

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

![Woord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers9.png)

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

![Speechelo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers10.png)

### 04Cartoon Animator 4

Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you're really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.

**●** Free-to-use **text-to-speech anime character**

**●** Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.

**●** A wide variety of voice options to choose from.

![Cartoon Animator 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers11.png)

### 05TTS Reader

TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon/anime characters. It doesn't have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you're looking for is something easy to use.

**●** Available to use online for FREE.

**●** Variety of different voice options.

**●** Adjustable speed for voice.

![TTS Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers12.png)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

![Cepstral Voices - Demo Voices Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers7.png)

## Part 4 **Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech**

Now, onto some more **anime text-to-speech** options that you can try in order to make your text-to-speech script sound exactly like your favorite cartoon or anime characters! For this list, we've not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:

### 01Flixier

Flixier is the first **anime text-to-speech** maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

**●** It comes with advanced team functionalities.

![Flixier Online Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers8.png)

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

![Woord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers9.png)

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

![Speechelo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers10.png)

### 04Cartoon Animator 4

Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you're really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.

**●** Free-to-use **text-to-speech anime character**

**●** Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.

**●** A wide variety of voice options to choose from.

![Cartoon Animator 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers11.png)

### 05TTS Reader

TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon/anime characters. It doesn't have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you're looking for is something easy to use.

**●** Available to use online for FREE.

**●** Variety of different voice options.

**●** Adjustable speed for voice.

![TTS Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers12.png)

**Claymation** sculptures originate from blobs of clay. Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. **Clay animation** not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.

**Clay animation** also uses stop- motion animation. It includes capturing minute movements and of models to make it look like the characters is acting on their own.

04 [8 Famous Claymation Movies in 2022](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How Does Clay Animation Work?

**Claymation** sculptures originate from blobs of clay. Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. **Clay animation** not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.

**Clay animation** also uses stop- motion animation. It includes capturing minute movements and of models to make it look like the characters is acting on their own. In stop motion animation, animators typically shoot at fps or fps. Though some claymators prefer to capture it at half the rate, fps or fps whereas fps is frame per second these captured still images are edited then converted into a video or film using stop motion software.

In recent times use of editing software and developed cameras has made the shooting process easier. Also, armatures clay models have eased the process of creating sculptures. Though, time is still a great deal while making clay animation.

## Part 2 What Are Some Famous Clay Animation Characters?

**●** **Wallace:** The character was born during the 80’s, back when stop motion was relatively unheard of. Wallace is the star of the franchise featuring Wallace and Gromit. The idea of this dynamic duo took about seven years to turn into a full scale television show. It went to becoming an Oscar winning work of art.

**●** **Victor Van Dort (Corpse Bride):** The persona of a handsome man in his prime. Short and messy brown vest over a slim structure with big brown eyes. The protagonist of the corpse bride, Victor is a character in conflict stuck within an epic love triangle involving the dead. This amazing dark satire brings out the best in clay animation with precise movements and amazing music.

**●** **Rocky (Chicken Run):** Mel Gibson went out on a foot with Rocky, though he is known for the same. Rocky is the second character with prominence in the film. The plot is about chickens attempting to escape their inevitable demise. Rocky crash lands in the coop pretending to have figured out how to fly.

**●** **Coraline:** Not your everyday story about an eleven year old. Coraline Jones continues to haunt/impact us all even today and has a strong cult backing. It was initially meant to be live action but was later shifted to Claymation which took over four years to make.

**●** **Shaun the Sheep:** Shaun is a sheep (obviously) who goes on world adventures. The movies was featured as the TV spin off. The character was meant to appeal to both children and family. The entire movie was dependant on movement and expressions rather than dialogue making Claymation the perfect medium to bring out the character.

## Part 3 How Many Changes Does a Clay Animation Movie Require?

It is difficult to say what is the exact time taken by a Claymation production as all stop motion movies are unique and require a considerable amount of time to make.

An estimate made by Fords depicted that that it took a single two minute footage of ‘Boxtrolls’ a week to make. The total running time ended at 1 hour minutes.

## Part 4 8 Famous Claymation Movies in 2022

**Claymation** movies showing up on the silver screen is a rare event but they have often regular staple for cartoon television series. Despite the fact that the process is time consuming and labor intensive some of the best filmmakers and animators still prefer Claymation as a medium. Though recently, CGI based animations are taking up the vast market share of animated films, clay animations have been around for quite a while even before Plasticine. Here is a list of some of the most memorable Claymation flicks.

### 01Wallace and Gromit – The Curse of the Were-Rabbit

![wallaca and gromit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-1.jpg)

The British stop-motion comedy franchise which had 5 installation had been a first of its kind. The characters Wallace and Gromit later inspired their own movie "Wallace and Gromit – The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" which was released back in 20by Dreamworks Animation. The mystery solving duo ran a pest control company while Wallace experiments on a brain washing gadget for dissuading wild rabbits which leads to its own disaster. This movie has a classic appeal amongst children an adults alike.

### 02The Nighmare before Christmas (1993)

![nightmare before christmas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-2.jpg)

Directed by Time Burton, this film is one that impresses us all every time. The success of this Claymation is embedded in the fact that it made creepy gothic characters look appealing. It has a mixture of both the Halloween and Christmas theme. The character Jack Skellington goes through a magic door to arrive at ‘Christmas Town’. Using Claymation was an excellent choice for the script as it enabled the animators to bring about that distorted movements that evolved into a gorgeous visual storytelling.

### 03Chicken Run (1994)

![chicken run](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-3.jpg)

Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.

### 04The Corpse Bride (2005)

![corpse bride](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-this-post-can-teach-you-about-clay-animation-4.jpg)

The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.

### 05Coraline (2009)

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

#### In this article

01 [All You Need to Know About 2D Rigging](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Difference and Connection Between 2D and 3D](#Part 2)

03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

![2D Character Looking at a Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you2.png)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

![Storyboard Creation. Creating 2D & 3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you3.png)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.
