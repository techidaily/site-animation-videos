We will discuss animated characters to draw in hand. There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.

### 01 Smurfette

Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.

So, in general, it's best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.

### 01Angelica Pickles

Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.

### 03Yogi Bear

Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.

### 04Magilla Gorilla

Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera's Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.

### 05Top Cat

Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He's wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he's making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones' basic Hanna-Barbera art style.

### 06Helga. G. Pataki

Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There's a lot that's bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it. Just keep an eye on her head since getting it correct, especially with her rectangle hairdo, can be a little odd.

These are some of the **cool animated characters to draw.**

## Part 3 **4 Best Drawing Exercise for Creating Cartoon Characters**

You'll learn how to create cartoon characters individually, including their faces, hair, and facial expressions.

### 01How to Draw Cartoon Characters

We'll go through the fundamentals of human perception before getting into cartoon face drawing. Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.

![Boy and Girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ultimate-guide-to-animated-characters-drawings-07.jpg)

### 02Here, you will learn How to Draw a Cartoon Face

Let us begin with a sketch of a cartoon face. A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.

Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.

Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.

![Face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ultimate-guide-to-animated-characters-drawings-08.jpg)

When creating a nose from the front, it's typical to leave off many details. Even if you merely sketch its tip, it will likely provide a convincing impact. Drawing only one side of the nose is also quite frequent. Children's mouths are extremely simple in cartoon style, regardless of gender.

The ears are viewed from the front; therefore, the internal holes are not visible. The circle has already established the shape of our head.

![Nose and Ear](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ultimate-guide-to-animated-characters-drawings-09.jpg)

### 03Let's learn about How to Draw a Cartoon Hair

Keep in mind that our characters' hair is essential for identifying their personalities, and it can also indicate their age. So, all we need is an effortless and playful haircut to bring our boy to life. Because there is no particular method for drawing hair, you'll have to experiment until you find the perfect look. Look for photo references on the internet! Take a look at a magazine shoot or a Google search.

![Hair](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ultimate-guide-to-animated-characters-drawings-10.jpg)

### 03How to Draw Characters with different Facial Expressions

By simply following the instructions below, you'll notice that you can completely transform his expression: Lowering one brow and raising the other, eyelashes are used to cut the eyes in half, putting a smile on the face one side is higher.

To stay under the eyelashes, move the eye pupils up. That's all there is to it! With just a few tweaks, we achieved the desired result. The circular form of the eyes, hair, ears, nose, chin and the circular shape of the ears are all the same! It's that simple!

Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

02 [Differences between 2d animation and 3d animation](#Part 2)

03 [A roaster of 8 best 3d animation software.](#Part 3)

04 [Top 3 3d animation making mistakes to avoid](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

![2d animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3danimation-01.jpeg)

animations are like the ones Dreamworks, Pixar, produce. They include the avengers, the bad guys, etc.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

![2d animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3danimation-01.jpeg)

animations are like the ones Dreamworks, Pixar, produce. They include the avengers, the bad guys, etc.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

## Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?

A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry. These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.

## Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations

3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.

### 01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients

Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his/her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.

### 02Training Of Medical Professionals

Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures.

## Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?

A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry. These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.

## Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations

3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.

### 01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients

Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his/her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.

### 02Training Of Medical Professionals

Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.

### 03Educating New Professionals

For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.

### 04Used As A Marketing Tool

Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.

### 05Marketing To Medical Professional

While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.
