First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop 'Image Stack'. This can be done by clicking the 'File' tab and selecting the 'Scripts > Load Files into Stack…' option

But, it is a very professional method of creating an animated GIF — one that will allow you to control every step of the process (which may be exactly what you want)

****Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack**

First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop 'Image Stack'. This can be done by clicking the 'File' tab and selecting the 'Scripts > Load Files into Stack…' option

Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click 'OK' when done

****Step 3: (Optional) Import Video**

If you want to work on a video to turn into a GIF instead, you can do such by selecting the 'File' tab and clicking on the 'Import > Video Frames to Layers…' option. This will get you to the same place shown in Step 2

Note: Just be careful that you do not transfer an image that is too long Photoshop may not be able to properly break it down, if so.
