Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

## Part 1 **How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow**

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**●** It would be the user's profile URL + feed/RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser's URL. That is your profile URL.

**●** For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser's URL bar.

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

Put in the converted Pinterest RSS feed URL from step 2 into the Feed URL text box.

Click Save and view your blog.

## Part 2 **How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest**

If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

![Log into your Pinterest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-4.jpg)

**Step 2: Add Title**

Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe's title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.

**Step 3: Select a Board**

The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.

If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

**Step 2: Add Title**

Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe's title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.

**Step 3: Select a Board**

The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.

Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as "Courtesan of Death." She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.

When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it's not a surprise that Diabolik Lover's Yui Komori is everyone's favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty.

She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.

### 13\. Revy-Black Lagoon

![revy anime character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-revy-anime-character.jpg)

No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can't really relate to this complex **female anime character** until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.

Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.

### 15\. Esdeath- Akame ga Kill

![esdeath female anime-character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/15-esdeath-female-anime-character.jpg)

Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath's spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General's apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father's death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.

## What Makes a Female Anime Character Stand out?

A bunch of unique and exciting anime characters is released every year. While some of these turn out lovable gems, others prove long-forgotten failures. But what is it about an anime character that makes it stand out?

Everything shapes the perfect leading anime character, from their personalities to their clothes and styling to the character development. Memorable **anime girl characters** are rare, well-written protagonists with profound nature, exciting stories, and emotions that relate to anime fans.

So, which **female anime character** is your favorite?

You can't really relate to this complex **female anime character** until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years.

As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General's apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots.

Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father's death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.
