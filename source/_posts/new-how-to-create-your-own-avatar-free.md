Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

![Log into your Pinterest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-4.jpg)

**Step 2: Add Title**

Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe's title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.

**Step 3: Select a Board**

Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

03 [How to display Pinterest’s latest pins in a slideshow? ](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow**

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**●** It would be the user's profile URL + feed/RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser's URL. That is your profile URL.

**●** For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser's URL bar.

![Construct Pinterest Feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

![Add the Slideshow Widget](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-2.jpg)

Under Source, select Other.

![Add the Slideshow Widget 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-3.jpg)

Put in the converted Pinterest RSS feed URL from step 2 into the Feed URL text box.

Click Save and view your blog.

## Part 2 **How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest**

If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

![Log into your Pinterest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-4.jpg)

**Step 2: Add Title**

Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe's title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.

**Step 3: Select a Board**

The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.

## Part 3 **How to Make Pinterest Slideshow In 5 Simple Ways**

![Loop Animation Forever](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif12.png)
