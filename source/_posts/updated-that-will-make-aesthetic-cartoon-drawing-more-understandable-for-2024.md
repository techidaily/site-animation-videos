## Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva

Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.

Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.

### 2.1 How to animate text in Canva?

With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.

Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to "animate," you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.

In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.

Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.

Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.

### 2.4 How do you animate video in Canva?

Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.

Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.

Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.

Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.

### 2.1 How to animate text in Canva?

With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.

You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the "Animate" option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.

## Part 1 Create an animated video with a Canva template

In this section, we'll explore how to make animated video on Canva, which applies to both the free and pro account of Canva. However, the steps given below got created from Canva's free account. We suppose that you've already created an account on Canva and logged into the platform. So, further steps will proceed as follows:

Go to the Video tab given in the top front panel of Canva and choose any template of your desire. Let's say we've selected the very first template, 1920 × 1080 pixels. There are lots of options provided by Canva from where you can choose your favorites. You can also create a template with a custom size.

It's all done, and you can proceed with the next section.

## Part 2 Create Canva animated video with your video

We'll discuss how to create an animated video by uploading our video in Canva without using any template in this section. After logging in to the Canva account credentials, select the Video tab and choose the different templates offered.

We’ve selected a blank template for the purpose as follows.

![select blank template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-video-9.jpg)

Now, you need to head directly towards the Uploads tab and upload your video created over here.

![canva uploads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-video-5.jpg)

By now, you have most probably got over with uploading your media. Click the uploaded video, and it will automatically enter within the editing panel of Canva, as shown below.

![canva uploaded video”](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-video-4.jpg)

You're all done now, and it's all finished! Even though template usage is quite simple, it's pretty straightforward when you don't use any ready-made template. However, you can still beautify this simple video with different elements like text, music, etc.

Animation style videos influence people of all ages to whatever generation, or the kind you belong to will be one of them for sure.

Animated ones provoke diverse impacts instead of ordinary videos on the audience utilizing illustration, kinesthetic, etc. But the fact is, due to technological advancements and overexposure to social media sites, we have forgotten its significance.

Want to know some other most accessible software tools that can bring out the artist in you? Here is an alternative that is all you need.

Are you surprised to find that you can go with various animation styles to boost your business or bring out your talents? But are you confused about how to revamp your story and effectively film it? Why should you worry when the best animation maker and Canva's alternative [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is here exclusively for you to create fantastic animation videos that could stand out of the box?

### Conclusion

Lastly, don't forget to give Filmora a chance to upscale your creation and give your animation style a life!
