Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

![2D And 3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-are-the-differences-between-2d-and-3d-animation-01.jpg)

Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.

01 [Definition of 2D Animation 3D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [Key Differences Between 2D Animations and 3D Animations](#Part 2)

03 [Selecting Between 2D Animation and 3D Animation?](#Part 3)

04 [Merging 2D Animation and 3D Animation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.

Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.

Making an overall excellent and unique **character design cartoon art style** is sometimes hard. The truth is that everyone has a favorite cartoon character, but the question is, how does this character come to life? While you are about to start copying other well-known cartoon or comic characters, you will eventually branch out and come with your own. In addition, there are several ways to come up with ideas for cartoon characters' concept art to draw. Any of these ways can get you started on populating your world of cartoons.

![cartoon character design tips 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cartoon-character-design-1.jpg)

More so, the process of tackling your character design is often full of hurdles. This process requires a lot of creative thinking to create one's character from the beginning, although many well-known characters from films, advertising, and cartoons look straightforward. But need to exert a vast amount of skill and effort to make them effective.

## Part 1 Tips for Brilliant Cartoon Character Design

As a **cartoon character designer**, here are 10 tips you need to put in place to make a brilliant **cartoon character design**. They are;

**●** **Do not lose the magic**

Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.

The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.

![cartoon character design tips 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cartoon-character-design-2.jpg)

**●** **Avoid reference material**

Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn't have the reference material right in front of you as you work.

Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.

**●** **Make research on other characters**

For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.

**●** **Also, take a look elsewhere**

It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character's posture or idea's movement.

**●** **Try not to lose sight of the original idea**

It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.

**●** **Exaggerate**

When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters' essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.

**●** **Decide the aim of your character design**

When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your 'thing.' Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.

**●** **Make your character distinctive**

Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people's attention.

**●** **Create clear silhouettes**

A silhouette is required to help you understand the character's gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character 'reads' and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.

**●**   **Consider line quality**

Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.

## Part 1 Tips for Brilliant Cartoon Character Design

As a **cartoon character designer**, here are 10 tips you need to put in place to make a brilliant **cartoon character design**. They are;

**●** **Do not lose the magic**

Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.

The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.

![cartoon character design tips 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cartoon-character-design-2.jpg)

**●** **Avoid reference material**

Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn't have the reference material right in front of you as you work.

Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.

**●** **Make research on other characters**

For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.

**●** **Also, take a look elsewhere**

It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character's posture or idea's movement.

**●** **Try not to lose sight of the original idea**

It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.

**●** **Exaggerate**

When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters' essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits.
