The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an **online photo animator** and an application that you can download and install on your phone.

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites.
