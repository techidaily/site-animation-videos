### 03Write Your Own JavaScript Code

If you choose this solution, you'll have to start with writing HTML and CSS codes. This will help you style your web page in the beginning. And, once the web design is up and ready, you can move towards writing the JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll in your web page.

## Part 2 How to Create a Scrolling Text Animation (Infinite Loop)

Again, you can use different methods to **animate text on scroll** and make your website's content run in an infinite loop.

Some of these methods include:

### 01Use Filmora

![choose title template filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-04.JPG)

**Step 3 -** Again, double-click the title layer and you'll see a dedicated text editor on your screen. Here enter the text that you want to display within the video. You can also select text size, orientation, and font to personalize its appearance.

**Step 4 -** Finally, switch to the "Animation" tab at the left sidebar. Choose any of these animation templates and the text within the video will be animated automatically.

![animate title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-05.JPG)

So, that's how you can use Filmora to animate text-on-scroll to improve the overall visual appearance of your website videos.

### 02Scroll-Text-Animations for Single Words

Another way to implement scroll-text animations is to modify the HTML & CSS code of your website. Again, this method will only be feasible if you have prior coding experience and know how to write well-optimized code.

![one line animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-06.JPG)

So, that's how you can use Filmora to animate text-on-scroll to improve the overall visual appearance of your website videos.

### 02Scroll-Text-Animations for Single Words

Another way to implement scroll-text animations is to modify the HTML & CSS code of your website. Again, this method will only be feasible if you have prior coding experience and know how to write well-optimized code.

![one line animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-06.JPG)

The next step in making your anime montage is to cut the desired part of a few seconds from your anime video. We recommend you use Wondershare Filmora to [edit videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for this purpose. You can easily use the built-in screen recorder of Filmora to get the desired part from a full video. You can do it in a few simple steps.

Run Filmora on your computer, and if it is not installed, then you can download and install it from their official website.

Now go to file, click on record media, and then click on the record PC screen.

![record PC screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-4-websites-to-get-anime-footage-for-free-08.jpg)

A new window will open where you will see different recording options.

When your desired scene has been recorded, you may stop the recording whenever you like.

Once you stop the recording, the file will be automatically imported to Filmora, and now you can use it for creating your anime montage.
