### 3\. American Apparel

![american apparel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/make-animated-gif-1.gif)

American Apparel sells "power washed" T-shirts to make them "super soft."

This critical merit would not attract many users if it weren't for simulating the animated GIF of the T-shirts getting washed in an imaginary washing machine.

### 4\. Looper

One of the major motion pictures was Looper, that introduced us to the world's first "official" GIF movie poster when the film premiered. The clock GIF inside the first O is exclusively creative, and the incredible animated dust effect suggests that both characters are fading away due to the events in the movie.

### 5\. West Elm

West Elm offers modern furniture and various home decorations. In this email newsletter, they are presenting a selection of lamps, and what better way to showcase them than a GIF of them turning on at the same time.

Thus, these were the top five samples of our animated GIF tutorial you can take cue from right away.
