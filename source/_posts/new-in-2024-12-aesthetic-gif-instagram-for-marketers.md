## Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?

To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.

Let's say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.

## Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio

So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let's understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It's worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an **animated lower third in OBS** studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.

When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you'll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams.

But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don't have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.

Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your **OBS animated lower-third** graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you'll end up losing potential viewers.

## Part 1 What is Whiteboard Animation?

![whiteboard animation2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/definitive-guide-to-whiteboard-animation-2.jpg)

**Whiteboard animation** is a style that shows static watcher images getting drawn on the white screen. The graphics are at the core of a narration that walks the audience through the story by the draws. These animations are modest to understand, but they make us involved all of an impulsive.

**Whiteboard animation** could be a video in the middle of narration that walks the viewer through a story by viewing the illustrator's hand drawing it onto a white background. Established in 2007, **whiteboard animation** may be a new and exciting way of communicating to the viewer in a very personal way.

It applies effects like time-lapse and stop-motion to bring stories to life. Its uses include internal and external television and internet advertisements, software and product demonstrations, **whiteboard animation** lectures and educational videos for all ages, and various artistic possibilities like untrue storytelling.

**Whiteboard animation videos** are traditionally made by simply recording the artist live as they draw the content for the video while at the same time reciting the story. An efficient technique in these visually-oriented times, but a tricky balancing act for even the most effective illustrators and speakers.

### 01Recommended Age

Producing something creative with a Stop Motion Animation kit will be a lengthy process that will involve patience and some informational content to use the Kits properly. So while selecting the best Animation Kit, keep in mind the Recommended Age that the company has specified. If the product is for the young generation, the younger ones might have difficulty using the product.

### 02Different forms of Kits

You may check a few of them with different **Features** for the best stop animation kits. However, the significant difference between them is whether they come as complete kits or not. If you buy a complete kit, you will have a camera and other elements with the product.

The only thing you will require other than the entire animation kit would be a computer for software purposes. Moreover, you can also select Kits that do not come with a camera individually.

For this, you must use a smartphone to record the video. Conclusively, the kits present on the market are zoetrope-type kits. However, they are not available with electronics. So you won't be able to create full films with this one.

### 03Extra **Features**

As extra **Features**, you get Props and full-on sets included with some of the kits. These allow you to create the scenes that you are looking for. You can also transform the orientation of some of the props, which gives you extra functionality.

### 04Apps

When you're in the hustle to create a Stop Motion Animation, you need a few things. One of them is the smartphone or a camera. At the same time, the other one will be the App on your phone that will help you merge everything the way you wish it to be.

Some of the companies out there will create their apps, and it will assist you with different integration procedures, but if the kit you select is not available with a dedicated app. There are a lot of good apps on the market right now that you can go for. These 3rd party apps are unique and will get your job done too.

### 05 Software

You will either need an App or Proper Software for the putting-together part. This Software will need hardware such as either a laptop or a PC. Before deciding on an animation kit, make sure you know the system requirements if the kit is only supported through software.
