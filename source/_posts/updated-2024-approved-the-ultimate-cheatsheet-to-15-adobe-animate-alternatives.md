## Part 1 Adobe Animate - How It Became a Good Option Without Hesitation?

### 1\. How Much Do You Know About Adobe Animate Key Features?

The Adobe Creative Cloud is constantly updating its range of virtual tools with new features which give users twice more incentive to subscribe. Adobe Animate CC, which is basically the new Adobe Flash, has also received an update recently which installed a bundle of new features to its interface, making it even more irresistible to animators.

**What's new with Adobe Animate?**

**●** **Adobe Animate Camera**

Adding to Adobe's line of exclusivity is its all-new Adobe Virtual Camera. Using this feature, Adobe animate users can now control their animation camera movements giving your animation videos a more realistic feel.

**●** **Export any Format**

Exporting your animations to your desktop is a convenience every software should provide.

**●** **Audio Syncing**

Adobe Animate enables you to synchronize audio to your animations completely easily which is yet another feature that has been recently added.

**●** **Vector Brushes**

Though it resembles the same functionality with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate has renewed the tool with the ability to use tilt and pressure effects when drawing with a stylus or pen.

**●** **Web Fonts**

Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.

### 2\. What Lay Behind Adobe Animate Alternative?

When it comes to choosing the best premium animation software, Adobe Animate CC is the obvious choice, but what makes beginners hesitant in using Adobe Animate is the fact that you need to subscribe to Adobe Creative Cloud.

The Adobe Creative Cloud is constantly updating its range of virtual tools with new features which give users twice more incentive to subscribe. Adobe Animate CC, which is basically the new Adobe Flash, has also received an update recently which installed a bundle of new features to its interface, making it even more irresistible to animators.

**What's new with Adobe Animate?**

**●** **Adobe Animate Camera**

Adding to Adobe's line of exclusivity is its all-new Adobe Virtual Camera. Using this feature, Adobe animate users can now control their animation camera movements giving your animation videos a more realistic feel.

**●** **Export any Format**

Exporting your animations to your desktop is a convenience every software should provide.

**●** **Audio Syncing**

Adobe Animate enables you to synchronize audio to your animations completely easily which is yet another feature that has been recently added.

**●** **Vector Brushes**

Though it resembles the same functionality with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate has renewed the tool with the ability to use tilt and pressure effects when drawing with a stylus or pen.

**●** **Web Fonts**

Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.

Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to **turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop**, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.

Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.

### 01Brush Tool

A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.

### 02Graphic Tablet

It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.

### 03Pen Tool

Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.

Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.
