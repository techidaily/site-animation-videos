Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It's a good way of starting if you're not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won't demand any immediate monetary commitment.

Now, as for its features, today, we'll be focusing on **Blender Rigging** features.

#### In this article

01 [Why Use Blender Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]](#Part 2)

03 [Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Use Blender Rigging?**

**Blender Character Rigging** is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it's capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.

So, if you want to create video projects for your audience's entertainment or edification with animation, then **Blender Rigging** is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished **Blender Rigging** animations.)

![Blender Character Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes1.png)

## Part 2 **The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]**

For this next section, we're going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about **Blender Character Rigging**, **Blender Facial Rigging**, **Blender Muscle Rig**, and so on.

These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we've linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it's something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender' experience.)

### 01**Blender Character Rigging**

The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, **Blender Character Rigging**. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy **Blender character rigging**, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.

### 02**Blender Facial Rigging**

Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about **Blender Facial Rigging** from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of **Blender Rigging** tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face's character to become animated.)

### 03**Blender Muscle Rigging**

Creating a **Blender Muscle Rig** is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage' as you say, with your Animations. The video that we've attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of **Blender Rigging** in general and has extensively explained how to create a **Blender Human Rig** from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.

### 04**Blender Rigging**

Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional' methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It's an especially good skill to learn if you're more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)

### 05**Blender Rigging**

This next tutorial is an introduction to basic **Blender Rigging**. It's a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.

## Part 3 **Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course**

For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about **Blender Rigging**. Whether it be about **Blender character rigging**, **Blender facial rigging**, **free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs**, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.

### 01**Where to Learn the Course?**

The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters' **blender rigging** course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.

### 02**Other Tools to Learn Rigging**

As for other places to learn? We suggest the "Blender Fundamentals" course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is "Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of **Blender rigging** (including **Blender rigging** and **Blender rigging** videos.)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in trying out **blender rigging** yourself, you'll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.

**●** Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.

**●** For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common **Blender Rigging** subjects.

**●** If you're looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master's introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender's own "Blender Fundamental" series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you'll need to know.)

Here, I will let you know how to find and make free Christmas GIFs like a pro.

02 [How to Create your Animated Christmas GIFs (with Music): A DIY Guide](#Part 2)

03 [Pro Tip: Customize your GIFs on the Go with Filmora Meme Maker](#Part 3)

## Part 1  5 Best Places to Find Animated Christmas GIFs for Free

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

![pinterest christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-2.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

If you are looking for funny Christmas GIFs, then Giphy would be one of the best places to explore. It has some of the most extensive GIFs collections of all styles, including Christmas wishes GIFs.

You can head to the website of Giphy or use its mobile application to find all sorts of animated Christmas GIFs as per your needs. There are tons of stickers, animated stories, and funny GIFs related to pop cultures that you would also find on Giphy.

![giphy christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-3.jpg)

Drawings will always have a special place in storytelling. Whether you are demonstrating a new concept to a child, highlighting the features of a product to your bosses, or showcasing the intricacies of a marketing campaign, drawings make it easier for the audience to understand what is being said.

That is why it is so important to learn how to **create whiteboard animation**. When you learn how to create a whiteboard video with **[animate pictures app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, you are in a unique position when it comes to selling your story, and convincing others of what you already know.

* [**Part1: What is Whiteboard Animation Video?**](#part1)
* [**Part2: How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation**](#part3)

## Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?

To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.

Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using [2D animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.

When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.

To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.

## Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?

#### Step 1: Write a Script

Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.

It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/write-a-script.JPG)

#### Step 2: Start with the Storyboard

Now you have a script. You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.

When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboard.JPG)

#### Step 3: Create Images

If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.

![create image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-image.JPG)

#### Step 4: Animate Those Images

Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.

![animate drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-drawing.JPG)

#### Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio

The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.

![audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-audio.JPG)

## Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation

#### Evoke Empathy

The goal of a whiteboard animation video is not just to explain information in a cold and impersonal way. You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.

By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.

#### Personalize the Images

Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.

## Conclusion

Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project. And if you are wondering how you will edit your video, we recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use it to make animation video by adding keyframes, so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation. Besides, color correction and audio mixer will raise up your explainer video to a new level. Download it to have a try (Free)!

Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies. Although, DC remains the king regards to animated movies. DC animated movies are better coordinated with live-action scenes. Each story features different aspects of Gotham city and its issues.

Batman or "Bruce Wayne" is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time.

## Part 2 **10 Best Text Motion After Effects**

Alright, now let's move on to our promised **Text Motion Graphics After Effects** and **Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro** templates. We've tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!

### 01[**Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal' by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you're confused, it's a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.

Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.

### 02[**Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title**](https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The next **text motion** template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title' also created by Mogrt. This one is **text motion graphics** that you can use for **Premiere Pro** and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It's a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!

As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as **text motion** for [after effects](https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt), it is available for that as well!

### 03[**Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro**](https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?%5Fga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text' graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we've provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that's just starting out and doesn't want anything too complicated.

### 04[**30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt**](https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?%5Fga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets' by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It's also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

### 05[**Comic Bubbles MOGRT**](https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?%5Fga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

### 06[**Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?%5Fga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal' is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the **text motion graphics** are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It's perfect for those looking for underwater-themed **text motion graphics**. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.

This is **Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro**. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.

### 07[**Text Messages Toolkit**](https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?%5Fga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit' might be a fun **text motion graphics** for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it's a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message' interactions. It's customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that's what you want.

### 08[**Large Text Title Block**](https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/)

With the ‘large text title block' template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you're wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!

### 09[**Blueprint Titles**](https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?%5Fga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want something that's a little quirkier? Or, perhaps, instructional? Then the ‘Blueprint Titles' template is one that you can consider. As you can perhaps guess from the name, it allows you to create **text motion graphics** in a style that is similar to the kind of blueprints you usually see when working with design or architecture.

### 10[**Dynamic Minimalism**](https://videohive.net/item/dynamic-minimalism-essential-graphics-mogrt/21637324?s%5Frank=16&%5Fga=2.111208772.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)
