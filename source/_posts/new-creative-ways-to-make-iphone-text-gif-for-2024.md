## Part 2 How to Text a GIF on an iPhone Using a Third-Party App

Sending a GIF from an iPhone is also possible using third-party applications such as GIF Keyboard and GIPHY.

You must have downloaded them from App Store and installed them on your iPhone to use these applications.

You can also visit third-party websites to send GIFs from there. For example, GIPHY supports searching and sending GIFs via iMessage.

Here are the steps to follow to search and send **GIFs on iPhone text** messages on iMessage using third-party tools:

**Step 1**: Search for your desired GIF on GIPHY or other GIF websites.

Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.

The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.

**Step 1:** The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.

**Step 2:**Look for the "Asset warp tool" present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.

![asset warp tool adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** Create the first joint using the "Asset warp tool" by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the "Asset warp tool" forms the first joint.

![create joint adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the "Warp Options" and choose the "Tools" tab. There you will see the option of "Create bones". Ensure to enable the "Create bones" option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.

![add more joints adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg)

**Step 5:** Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.

![Complete the rig formation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg)

The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.

The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.

**Step 6:** You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the "Asset warp tool".

![hold and drag joint adobe animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg)

**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.

![hold and drag joint adobe animate 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg)

You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.

## Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Skeletons With Step by Step

Have you ever tried drawing **a skeleton cartoon character**? You can use a **skeleton cartoon** to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw **skeleton cartoon**. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:

**Step 1:** To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let's start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.

**Step 2:** The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.

![start with head skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.

**Step 4:** To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body's center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.

**Step 5:** After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.

![draw ribs skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-7.jpg)

**Step 6:** After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.

**Step 7:** The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.

**Step 8:** Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.

**Step 9:** Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

**Step 11:** After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.

**Step 12:** To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.

**Step 13:** Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.

**Step 14:** After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.

![draw upper half of the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-9.jpg)

**Step 15:** Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.

**Step 16:** After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.

**Step 17:** Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.

**Step 18:** Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.

![add feet skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-10.jpg)

**Step 19:** You can color your skeleton drawing or give your shading style after your skeleton drawing is done.

You can make quirky **skeleton cartoon** animations and compile them to a video, adding music effects. You might think you need different apps for the video and the audio editing part. That might be the case for other apps. Here is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**; you can edit your video, make slideshows, and edit the background sound score.

## Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Skeletons With Step by Step

Have you ever tried drawing **a skeleton cartoon character**? You can use a **skeleton cartoon** to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw **skeleton cartoon**. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:

**Step 1:** To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let's start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.

**Step 2:** The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.

![start with head skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.

**Step 4:** To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body's center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.

**Step 5:** After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.

![draw ribs skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-7.jpg)

**Step 6:** After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.

**Step 7:** The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.

**Step 8:** Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.

**Step 9:** Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

**Step 11:** After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.

**Step 12:** To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.

**Step 13:** Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.

**Step 14:** After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.

![draw upper half of the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-9.jpg)

**Step 15:** Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.

**Step 16:** After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.

**Step 17:** Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.

**Step 18:** Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.

![add feet skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-10.jpg)

02 [10 Best Text Motion After Effects](#Part 2)

03 [Tutorials for Making Great Text Motion](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's Text Motion?**

Alright, first of all, let's answer the big question! **Text Motion**, what is it and why should you be adding it to your projects ASAP? Well, in regards to the former, the answer is simple: **text motion graphics** is literally text animation that you can add to your projects to give it an extra bit of life and make it more show-stealing!

In regards to the latter, the answer is in its description! After all, why wouldn't you want your projects to be able to capture more attention?

![Text Motion Project with Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/why-these-10%2B-top-text-motion-templates-are-worth-your-attention1.png)

Have a look at the screenshot above that we included of an example project on the video editor, **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. As you can see, we inserted **text in motion** at the very start. And despite being a still screenshot of said **text motion graphics**, the preview is eye-catching even when paused!

This is the kind of project that you can do yourself with the right templates and the right video editor. We've got your back on the first in the list coming up. And, as for the second, we recommend that you try out Filmora! It is, as you can see, quite an expansive software. One that will allow you to truly make the most of the **text motion graphics** you'll be able to create at the end of this article.

## Part 2 **10 Best Text Motion After Effects**

Alright, now let's move on to our promised **Text Motion Graphics After Effects** and **Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro** templates. We've tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!

### 01[**Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal' by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you're confused, it's a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.

Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.

### 02[**Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title**](https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The next **text motion** template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title' also created by Mogrt. This one is **text motion graphics** that you can use for **Premiere Pro** and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It's a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!

As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as **text motion** for [after effects](https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt), it is available for that as well!

### 03[**Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro**](https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?%5Fga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text' graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we've provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that's just starting out and doesn't want anything too complicated.

### 04[**30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt**](https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?%5Fga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets' by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It's also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

### 05[**Comic Bubbles MOGRT**](https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?%5Fga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

### 06[**Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?%5Fga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal' is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the **text motion graphics** are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It's perfect for those looking for underwater-themed **text motion graphics**. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.

This is **Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro**. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.

### 07[**Text Messages Toolkit**](https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?%5Fga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit' might be a fun **text motion graphics** for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it's a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message' interactions. It's customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that's what you want.

### 08[**Large Text Title Block**](https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/)

With the ‘large text title block' template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you're wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!

### 09[**Blueprint Titles**](https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?%5Fga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want something that's a little quirkier? Or, perhaps, instructional? Then the ‘Blueprint Titles' template is one that you can consider. As you can perhaps guess from the name, it allows you to create **text motion graphics** in a style that is similar to the kind of blueprints you usually see when working with design or architecture.

### 10[**Dynamic Minimalism**](https://videohive.net/item/dynamic-minimalism-essential-graphics-mogrt/21637324?s%5Frank=16&%5Fga=2.111208772.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Sometimes, simple really is best!

## Part 2 **10 Best Text Motion After Effects**

Alright, now let's move on to our promised **Text Motion Graphics After Effects** and **Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro** templates. We've tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!

### 01[**Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal' by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you're confused, it's a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.

Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.

### 02[**Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title**](https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The next **text motion** template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title' also created by Mogrt. This one is **text motion graphics** that you can use for **Premiere Pro** and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It's a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!

As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as **text motion** for [after effects](https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt), it is available for that as well!

### 03[**Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro**](https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?%5Fga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text' graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we've provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that's just starting out and doesn't want anything too complicated.

### 04[**30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt**](https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?%5Fga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets' by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It's also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

### 05[**Comic Bubbles MOGRT**](https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?%5Fga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

### 06[**Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?%5Fga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal' is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the **text motion graphics** are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It's perfect for those looking for underwater-themed **text motion graphics**. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.

This is **Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro**. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.

### 07[**Text Messages Toolkit**](https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?%5Fga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit' might be a fun **text motion graphics** for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it's a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message' interactions. It's customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that's what you want.

### 08[**Large Text Title Block**](https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/)

With the ‘large text title block' template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you're wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!

### 09[**Blueprint Titles**](https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?%5Fga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want something that's a little quirkier? Or, perhaps, instructional? Then the ‘Blueprint Titles' template is one that you can consider. As you can perhaps guess from the name, it allows you to create **text motion graphics** in a style that is similar to the kind of blueprints you usually see when working with design or architecture.

### 10[**Dynamic Minimalism**](https://videohive.net/item/dynamic-minimalism-essential-graphics-mogrt/21637324?s%5Frank=16&%5Fga=2.111208772.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal' is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the **text motion graphics** are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal!

With the ‘large text title block' template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects.

With the increasing popularity of Smartphones, people these days are experiencing all new things with lots of excitement. And GIFs are always the most interesting content for them. When we talk about limited band width and fast loading time solutions then GIFs are the first options in front of our eyes. These files use to have small size so they can be transferred and downloaded with ease and at faster rate. If you are interested to know about various resizing concepts related to GIFs then the article below can be helpful for you.

## How to reduce GIF size?

There are so many things that contribute in managing overall size of GIFs. The list includes the colour count inside, dimensions of images that you have used for development of GIFs and number of frames included inside one GIF folder. In case if it is an animated GIF then size may increase accordingly. Somehow, if you become able to optimize your Gifs then it is much easier to share them over internet.

Photoshop is a great tool to edit your image, including gif images. Here we are going to show you how to make your GIF smaller in Photoshop.

 **1\. Crop away any extra space around the image:**

The very first task for users is to bring your GIF video file onto Photoshop timeline. Sometimes, it is not essential to update whole series of your GIF animation to the library, the GIF can be simply trimmed at timeline panel. One needs to turn on loop option and then be active enough to allocate the right place to trim your video.

 **2\. Reduce dimensions of Output:**

Those who are working on Photoshop CC 2017 version will be able to develop GIFs by simply executing Explore As option from menu. To do this, they need to move to files and then from drop down menu select Export as. Soon a menu will open where you need to choose your output file format as GIF and adjust weight and height parameter to reduce physical dimensions of your image.

In case if you are using Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 then on its interface, users need to move to File and then hit Save for Web option. It will help to open a Save for Web type dialogue box immediately, on this new window you can apply desired changes to physical dimensions of your content, reduce color information and apply dithering etc.

 **3\. Adjust number of colors in image:**

One of the most useful tricks for marketers is to optimize size of their GIF images by adjusting total number of colours to it. It can be done using color table tool that assists in easy selection and de-selection. This table use to contain about 256 unique colours and all of them use to contain 8 bit wide information. The best recommendation for good quality and small seize GIFs is to limit colours up to 64 only or keep then less than this. But sometimes your original videos may ask you for increment in color information.

 **Tips:**

During GIF size reduction process, you will have to go through color number selections in the series of 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 etc. Use the smaller side of scale to get best results during optimization process.

* Users can also reduce number of frames in their GIFs.
* Never forget to avoid dithering as it may help to improve appearance of images.
* It is essential work with loss less compression algorithms otherwise huge loss in information will be carried out.
* Interlacing is not good option for your GIFs as it causes significant increase in overall file size.
