Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.

Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:

Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.

**●** First, you draw the face but make sure you don't add a nose but do a black outline.

**●** Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don't use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.

**●** Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.

**●** Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-8.png)

**Step 2:** Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?

![how to draw your own cartoon character 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-9.png)

**Step 3:** Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png)

**Step 4:** Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-11.png)

**Step 5:** Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-12.png)

**Step 6:** Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-13.png)

**Step 7:** Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 07](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-14.png)

**Step 8:** You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 08](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-15.png)

**Step 9:** Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 09](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-16.png)

**Step 10:** You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-17.png)

![how to draw your own cartoon character 11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-18.png)

**Step 12:** You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-19.png)

**Step 13:** Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 13](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-20.png)
