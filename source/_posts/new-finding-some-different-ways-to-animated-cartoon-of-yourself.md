## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

## Part 3: FAQ about Animation Maker for Kids

### 1\. How do you make animations for kids?

Despite popular belief, it isn’t too difficult to find animation makers for kids. There are even tools out there that will let kids create their animations if they are old enough.

Children nowadays can create and develop their characters – and even dream up storylines to put a motion. The School Run has lots of exciting ideas on how children can get into animation themselves.

For adults, however, a good animation maker for kids can help us submit high-end projects on a low-end pay scale, providing you use the correct software.

### 2\. What is the best animation software for beginners?

Some best include Blender, Adobe Character Animator, and Filmora by Wondershare.

You can enter existing artwork or create new ones of your own in the virtual space, all of which can be done on a drag-and-drop basis.

### 3\. What is the easiest animation software to use?

The easiest animation maker for kids that you can use as software for your own projects has to be Filmora. As well as having a ton of free features, it gives you everything you need to mask, edit, animate, and evolve all of your details. You can use it to create art if you haven’t already got something planned – or you can use it to input any file type that you like.

It has some wonderful animation-making features that let you go from high-end and professional (like logo making) to fun and playful (like animation making). Best out of all of the features is that it is easy enough for children to understand how to do it.

## Conclusion

Creating a 2D animation video is a lot easier when you have the right software available to you. You already have a script and storyboard in mind, but now you can realize your vision in intricate and unique ways. Anyone of the products above will serve you well, but [FimoraPro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the one you should consider. Just download it now to have a try!
