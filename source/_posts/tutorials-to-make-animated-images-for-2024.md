When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly.

### 03**Adobe Creative Cloud Express**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Creative Bloq: 4/5\]

The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an **online photo animator** and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.

Photo Cartoon is an **online photo animator** that specifically alters your photos and ‘cartoon-izes’ it (with several effects to choose from as to the specific style that you want).

With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced **online photo animator** tools. This one works quite simply as well though.

The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an **online photo animator** and an application that you can download and install on your phone.

01 [Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons](#Part 1)

02 [Top 3 Resources to Get Free Animated GIF Icons](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

![photoshop export gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-9.jpg)

## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

![photoshop export gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-9.jpg)

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

### Method 2: Make Stunning Animated GIF Icons with Wondershare Filmora

Since Adobe Photoshop can be quite complicated to use, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora to create all kinds of animated GIF icons. It is a user-friendly media editing application that has a wide range of readily available assets and would also let you import files from your system.

Besides that, there are tons of stickers, visual elements, captions, animations, transitions, and so on that would let you create and customize funny GIF icons. Therefore, if you want to create animated GIF icons using Filmora, then you can simply follow these steps:

##### Step 1 Load Media Files (Images and Videos) on Filmora

To get things started, you can just launch Wondershare Filmora on your system and go to its File > Import menu to load media files to it. You can also drag and drop your media files directly to the interface of Filmora.

![ filmora load media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 Create or Edit GIFs on Wondershare Filmora

After loading your images or video clips, you can drag and drop them to the timeline at the bottom. In case you can want to get rid of any video clip, you can just hover the mouse around and use its trimming tool to meet your requirements.

![filmora trim gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif)

Once you have edited your videos or images, you can just go to their properties from the sidebar. From here, you can scale, reposition, rotate, flip, and perform other edits on your media files.

![filmora rotate image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/rotate-image-filmorax.jpg)

If you want to add texts to your GIFs, then just visit the “Titles” section of Filmora from the top. This will let you explore and include any caption effect that you can later edit on Filmora.

![filmora add titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles.jpg)

You can also go to the “Effects” section from the sidebar to explore a wide range of transitions, filters, stickers, and more that you can add to your GIFs.

##### Step 3 Export your Animated GIFs from Filmora

That’s it! Once you have worked on your funny GIF icons, you can get their preview, and click on the “Export” icon from the top. Here, you can select “GIF” as a target format and simply save them to a preferred location on your system.

![filmora save video as gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/saving-file-in-gif-format-in-filmora-x.jpg)

### Method 3: Take the Assistance of Canva to Create Animated GIFs

You might already know that Canva is already a popular online application that can be used to create social media posts, marketing video ads, brochures, GIFs, and more. Since Canva offers a wide range of assets (images, GIFs, and more), you can use it to create animated GIF icons on the go.

##### Step 1 Select a Template of your Choice on Canvas

Whenever you want to create a loading icon GIF, you can just go to your Canva account and look for any existing template. Apart from its existing template, you can also load a blank canvas.

![canva load gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-10.jpg)

##### Step 2 Use the Existing Designing Features of Canva

Great! Once you have opened your canvas, you can explore tons of assets on the side. For instance, you can add texts, borders, objects, and so on from the sidebar to your canvas. You can also select a relevant animation style and add it to your project.

![canva edit gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-11.jpg)

##### Step 3 Export the Media as a GIF from Canva

After working on the live GIF icon on Canva, you can just go to the Export option from the top and save it as a GIF on your system.

![canva export gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-12.jpg)
