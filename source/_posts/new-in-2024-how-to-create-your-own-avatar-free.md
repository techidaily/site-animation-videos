### 02**PicMonkey**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.4/5**\]**

When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.

### 01**Filmora**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Techradar: 4.5/5\]

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, while, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor, is the first **photo animation maker** on this list of ours. This software is highly-rated online and it comes with a bunch of presets, filters, and effects, that you can use in order to animate your photographs. Its more advanced video editing functions would no doubt prove to be useful in the future as well, allowing you to increase the complexity of your projects and achieve more and more things.

### 02**PicMonkey**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.4/5**\]**

When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.

### 03**Adobe Creative Cloud Express**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Creative Bloq: 4/5\]

The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an **online photo animator** and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.

**●** Comes with a veritable library of templates, effects, and filters for advanced photo editing and photo animation.

### 04**ColorCinch**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Crozdesk: 4/5\]

ColorCinch, or Cartoonize, as it is also called, is another popular **online photo animator** that you might have heard about already. This one features quite a few presets that you can use to quickly change the look of your photographs.

### 05**Photo Cartoon**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

Photo Cartoon is an **online photo animator** that specifically alters your photos and ‘cartoon-izes’ it (with several effects to choose from as to the specific style that you want). This single-use, while definitely not the most advanced on this list of ours, offers the user an easy way to change the look of their photographs.

**●** Transform photos into cartoons, paintings, drawings, and caricatures.

### 06**BeFunky**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.2/5\]

With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced **online photo animator** tools. This one works quite simply as well though. Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.

### 08**TheCartoonist.me**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A
