Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

### 4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)

Shiro, the creepy-looking girl from Deadman Wonderland is another character to be scared of. She was adopted for the only purpose of being used as a human experiment in her childhood. The experiments instilled a very scary character in her which gives a horror nature to the anime in total.

The experiments on here were very painful and multiple personalities called "The Wretched Egg" were developed by her to cope up with torture. The creepy nature and the use of her special skills to murder some characters in the anime and frame her adopted brother for it is very dark and scary.

![shiro-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-shiro-scary-anime.jpg)

### 5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)

Megumi Shimizu of Shiki is a young girl and the first of all to be killed by the Kirishiki family. She was the first person who died who was not Yamairi and also the first to rise as Shiki.

She also was ready to kill Tohru Mutou and Kaori’s father due to some small reasons. Her character without a drop of sympathy or care for the people around her is very scary and makes her very unpredictable.

![shiki-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-shiki-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)

Esdeath in Akame Ga Kill who is also known as the ice queen of the empire is a very manipulative character and a sadist. She follows the motto, the strong survive and the weak die, and justifies killing innocents and torturing enemies because of it.

Esdeath once made a prince who lost to strip naked before her and lick her boots, before killing his which is a different level of dark. She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.

![esdeath-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-esdeath-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)

Himiko is a cute-looking girl that possesses the ability to shapeshift to anything she wants. The creepy part is, in order to shapeshift she has to ingest another person’s blood.

![toga-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-toga-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)

Though Hana Midorikawa looks very cute and innocent she is as creepy as any girl can get. The story evolves in an underground prison school which is an explainable aspect that made Hana the sadist she is.

### 10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)

Lucy in Elfen Lied is a character that sometimes gets sympathy and other times creeps the audience out. She has difficulty drawing a line between good and evil. She can be seen as being sadistically tormented and ruthlessly tormenting about the cruelty around her.

Her surroundings and the people are responsible for how she is and that is why despite being creepy she is loved by a lot of people.

![lucy-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-lucy-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

Even though girls are usually displayed as cute and pinkish and lovely, some animes display them as creepy. And believe me, these creepy anime girls have a huge fan base and are capable of giving the audience a chill over the spine while watching them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

* [1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)](#part1)
* [2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)](#part2)
* [3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)](#part3)
* [4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)](#part4)
* [5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)](#part5)
* [6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)](#part6)
* [7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)](#part7)
* [8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)](#part8)
* [9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)](#part9)
* [10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)](#part10)

### 1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

There is too much to the story, and saying more about it may reveal the suspense. The story is filled with horror and adventure, and the character of Shion absorbs some of the darkness of the town, which gives a scary impact on the audience.

![higurashi-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-higurashi-scary-anime.jpg)

### 3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)

Sachiko from Corpse Party is a friendly-looking but scary character who loves to rip out the tongues of some of her fellow characters. She tortures students in Heavenly Host Elementry School which is a living hell in the anime.

Sachiko unleashes a lot of horror in the series and she plays the part of an elementary school ghost breaking all the expectations of the audience. Torturing her fellow mates and cutting their tongues out before death is something that makes Sachiko a perfect scary anime girl.

![corpse-party-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-corpse-party-scary-anime.jpg)

### 4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)

Shiro, the creepy-looking girl from Deadman Wonderland is another character to be scared of. She was adopted for the only purpose of being used as a human experiment in her childhood. The experiments instilled a very scary character in her which gives a horror nature to the anime in total.

The experiments on here were very painful and multiple personalities called "The Wretched Egg" were developed by her to cope up with torture. The creepy nature and the use of her special skills to murder some characters in the anime and frame her adopted brother for it is very dark and scary.

![shiro-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-shiro-scary-anime.jpg)

### 5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)

Megumi Shimizu of Shiki is a young girl and the first of all to be killed by the Kirishiki family. She was the first person who died who was not Yamairi and also the first to rise as Shiki.

After becoming a Shiki Megumi became very malicious and attacked the villagers. She enjoyed attacking them and that is very creepy. She also was ready to kill Tohru Mutou and Kaori’s father due to some small reasons. Her character without a drop of sympathy or care for the people around her is very scary and makes her very unpredictable.

![shiki-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-shiki-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)

Esdeath in Akame Ga Kill who is also known as the ice queen of the empire is a very manipulative character and a sadist. She follows the motto, the strong survive and the weak die, and justifies killing innocents and torturing enemies because of it.

Esdeath once made a prince who lost to strip naked before her and lick her boots, before killing his which is a different level of dark. She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.

![esdeath-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-esdeath-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)

Himiko is a cute-looking girl that possesses the ability to shapeshift to anything she wants. The creepy part is, in order to shapeshift she has to ingest another person’s blood.

Though Himiko appears to be a typical funny school girl, she can turn into a murderous beast in the blink of an eye. Her twister view of relationships and her trying to befriend people while trying to kill them at the same time all give us creepy chills while watching the anime.

![toga-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-toga-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)

Though Hana Midorikawa looks very cute and innocent she is as creepy as any girl can get. The story evolves in an underground prison school which is an explainable aspect that made Hana the sadist she is.

At first, Hana might seem to be a cute girl who does not belong at the place she currently is, but going deeper the opinion of the audience changes extremely. Hana happens to be a violent sociopath with a lot of dangerous thoughts and a urination fetish, and that is just the beginning of her creepiness.

![hana-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hana-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

**Colors:** Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.

**Dither:** The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.

**Lossy:** If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.

**Size:** Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.

#### Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file

 When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose "Save for Web" option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.

 It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop's animation based editing.

It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.

 Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.

 All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File > New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.

 Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have "Load Files into Stack" feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.

#### 2\.  Step 2

 Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.

 As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose "Make Frames from Layer" option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.

#### 3\.  Step 3

 Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.
