### 01Brush Tool

A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.

### 02Graphic Tablet

![How to Animate Pictures in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-2.jpg)

#### Step 1: Add Static Elements

Start by creating an image through static elements. To make the design attractive, you can add sample texts, illustrations, doodles, and other entities.

Try to stimulate your creativity and come up with a layout beforehand. If possible, sketch on paper and replicate the same.

#### Step 2: Animate Your Design

Take a final glance at the layout. Make sure it's perfect. Once all the elements are placed as per your design, it's time to animate them. For that:

* Click on the white background page
* Go to the "Toolbar" section
* Select the "Animate" button

#### Step 3: Select Page Animation Style

Canva offers six animation styles, where five are for free users, and one is for pro users. To access the five animation styles, follow these steps.

* Press the "Animate" Button
* Select "Page Animations"
* There you will find options like Block, Pan, Fade, Rise, and Tumble
* Select the style as per your design

#### Step 4: Preview and Download

After selecting a page animation style, it will preview the effect. If you find it good, move on to downloading the GIF. Here's how to do so

* Go to the "Toolbar" option (present on your upper right hand)
* Choose GIF as the file type
* Check the page number and verify if it's correct
* Press the "Done" button

#### Step 5: Final GIF

After clicking on the "Done" button, your GIF will be downloaded. You will be able to see a display for five seconds. If you want to edit the image after this, click on the time button (near the "Animate" button).

So, that was all about how to animate a photo in Canva.

### **Drawbacks of Canva**

Despite efficient features and easy interface, there are certain areas where Canva lacks. This includes

* It does not have any local file storage.
* As too many people use Canva, your template may look the same as others.
* Some of its best features are not free to access.
* The mobile app version lacks certain elements and features.

Out of all these drawbacks, repetitions of templates are a big issue. That's because everyone wants their posts to look unique and irreplaceable. However, common Canva templates may prevent that from happening.

Fortunately, there are ways to combat such issues. Let's learn about them in the next section.

# 10 Scary Anime Girls That Will Make You Creepy

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

Even though girls are usually displayed as cute and pinkish and lovely, some animes display them as creepy. And believe me, these creepy anime girls have a huge fan base and are capable of giving the audience a chill over the spine while watching them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

* [1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)](#part1)
* [2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)](#part2)
* [3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)](#part3)
* [4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)](#part4)
* [5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)](#part5)
* [6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)](#part6)
* [7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)](#part7)
* [8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)](#part8)
* [9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)](#part9)
* [10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)](#part10)

### 1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

![hell-girl-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hell-girl-scary-anime.jpg)

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

There is too much to the story, and saying more about it may reveal the suspense. The story is filled with horror and adventure, and the character of Shion absorbs some of the darkness of the town, which gives a scary impact on the audience.

![higurashi-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-higurashi-scary-anime.jpg)

### 3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)

Sachiko from Corpse Party is a friendly-looking but scary character who loves to rip out the tongues of some of her fellow characters. She tortures students in Heavenly Host Elementry School which is a living hell in the anime.

Sachiko unleashes a lot of horror in the series and she plays the part of an elementary school ghost breaking all the expectations of the audience. Torturing her fellow mates and cutting their tongues out before death is something that makes Sachiko a perfect scary anime girl.

![corpse-party-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-corpse-party-scary-anime.jpg)

### 4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)

Shiro, the creepy-looking girl from Deadman Wonderland is another character to be scared of. She was adopted for the only purpose of being used as a human experiment in her childhood. The experiments instilled a very scary character in her which gives a horror nature to the anime in total.

The experiments on here were very painful and multiple personalities called "The Wretched Egg" were developed by her to cope up with torture. The creepy nature and the use of her special skills to murder some characters in the anime and frame her adopted brother for it is very dark and scary.

![shiro-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-shiro-scary-anime.jpg)

### 5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)

Megumi Shimizu of Shiki is a young girl and the first of all to be killed by the Kirishiki family. She was the first person who died who was not Yamairi and also the first to rise as Shiki.

After becoming a Shiki Megumi became very malicious and attacked the villagers. She enjoyed attacking them and that is very creepy. She also was ready to kill Tohru Mutou and Kaori’s father due to some small reasons. Her character without a drop of sympathy or care for the people around her is very scary and makes her very unpredictable.

![shiki-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-shiki-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)

Esdeath in Akame Ga Kill who is also known as the ice queen of the empire is a very manipulative character and a sadist. She follows the motto, the strong survive and the weak die, and justifies killing innocents and torturing enemies because of it.

Esdeath once made a prince who lost to strip naked before her and lick her boots, before killing his which is a different level of dark. She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.

![esdeath-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-esdeath-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)

Himiko is a cute-looking girl that possesses the ability to shapeshift to anything she wants. The creepy part is, in order to shapeshift she has to ingest another person’s blood.

Though Himiko appears to be a typical funny school girl, she can turn into a murderous beast in the blink of an eye. Her twister view of relationships and her trying to befriend people while trying to kill them at the same time all give us creepy chills while watching the anime.

![toga-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-toga-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)

Though Hana Midorikawa looks very cute and innocent she is as creepy as any girl can get. The story evolves in an underground prison school which is an explainable aspect that made Hana the sadist she is.

At first, Hana might seem to be a cute girl who does not belong at the place she currently is, but going deeper the opinion of the audience changes extremely. Hana happens to be a violent sociopath with a lot of dangerous thoughts and a urination fetish, and that is just the beginning of her creepiness.

![hana-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hana-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)

Isabella who is also known as Mama is one of the main characters in the Promised Land. Being a caretaker to children, though she appears to be loving and affectionate to her children, that’s not the real case.

Isabella has a twisted character and shows detachment to her tragedies. This character shows antagonism, betrayal, and a twisted nature enough for the fans to feel creepy about her.

![isabella-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-isabella-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)

Lucy in Elfen Lied is a character that sometimes gets sympathy and other times creeps the audience out. She has difficulty drawing a line between good and evil. She can be seen as being sadistically tormented and ruthlessly tormenting about the cruelty around her.

Her surroundings and the people are responsible for how she is and that is why despite being creepy she is loved by a lot of people.

Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

Even though girls are usually displayed as cute and pinkish and lovely, some animes display them as creepy. And believe me, these creepy anime girls have a huge fan base and are capable of giving the audience a chill over the spine while watching them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

* [1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)](#part1)
* [2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)](#part2)
* [3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)](#part3)

### 1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

There is too much to the story, and saying more about it may reveal the suspense. The story is filled with horror and adventure, and the character of Shion absorbs some of the darkness of the town, which gives a scary impact on the audience.

### 3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)

### 4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)

Shiro, the creepy-looking girl from Deadman Wonderland is another character to be scared of. She was adopted for the only purpose of being used as a human experiment in her childhood. The experiments instilled a very scary character in her which gives a horror nature to the anime in total.

The experiments on here were very painful and multiple personalities called "The Wretched Egg" were developed by her to cope up with torture. The creepy nature and the use of her special skills to murder some characters in the anime and frame her adopted brother for it is very dark and scary.

![shiro-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-shiro-scary-anime.jpg)

### 5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)

Megumi Shimizu of Shiki is a young girl and the first of all to be killed by the Kirishiki family. She was the first person who died who was not Yamairi and also the first to rise as Shiki.

After becoming a Shiki Megumi became very malicious and attacked the villagers. She enjoyed attacking them and that is very creepy. She also was ready to kill Tohru Mutou and Kaori’s father due to some small reasons. Her character without a drop of sympathy or care for the people around her is very scary and makes her very unpredictable.

![shiki-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-shiki-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)

Esdeath in Akame Ga Kill who is also known as the ice queen of the empire is a very manipulative character and a sadist. She follows the motto, the strong survive and the weak die, and justifies killing innocents and torturing enemies because of it.

Esdeath once made a prince who lost to strip naked before her and lick her boots, before killing his which is a different level of dark. She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.

![esdeath-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-esdeath-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)

Himiko is a cute-looking girl that possesses the ability to shapeshift to anything she wants. The creepy part is, in order to shapeshift she has to ingest another person’s blood.

Though Himiko appears to be a typical funny school girl, she can turn into a murderous beast in the blink of an eye. Her twister view of relationships and her trying to befriend people while trying to kill them at the same time all give us creepy chills while watching the anime.

![toga-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-toga-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)

Though Hana Midorikawa looks very cute and innocent she is as creepy as any girl can get. The story evolves in an underground prison school which is an explainable aspect that made Hana the sadist she is.

At first, Hana might seem to be a cute girl who does not belong at the place she currently is, but going deeper the opinion of the audience changes extremely. Hana happens to be a violent sociopath with a lot of dangerous thoughts and a urination fetish, and that is just the beginning of her creepiness.

![hana-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hana-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)

Isabella who is also known as Mama is one of the main characters in the Promised Land. Being a caretaker to children, though she appears to be loving and affectionate to her children, that’s not the real case.

![isabella-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-isabella-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)

Lucy in Elfen Lied is a character that sometimes gets sympathy and other times creeps the audience out. She has difficulty drawing a line between good and evil. She can be seen as being sadistically tormented and ruthlessly tormenting about the cruelty around her.

Her surroundings and the people are responsible for how she is and that is why despite being creepy she is loved by a lot of people.

![lucy-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-lucy-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### Final thoughts
