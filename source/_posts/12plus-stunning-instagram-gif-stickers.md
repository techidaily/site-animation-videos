 Part 2 Dub an Anime Series with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Anime was initially created by the Japanese in their native language but as its viewership expanded globally, so did the need for it to be available in the universal language, i.e., English. Dubbing the original films or clips into another language is a complex process that demands skill. Nonetheless, worry not because editing apps like Wondershare Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are here to save the day with their easy and advanced editing tools.

How cool would it be to replace the original audio of an anime with your own voice? Exciting, right? You are in luck because the latest voiceover recording feature by Filmora is now available and ready to create your amazing and creatively dubbed videos in just a few easy steps.

**Step 1** Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and complete the setup.

![launch filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-on-windows-01.png)

**Step 2** Then, launch the application, tap the   **'import'** button under the menu, select **'Import Media Files'** and load the particular anime video to the media library.

![import anime video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-anime-video1.jpg)

**Step 3** Next, drag and drop the anime video onto the timeline. To add your own voiceover, you need to remove the original anime dubbing in the anime video first.

**Step 4** Right-click on the video, tap **'Detach Audio'**, and then delete the background audio from the track.

![detach anime video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-anime-video2.jpg)

![record anime video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-anime-video3.jpg)

![finish anime dubbing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dub-anime-video5.jpg)

You can double-click the audio track on the timeline to enhance it by adjusting the speed, duration, or pitch of the voiceover, or add fade in or fade out to better sync your voiceover to the anime.

**Step 8** Now, preview your creation, choose the file format of your choice, and hit **'Export'** to export the whole project to your computer or local devices. Or you can also upload it to YouTube or Vimeo directly.
