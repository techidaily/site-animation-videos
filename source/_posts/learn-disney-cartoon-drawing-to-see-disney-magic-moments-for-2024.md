### 02How to Draw Captain America

Follow these simple steps to make a Disney cartoon drawing of Captain America:

**Step 1**: Draw the head and chest

Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.

![draw the head and chest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-12.jpg)

**Step 2**: Draw his arm and waist

Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.

![sketch his waist and arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-13.jpg)

**Step 3**: Draw his legs

Here, we shall portray Captain America in action. Use curved lines to show his extended right leg with boots. The left leg should appear more petite.

![draw his legs in boots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-14.jpg)

**Step 4**: Draw his shield

Against his right arm, carefully draw a flattened circular shape. You can achieve this by drawing concentric circles with a large star in the middle. Draw his arm poking out from behind his shield.

**Step 1**: Draw a circle that would form Stitch's head

![draw a circle for its head](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-18.jpg)

### 02How to Draw Captain America

Follow these simple steps to make a Disney cartoon drawing of Captain America:

**Step 1**: Draw the head and chest

Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.

![draw the head and chest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-12.jpg)

**Step 2**: Draw his arm and waist

Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.

Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.

Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show.

In any case, the nostalgia factor is strong with this one The series has inspired many adaptations. And, with its revival on Disney XD in 2015, its popularity has only continued to grow

This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn't make it any less fun

**Summary:** While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), 'The Owl House' is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)

The story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.

## Part 3 History of Motion Graphics

Previously, before the presence of motion graphics in the world of technology the graphics worked just the images in the un-moving and flat formats.

Motion graphics first came into the scene when Oskar Fischinger and Norman McLaren were doing some experimental work. Later in 195some designers introduced motion graphics to the public in a bigger way. The designers later used in a few films that time and these films are still a great example of the motion graphics used at that time. Motion graphics in these films presented information such as the product company, actors, film directors, movie title, and many other things about the films in a very creative way.

Playing with the words or graphic elements was never seen by the people before the motion graphics. Later it’s started used in mostly all films and ad videos.

Now a day in the few years the advancement of animation software’s and the improvements in designs allowed people to learn more about motion graphics and try to produce new and eye-catching graphics.

## Part 4 Uses of Motion Graphics Today

Now a day due to the new technology every day the presence of the screen in multiple devices has extended the usage of motion graphics. **Motion graphics** are generally used in every device that has a screen such as opening the TV, introducing the information with the bumpers, and many other things. Below are a few examples where motion graphics are mainly used:

### 01Branding

Branding is the biggest channel and branding owners were looking for something different to refresh their brand and make it different from the other SKY channels. The Nerdo Creative Studio used motion graphics in their channel video and created a beautiful video with typography and text effects. This video makes it different from the other channels which generally people don’t see every day on television.

### 02Sharing Product Information Or Promotion Video

The main usage of motion graphics is promoting the products using the product videos created with the help of beautiful motion graphic backgrounds and texts. This helps brands to promote their products in front of customers in a clear way and get more sales. In the product videos, the **animated motion graphics** can help you a lot in creating entertaining, fun, and engaging eye-catching product videos.

### 03Telling a Story to the Audience

Storytelling about a brand or anything is a very complicated task because your story must be to the point and understandable by the viewers. In this case, motion graphics help a lot. For example, you can view the above video on the URL with clear images, text, icons, and great background music. This is a great concept and you can even use it for making ads for your products or for making short films.

### 04Explaining A Concept To Your Students Or In The Company Meetings

Motion graphics are a great way to make the explainer videos for your products or the new concepts to your students in the school or college. Motion graphic videos can more clearly explain the concepts to the audience instead of using a presentation. The YouTube video link above shows how beautifully the designer has explained the concept of blockchain in the video.

## Part 5 Motion Graphics vs. Animation: What’s the Difference?

Motion graphics are generally represented with moving images, text, and other objects and these graphics can easily display information with the help of moving objects such as the moving website logo, blurring text, bars in graphs, etc. Simply we can say the motion graphics can display the letters and shapes in the motion of the user’s choice. Sometimes things are very hard to explain with the still images whereas with the help of a few seconds of motion graphics you can clear everything perfectly.

If we talk about animation then this is a term under which motion graphics falls. Animation is used for more than 1years. So, we can say motion graphics are a part of animation itself. Any technique in the world which helps users to move static images or objects is known as animation. It can be Claymation, anime, cartoons, or motion graphics.

Mainly the content separates the motion graphics from the other types of animations because, in the motion graphic text, objects are associated with the other graphic designs.

![Text Motion Project with Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/why-these-10%2B-top-text-motion-templates-are-worth-your-attention1.png)

Have a look at the screenshot above that we included of an example project on the video editor, **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

## Part 2 **10 Best Text Motion After Effects**

Alright, now let's move on to our promised **Text Motion Graphics After Effects** and **Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro** templates. We've tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!

### 01[**Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal' by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you're confused, it's a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.

Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.

### 02[**Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title**](https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The next **text motion** template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title' also created by Mogrt. This one is **text motion graphics** that you can use for **Premiere Pro** and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It's a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!

As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as **text motion** for [after effects](https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt), it is available for that as well!

### 03[**Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro**](https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?%5Fga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text' graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we've provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that's just starting out and doesn't want anything too complicated.

### 04[**30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt**](https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?%5Fga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets' by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It's also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

### 05[**Comic Bubbles MOGRT**](https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?%5Fga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal' is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the **text motion graphics** are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal!

This is **Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro**. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.

### 07[**Text Messages Toolkit**](https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?%5Fga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

### 08[**Large Text Title Block**](https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/)

With the ‘large text title block' template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you're wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!

### 09[**Blueprint Titles**](https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?%5Fga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

## Part 2 **10 Best Text Motion After Effects**

Alright, now let's move on to our promised **Text Motion Graphics After Effects** and **Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro** templates. We've tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!

### 01[**Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal' by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you're confused, it's a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.

Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.

### 02[**Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title**](https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The next **text motion** template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title' also created by Mogrt. This one is **text motion graphics** that you can use for **Premiere Pro** and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It's a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!

As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as **text motion** for [after effects](https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt), it is available for that as well!

### 03[**Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro**](https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?%5Fga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text' graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we've provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that's just starting out and doesn't want anything too complicated.

### 04[**30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt**](https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?%5Fga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets' by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It's also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

### 05[**Comic Bubbles MOGRT**](https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?%5Fga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

### 06[**Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?%5Fga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal' is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the **text motion graphics** are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It's perfect for those looking for underwater-themed **text motion graphics**. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.

This is **Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro**. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.

### 07[**Text Messages Toolkit**](https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?%5Fga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit' might be a fun **text motion graphics** for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it's a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message' interactions. It's customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that's what you want.

### 08[**Large Text Title Block**](https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/)
