## Part 1  5 Best Places to Find Animated Christmas GIFs for Free

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

![pinterest christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-2.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

If you are looking for funny Christmas GIFs, then Giphy would be one of the best places to explore. It has some of the most extensive GIFs collections of all styles, including Christmas wishes GIFs.

Tenor is another clean and user-friendly website where you can find different types of funny Merry Christmas GIFs for free. You can look for stickers and GIFs by simply entering keywords of your choice on Tenor.

## Part 2 How to Create your Animated Christmas GIFs (with Music): A DIY Guide

Most of these readily available animated Christmas GIFs are quite generic and lack a customized appeal. Therefore, if you want to come up with some customized Christmas wishes GIFs, then consider using a dedicated editing tool like Wondershare Filmora.

You can explore and use the wide range of media assets of Filmora or import anything from your system. Besides that, tons of transitions, filters, captions, and other effects would let you come up with some customized Merry Christmas wishes GIFs via Filmora in the following way.

02 [How Do You Animate Games?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Draw 2d & 3d Characters for Video Games?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is 2D & 3D Animation Game?

Gaming animation is a blend of art and technology. It is one of those fields that require several technical skills. These are brilliant programming skills, understanding the basics of computer science, and practical technology know-how, collectively standing as the basic fundamental of Animation. Both 2D and 3D Animation changed the gaming experience forever and created an array of opportunities. But they differ in working and application.

### 01Working on 2D Animation

Flipbook can be a good example of the mechanism behind 2D Animation. After drawing a character or an object on the first page of a notebook, continue drawing for the next page and so on. Each removing should be a bit ahead or behind. When flipped swiftly, the series of drawings makes the character or object move.

The working of 2D Animation is not so different. But the detailing of the subject or the object cannot be minimal as a flipbook. 2D Animation demands more characters and more details while at the same time requiring smooth, visually appealing, and accurate detailing, which is a lot of pressure for the makers. Thanks to 2D making software, a week's work can be taken care of in minutes or two.

### 02Working on 3D Animation

The working mechanism of 3D Animation is more complicated than 2D. It is a layered process that requires several skills. It also involves "rigged" and animated 3D models. In 3D, the initial sketch of the entire subject and object is the first step towards the animation procedure. The second step is to make a 3D model of the intended animated object. It was third, texturing of the 3D animated object. Rigging is the final step; it gives the 3D model the power and ability to move. Once rigging is done, the character is already for posing. Drop it to the scene and start your Animation.

### 01Working on 2D Animation

Flipbook can be a good example of the mechanism behind 2D Animation. After drawing a character or an object on the first page of a notebook, continue drawing for the next page and so on. Each removing should be a bit ahead or behind. When flipped swiftly, the series of drawings makes the character or object move.

The working of 2D Animation is not so different.

In 3D, the initial sketch of the entire subject and object is the first step towards the animation procedure. The second step is to make a 3D model of the intended animated object. It was third, texturing of the 3D animated object. Rigging is the final step; it gives the 3D model the power and ability to move. Once rigging is done, the character is already for posing.

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

![erase and shade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-16.jpg)

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

Rigging is a technology that is not known to everyone. However, an animation freak must know the technology in depth.

![adobe animate rigging tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-00.jpg)

If you are an animator, you must be wondering how to implement rigging. Follow this tutorial and get a complete insight on the **adobe animate rigging tutorial**.

#### In this article

01 [Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?](#Part 2)

03 [Where to Rig and Animate More Characters?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?

The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.

![Rig Mapping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-01.jpg)

For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.

The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.

## Part 2 How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?

### 1\. How Do You Rig a 2d Character in an Animation?

❶ **Mango animate character animation maker**

Mango animate character animation maker is an amazing software that can perform the task of animation in a very simple manner. We can rightfully comment that the software does make the job of animators rather simple. The rigging animation software automatically generates an energetic skeletal figure of the static character image. Using this skeleton, the software helps you to animate the character.

❷ **Cartoon Animator 4**

The software is one that suffices to almost every level of animator, be it a novice, intermediate, or an expert. The animation maker has super cool features and could make you animate characters very easily.

![cartoon animator 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-04.jpg)

❸ **Blender**

### 2\. How Do You Animate a Custom Rig?

If you want to try animating custom rigs, it is indeed very simple, if you use beginner-friendly software, all you need to do is input the static image of your character. Select the motion template that you'd like to apply to your character. You're good to go! However, you can't animate custom motions using beginner-friendly software, you can only choose from the available templates.

03 [Where to Rig and Animate More Characters?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?

The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.

![Rig Mapping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-01.jpg)

For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.

The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.

## Part 2 How Do I Use Rig Mapping in Adobe Animate?

### 1\. How Do You Rig a 2d Character in an Animation?
