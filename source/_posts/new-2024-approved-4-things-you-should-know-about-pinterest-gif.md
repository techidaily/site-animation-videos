An anime name says a lot about the character and its personality. While creating anime names, animators aim to spot a light on the individuality of the character with connections to their past.

Anime names are full of style, strong sense, and unique sounds. These names are always cool; whether for girls or boys, they're used in adventurous, creative, and romantic anime series. All in all, **anime girl names** can be a true inspiration for anyone, regardless of gender

So, which anime girl name sounds perfect for your kid?
