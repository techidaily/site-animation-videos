## Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?

To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.

Let's say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.

## Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio

So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let's understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It's worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an **animated lower third in OBS** studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.

When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you'll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don't have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.

Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your **OBS animated lower-third** graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you'll end up losing potential viewers.

Here's a YouTube video that'll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.

## Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives
