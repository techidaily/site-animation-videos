Before getting though with the creation process, initiate a download of the slideshow creator program from the latter’s official website to any of your preferred Windows or iOS compatible devices.

**Step 2: Add Your Images and Videos**

Creating a slideshow presentation may require a set of multiple image and video files to the program’s graphic creator timeline. It is recommended to add your selections of the aforesaid files to a single folder before launching the software in your system.

Once you have finished making your selections, launch the program to reach its welcome interface, were you need to navigate and click on the ‘Media’ tab in the top toolbar. From the task options that appear, click on ‘Import a Media’. Next, you will be asked to browse through your device locations and choose the folder that contains your previously selected files to be used in the presentation you are about to create.

When you have found the required folder, tap on ‘OK’ to import the same to the new slideshow project in the Filmora timeline. All your selected files will be visible here after a successful import.

![Wondershare Filmora Animated Slideshow Creator- Media Import Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/12-animated-slideshow-powerpoint-templates-and-tools-to-make-them-14.JPG)

**Step 3: Timeline Positioning of Media Files**

Before working on the task of positioning the imported media files on the app’s timeline, navigate to the ‘File’ menu and choose the ‘Preferences’ option. As soon as the respective window pops up, reach to the ‘Editing’ tab at the top and select ‘Photo Placement’ from the drop down menu that follows.

In case your selected images do not have a matching aspect ratio with the program’s preset values, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option for removing the additional black bars from the selected images. For the requirement of adding camera pan and zoom movements to your images, select the ‘Pan & Zoom’ option in the ‘Preferences’ settings.

![Wondershare Filmora Animated Slideshow Creator- ‘Crop to Fit’ Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/12-animated-slideshow-powerpoint-templates-and-tools-to-make-them-15.JPG)

You can proceed to change the preset play durations of images, effects and transitions in the ‘Editing’ window itself. As an alternative you can adhere to the same task in the program’s timeline by dragging any one end of the media files in an outward or inward direction. The ‘Crop to Fit’ option may not give an affordable size in some cases where the images are set in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio. Choose the ‘Fit’ option to set this issue straight.

![Wondershare Filmora Animated Slideshow Creator- Image Play Duration
        Adjustment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/12-animated-slideshow-powerpoint-templates-and-tools-to-make-them-16.JPG)

When you have finished making all the aforesaid adjustments, navigate to the Media panel again for adding the selected image files to the software’s timeline. Proceed with selecting a file and dragging and dropping the same at the desired position within the timeline. Continue repeating the process till all the images have been placed at their respective locations, and in the exact order of appearance in the slideshow. This should be followed by adjusting the image play durations using any one of the previously described methods.

**Step 4: Escape Hard Cuts With Image Transitions**

Hard cuts among different slides of a presentation break the flow of the slideshow. To escape this cringe, consider using a smooth transition effect within the slides of your project. To do this, navigate to the ‘Transitions’ tab in the top toolbar of Filmora’s project window and select a desired one from over 100 choices of customizable transitions.

You can now drop these transitions in the timeline at the exact intersection point of two image files. Avoid using the same transition for every hard cut to escape monotony. You can instead choose different transitions for each slide while observing its appearance in the clip.

After you are done with applying transitions to each slide, double click on a particular transition to open its ‘Transition Setting Window’ either for presetting the transition play duration or to choose a desired transition mode. You can also prefer a direct customization of the transition duration in the project timeline through a right or left dragging of any of its ends.

**Step 5: Uplift Your Slideshow Colors With Overlays and Filters**

Navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Effects’ tab to choose from a diversity of visual effects that can be added to the slideshow images to supplement them with an increased vibrancy through color desaturation. These effects in the program’s library are categorized into classes of Overlays and Filters, with further subcategories of Sepia Tone, Light Leaks and Lomography and many more.

To apply these effects, just select and add them into a timeline track above the clip you wish to add the overlay or filter to. When you have applied the effects, observe the overall clip appearance in the ‘Preview Panel’. Double click on a particular effect to fine-tune the latter’s settings.

        Overlays](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/12-animated-slideshow-powerpoint-templates-and-tools-to-make-them-18.JPG)

**Step 6: Supplement Your Slides With Motion Graphic Elements**

While motion graphics will undoubtedly enhance your animated slideshows, adding them to your presentation is purely optional, since most professional projects do not need a motion graphic element to escalate their presentation outlook. If, however, you choose to work on making these a part of your animated slideshow, Filmora lets you do that in its ‘Elements’ tab.

There is a plethora of motion graphic templates that you can select and add to the project timeline for a quick and vibrant upgrade of your presentation slides, but, at the same time, it becomes important to take care of the visual outlook and the underlying reason of creating the slideshow before you decide on adding these elements to your project.

        Elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/12-animated-slideshow-powerpoint-templates-and-tools-to-make-them-19.JPG)

**Step 7: Create Voiceovers and Record Soundtracks for Your Slideshow**

Narration is a smart way to captivate the target audience within your slideshow, whether though a self-delivery or a recorded voiceover. If you decide on the second option, you can conveniently use the Filmora Slideshow Creator program to add voiceovers and soundtracks to your presentation.

To adhere to the purpose, navigate to the top toolbar and click on the ‘Media’ tab. From the options that appear, tap on the ‘Record’ menu that drops down, followed by selecting the ‘Record Voiceover’ option.

Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing **Unity character rigging** as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.

Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)

03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?

To understand what **Unity rigging** is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.

You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.

Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.

Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is **animation rigging in Unity**. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.

The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.

Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as **unity rigging**. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.

![what is unity rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-1.jpg)

## Part 2 Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?

Another platform that can ideally assist you in animation is Blender. A common question arises as to whether one should choose **blender rigging over Unity** or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.

| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |

| **Types Supported** | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |
| **Best Purpose**    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |

There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.

**●** Drawing

**●** Games

**●** In-Game Analytics

**●** Multi-player Gaming Network

**●** Player Management

**●** Virtual Reality

**●** IT Asset Management

**●** Prototype Creation

Therefore, it is preferred to opt for **Unity rigging** than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.

## Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity

Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in **unity rig animation**. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.

##### Step 1Installation

The first step is to install the "**animation rigging package" of Unity**. You will get the animation rigging package in the "Package Manager". You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.

This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called "runtime rigging".

The "Asset's Animator Root" consist of the "Rig Builder Component", which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create **Unity humanoid rig** that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.

![rig builder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-2.jpg)

##### Step 2Rig Builder set-up

After installing the **unity animation rigging package**, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the "Animator component" in this step. Using the "Animator component", integrate the "Rig Builder component" with the "GameObject". Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost "Transform".

Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the "Rig component". After this step, you need to access the "Animator root", where you will find the "Rig Builder component". In the "Rig Builder component", you need to assign the "Rig to the Rig Layers" list.

It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.

![rig builder set up unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-3.jpg)

##### Step 3Bone Rendering

Whether it is **unity rigging** or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The "Unity Editor" will help you interact and work with the character's skeleton in the "Scene view."

You can add "Transform" lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the "Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous "Bone Renderer" components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.

![bone rendering unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-4.jpg)

##### Step 4Adding Rig Effectors

This step enables one to add Gizmos to Transforms, facilitating selection and visualisation. The "Effector" are invisible during "Game View", and this step enhances the quality of the character animation.

![rig effects unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-5.jpg)

##### Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints

Your characters gain "runtime animation" through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.

![rig constraint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-6.jpg)

##### Step 6Working with the Two Bone IK Constraint

The first step here is to rest your character to the "Bind Pose." you can do so by opting for the "Menu Bar" and selecting the "Animation Rigging" option. You will find the "Bind Pose" option there, and you will have to click on it.

![bind pose unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-7.jpg)

Then add a child GameObject below "Character Rig". Then add a new child GameObject below "Right Arm IK". Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the "Right Arm Ik" by naming the first and the second one "RH IK Target" and "RH IK Hint", respectively.

![rh ik hint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-8.jpg)

Integrate the "Rig Builder Component" with the "Animator root GameObject". Then proceed with selecting the "CharecterRig GameObject" and integrating a "Rig Component". Select "Two Bone IK Contrainst" to the "Right Arm IK."

![rig component unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-9.jpg)

Then, incorporate a "Box Effector" to the RH IK Target. Integrate a "Ball Effector" to the "RH IK Hint".

![rh ik hint unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-10.jpg)

Then select the "RH IK Hint" and "Right Elbow". Select "Animation Rigging>align Transform". Move away from the "Ball Effector". Select the "Right Arm IK GameObject" and integrate the required bones. Integrate the Character Rig GameObkect with Rig Layer list by selecting the option of "Ninja". Then press "Play" and see your creation come to life.

02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)

03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?

To understand what **Unity rigging** is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.

You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.

Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.

Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is **animation rigging in Unity**. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.

The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.

Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as **unity rigging**. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.

## Part 2 Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?

Another platform that can ideally assist you in animation is Blender. A common question arises as to whether one should choose **blender rigging over Unity** or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.

| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |

| **Best Purpose**    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |

There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.

**●** Drawing

**●** Games

**●** In-Game Analytics

**●** Multi-player Gaming Network

**●** Player Management

**●** Virtual Reality

**●** IT Asset Management

**●** Prototype Creation

Therefore, it is preferred to opt for **Unity rigging** than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.

## Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity

Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in **unity rig animation**. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.

##### Step 1Installation

The first step is to install the "**animation rigging package" of Unity**. You will get the animation rigging package in the "Package Manager". You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.

This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called "runtime rigging".

The "Asset's Animator Root" consist of the "Rig Builder Component", which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create **Unity humanoid rig** that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.

![rig builder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-2.jpg)

##### Step 2Rig Builder set-up

After installing the **unity animation rigging package**, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the "Animator component" in this step. Using the "Animator component", integrate the "Rig Builder component" with the "GameObject". Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost "Transform".

Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the "Rig component". After this step, you need to access the "Animator root", where you will find the "Rig Builder component". In the "Rig Builder component", you need to assign the "Rig to the Rig Layers" list.

It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.

![rig builder set up unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-3.jpg)

##### Step 3Bone Rendering

Whether it is **unity rigging** or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The "Unity Editor" will help you interact and work with the character's skeleton in the "Scene view."

You can add "Transform" lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the "Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous "Bone Renderer" components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.

![bone rendering unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-4.jpg)

##### Step 4Adding Rig Effectors

This step enables one to add Gizmos to Transforms, facilitating selection and visualisation. The "Effector" are invisible during "Game View", and this step enhances the quality of the character animation.

![rig effects unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-5.jpg)

##### Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints

Your characters gain "runtime animation" through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.

![rig constraint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-6.jpg)

##### Step 6Working with the Two Bone IK Constraint

The first step here is to rest your character to the "Bind Pose." you can do so by opting for the "Menu Bar" and selecting the "Animation Rigging" option. You will find the "Bind Pose" option there, and you will have to click on it.

![bind pose unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-7.jpg)

Then add a child GameObject below "Character Rig". Then add a new child GameObject below "Right Arm IK". Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the "Right Arm Ik" by naming the first and the second one "RH IK Target" and "RH IK Hint", respectively.

![rh ik hint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-8.jpg)

Integrate the "Rig Builder Component" with the "Animator root GameObject". Then proceed with selecting the "CharecterRig GameObject" and integrating a "Rig Component". Select "Two Bone IK Contrainst" to the "Right Arm IK."

![rig component unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-9.jpg)

Then, incorporate a "Box Effector" to the RH IK Target. Integrate a "Ball Effector" to the "RH IK Hint".

![rh ik hint unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-10.jpg)

Then select the "RH IK Hint" and "Right Elbow". Select "Animation Rigging>align Transform". Move away from the "Ball Effector". Select the "Right Arm IK GameObject" and integrate the required bones. Integrate the Character Rig GameObkect with Rig Layer list by selecting the option of "Ninja". Then press "Play" and see your creation come to life.

## Part 1 Tips for Brilliant Cartoon Character Design

As a **cartoon character designer**, here are 10 tips you need to put in place to make a brilliant **cartoon character design**. They are;

**●** **Do not lose the magic**

Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.

The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.

![cartoon character design tips 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cartoon-character-design-2.jpg)

**●** **Avoid reference material**

Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn't have the reference material right in front of you as you work.

Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.

**●** **Make research on other characters**

For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.

**●** **Also, take a look elsewhere**

It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character's posture or idea's movement.

**●** **Try not to lose sight of the original idea**

It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.

**●** **Exaggerate**

When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters' essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.

**●** **Decide the aim of your character design**

When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your 'thing.' Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.

**●** **Make your character distinctive**

Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people's attention.

**●** **Create clear silhouettes**

A silhouette is required to help you understand the character's gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character 'reads' and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.

**●**   **Consider line quality**

Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.

## Part 1 Tips for Brilliant Cartoon Character Design

As a **cartoon character designer**, here are 10 tips you need to put in place to make a brilliant **cartoon character design**. They are;

**●** **Do not lose the magic**

Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.

The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.

**●** **Avoid reference material**

Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn't have the reference material right in front of you as you work.

Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.

**●** **Make research on other characters**

For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.

**●** **Also, take a look elsewhere**

It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character's posture or idea's movement.

**●** **Try not to lose sight of the original idea**

It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.

**●** **Exaggerate**

When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters' essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.

**●** **Decide the aim of your character design**

When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your 'thing.' Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.

**●** **Make your character distinctive**

Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people's attention.

**●** **Create clear silhouettes**

A silhouette is required to help you understand the character's gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character 'reads' and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.

**●**   **Consider line quality**

Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.
