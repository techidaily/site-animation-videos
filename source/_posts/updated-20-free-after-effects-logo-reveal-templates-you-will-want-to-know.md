For those who want more than the usual robotic text-to-speech AI that you see in more professional software. Learn more about all this below, we've prepared an entire guide for you!

#### In this article

01 [What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for Youtube](#Part 2)

03 [How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

![Natural Readers - Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers4.png)

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

![Cepstral Voices - Demo Voices Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers7.png)

## Part 4 **Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech**

Now, onto some more **anime text-to-speech** options that you can try in order to make your text-to-speech script sound exactly like your favorite cartoon or anime characters! For this list, we've not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:

### 01Flixier

Flixier is the first **anime text-to-speech** maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

![Woord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers9.png)

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you're really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.

### 05TTS Reader

TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon/anime characters. It doesn't have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you're looking for is something easy to use.

04 [Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

![Natural Readers - Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers4.png)

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

## Part 4 **Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech**

Now, onto some more **anime text-to-speech** options that you can try in order to make your text-to-speech script sound exactly like your favorite cartoon or anime characters! For this list, we've not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:

### 01Flixier

Flixier is the first **anime text-to-speech** maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

**●** It comes with advanced team functionalities.

![Flixier Online Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers8.png)

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

![Woord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers9.png)

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

![Speechelo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers10.png)

### 04Cartoon Animator 4

Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you're really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.

**●** Free-to-use **text-to-speech anime character**

**●** Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.

**●** A wide variety of voice options to choose from.

![Cartoon Animator 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers11.png)

### 05TTS Reader

TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon/anime characters. It doesn't have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you're looking for is something easy to use.

**●** Available to use online for FREE.

**●** Variety of different voice options.

**●** Adjustable speed for voice.

![TTS Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers12.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** If you're looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it's important that you're aware of all the different options out there!

**●** Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you'll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.

**●** In the end, you'll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.

## How to Create a Whiteboard Animation Video

Whiteboard animation simply refers to the process of story telling using pictures and drawn resources on a whiteboard or a plane white surface. Its simply the creation of conventional story telling procedure where text, images, diagrams, figures, etc are drawn onto a white surface.

Whiteboard animation video usually work with audio, visual and most times a combination of both audio and visual to sell a particular information to the audience. Another name it has gotten over time which you may come across while surfing the internet is doodle videos.

![whiteboard animation video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/whiteboard-animation-video.jpg)

In creating this type of videos, script writes are usually employed because of the dynamics involved in creating them. The major users of whiteboard animation video are business owners and people in the education fields. Other people make use of it but these two groups are the major users.

Whiteboard animation is important because it helps viewers remember the contents of what they watched better than looking at an image that contains a lot of information that may not always be organized.

Over time, whiteboard videos have become a more compelling and innovative method of dissemination information. They work so well because it's a more relatable and fun way of making videos. It goes outside the conventional video making techniques and employs the animation standards which is fun to watch, engaging and still maintains the ability to effective pass the required information to the viewers.

Also, it uses a unique style to mix text, animations, and colors to drive the point home. Viewers are usually glued to their screen while watching it. The usual white background equally makes the information being displayed to effective contrast with each other. However, there is a recent movement from the usual white background to any color of choice while still maintaining the contrasting quality of the videos.

Finally, people tend to remember events or information if they are told as stories. This is one of the major objectives of whiteboard animation videos. They use graphics and animations to tell stories, sell products and services while maintaining the fun in it.

Whiteboard animation video usually takes time to create. Its not always as easy as it may seem. It takes dedication and patience before you perfect the video. if you're new to this, its ok to not have that perfect video immediately. What matters is your will to grow and get better.

Below is an example of a whiteboard animation video created using Animaker. We'll still look at the various software applications used for creating whiteboard animation videos.

1. [Filmora](#part2-1)
2. [Animaker](#part2-2)
3. [Doodly](#part2-3)

## How to Create Your Video

Step1 The first step to creating your whiteboard animation video is to **know your topic of choice**. Determining your choice topic is based on the purpose of the video. You have to know the reason why the video is being created in the first place to enable you decide the contents, the outlook, the font style and size and the colors to use.

Step2 The next step after you've getting your topic is execution of the idea. This involves having a script which usually involves the step-by-step procedure you are to follow to achieve your goal. Writing the script is arguable the most difficult process. However, once you get it right, all the other processes become relatively easy to execute. You might need to employ a professional script writer depending on your budget for the project.

Step3 After that, the next thing is to deicide whether or not to use your own voice or computer voice. This is also called a voice over. Most software provides a text to speech voice over option which usually comes with various alternatives. There is also another option of using your own voice to finish the project.

Step4 Add text, graphics and animation. This step is usually easier when you are working with the script already provided. You include the text, animations, figures, etc. sometimes you might need to import additional resources to complete this task. However, not all software provides for this.

Step5 Organize your work. In organizing your work, you must ensure that you voice over matches properly with what is on display. Check your spellings, grammar, composition and other ‘little' details that may give your work a bad look.

**Step 6: Using the Channels Panel**

The next step is to select and copy your portrait using the ‘Ctrl + A’ and Ctrl + C commands respectively. Navigate to the ‘Channels’ panel at the right of the Photoshop workspace. At the panel’s bottom right, proceed with creating a new channel. It will be assigned the name ‘Alpha 1’ by Photoshop, which you are most welcome to change.

**Step 7: Color Inversion**

When you finish creating the channel, use the ‘Ctrl + V’ command to paste your portrait in the same. Proceed with inverting the image colors by navigating to the ‘Image’ option, followed by choosing the ‘Adjustment’ and ‘Invert’ options from the consecutive drop downs. Now, make a selection of the ‘White’ regions of your portrait by pressing the ‘Ctrl’ key and clicking on the ‘Alpha 1 Channel thumbnail.

**Step 8: Layer Creation**

Navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel at the right of the Photoshop workspace, and click on the ‘New Layer’ icon for creating a fresh layer. Fill the just created layer with black color, either by pressing ‘g’ from your system’s keyboard, or using the ‘Paint Bucket’ tool. Don’t forget to assign a suitable name to the layer.

Repeat the above process to create a separate layer and e fill the same with white color. The layer creation process is essential to separate the white and black colors of the actual image.

In the ‘Layers’ panel, drag the ‘Black’ layer above the ‘White’ one.

**Step 11: Creating Additional Layers**

You are now required to create three more layers, with the same process as for the above two, for adding effects to the Skin, Clothes and Teeth/Eyes of the portrait. When you finish creation, assign suitable names to the layers, followed by dragging them below the ‘Black’ one within the ‘Layers’ panel.

**Step 12: Color Selection and Application**

Choose the respective colors for the clothes, skin and teeth/eyes of the cartoonized edit. To proceed with color application, navigate to the toolbar at the left of the Photoshop workspace and choose the ‘Brush Tool’. Finally, choose a particular layer and apply careful brush strokes to add color to the specific area of the portrait that you wish to edit. Follow the same process to add colors to the remaining layers to get the desired result in all areas of your cartoonized edit.

**Step 13: Using the Gradient Tool**

Navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel again and create a new ‘Gradient’ layer to further enhance your creation. You now need to select the ‘Gradient Tool’ from the toolbar at the left of the Photoshop workspace. The ‘Gradient Editor’ pops up with the continuously running ‘Gradient Bar’, as soon as you make the selection. Double click on the gradient boxes at both ends to select them, followed by making your color choices. Tap on ‘OK’ when you are satisfied with your work.

**Step 14: Filling the Gradients**

To proceed with gradient filling, press and hold the mouse button on the image at the bottom left and continue to drag the cursor to its top right corner. Leave the mouse and navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel for dragging and dropping the ‘Gradient’ layer above the ‘White’ layer.
