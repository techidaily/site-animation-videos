**●** Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.

**●** Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.

**●** Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.

**●** Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called "Repousse". By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space

**●** Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.

### 02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life

**3D motion photo animator**

The first tool on the list of **3d photo animators online**is an excellent tool called 3D motion photo Animator. The tool helps to split landscape shots into numerous panels depending on the distance of the object from the camera. Furthermore, the plug-in also adds a soft parallax movement into the layers, giving the final image a beautiful 3D effect. The tool also has several editing options and a wide range of lens flare. The animator tool allows you to tweak the weather by using the weather effect options available in the tool.

**3D photo animator**

This **3d animation photo maker online** takes the hype of the parallax effect in animation to a whole different level. The animator allows you to add parallax effects to any still image to make it appear 3 dimensional. Moreover, you can also add depth to the animated image to enhance the 3 dimensional effects and make it appear more realistic.

**Live photo animation**

Live photo animation is another seamless tool that offers **free 3d motion graphics**. The tool which is mainly meant for animation gives you the ability to mask the object and a keyframe from vivid natural movements. Once the subject and the background have been isolated and processed, they work independently from each other. This means that, due to independent operation, live photo animation becomes even more realistic since the subject can be animated without affecting the background. The tool also has cool zooming and 3D tracking effects.

**Easy 3D face photo Animator**

Most tools for **3d photo animation online** fail to make the image look completely 3 dimensional. Even after the animation is performed, the people and the objects continue to look 2 dimensional. However easy 3D face photo Animator solves the problem. Using this tool, you can individually animate a face and make it 3 dimensional. It uses several panels to recreate the effect that'd be provided by a video recorder.

**Live photo Animator**

Looking for an animating tool to animate still images and transform them into stunning videos like action pictures? Live photo Animator is just the perfect tool for you then. The tool has a simple interface and helps generate realistic 3d action images. The plug-in works on the principle of duplicating action elements in an image. These action images include water, dust, fire, and other different kinds of moving objects in an image.

**Photo Animator tool**

The photo Animator tool kit is a great tool to generate animated 3D images. This quick time-saving tool is your go-to tool for photo effects and zooming. Moreover, the pack also consists of 50 preset animation templates that you can choose from. All you need to do is drag and drop the still images into the tool, and then you need to select the template that you'd like to apply to the image. The tool then processes the image and animates it to convert the still image into a 3d one.

**Media animator**

Think of smooth and seamless media transitions? Media animator is the perfect tool for you. This software offers a set of seamless and dynamically animated media transitions. The smooth transition effects make the images produced by this tool perfect for using the 3D animations in your official presentations and slideshows.

**3D photo Animator**

Have an attractive image that you wish to enhance by using animation? Here's a simple software that can help you add a touch of flair to any simple image. The software has amazing 3d animation powers. When you zoom on the images produced by the software, the entire perspective changes, and the image looks entirely 3D.

**Particular photo animation**

The animating tool is the best for those who wish to finish animation quickly. The software has an amazing and stylish way of making slideshows. The tool has several templates that concentrate on the particular motion.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** **3d animation** is one of the most budding fields these days. It makes our photos life-like and brings back real life memories.

**●** Using 3D animation, still images are brought back to life and memories from years back are revived.

**●** We looked at a few of the best tools for animating an image and converting them to 3D. 3D images can also help make your project reports and presentations much more attractive and earn you the extra edge over your colleagues.

## Part 1 What is 3D Image Animate?

3D Image Animate is making a moving scene using just a simple image. It is quite a complicated process and requires high technical skills to achieve a moving animation out of a still image. For your convenience, here we list some of the examples that will make you understand what 3D Image Animate is.

### 01Resuscitate a Person or Object

This first 3D Image Animate example depicts turning a real-life still image of a person and making him move out of that still image. Sounds absurd, right? Well, just look at this example below.

### 02Pan View of Car

Motion graphics has bought an ultimate change in the sectors of creative industries. In this guide you will get to know the various **types of motion graphics** and some examples of the same.

#### In this article

01 [What are Motion Graphics?](#Part 1)

02 [15 Types of Motion Graphics You Should Know](#Part 2)

03 [8 Stunning Motion Graphic Examples](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What are Motion Graphics?

### 01Definition of Motion Graphics

Motion graphics simples means that graphics which are in motion or movement. In other words, you can say that such graphics create an illusion of movement on the screen and most commonly they are combined with various audios for different purposes of multimedia. Although motion graphics are not like animations as here are some limitations of producing the content.

![definition of motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learning-motion-graphics-1.jpg)

### 02Motion Graphics vs. Video: is there a Difference?

You can say that every graphic motion is a video. To understand this you will need to know the applications of motion graphics and videos. Here mentioned are some of them:

**●** If you are creating something in the format of animation then it can done via motion graphics and videos too.

**●** When you are making a live action video then that could not be created in motion graphics but in the video format.

**●** Although if you are creating live action videos with animation overlay then you can use motion graphics as well as video formats too.

**●** Next is the slideshow video format, here the images and videos can be created in slideshow using both motion graphics and videos.

![which one is better: videos or motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learning-motion-graphics-2.jpg)

### 03When to Use Motion Graphics and Video?
