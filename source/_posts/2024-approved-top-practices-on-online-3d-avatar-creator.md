### 9\. Doukyusei

Doukyusei tells us about a carefree boy who is part of a band. Being always focused on what's happening now, he and his entire class are forced to partake in an upcoming chorus festival. Coincidentally he meets one of his classmates who is well known for his brilliance. He sees him practicing alone and failing woefully to get their class song right. Happy to see the brilliant student in need of help, he decides to help his new friend achieve his aim and prepare for the upcoming event. This is not your conventional anime romance movie because it tells a story of two boys and their 'love' for each other.

### 10\. 5 Centimeters Per Second

This film tells us the story of a young boy who gets the chance to befriend a new girl who was just transferred to his school. We are taken through their genuine friendship which came as a result of their taste and interests being the same. They soon develop strong feelings for each other and their bond is shown when they both speak to each other using their names only. They later go separate ways in a bid to further their studies but while apart they could still communicate deeply. They go on to meet different partners and even have children but their connection remained intact.

This short series shows us just how amazing the human heart can be when deeply attached to another.
