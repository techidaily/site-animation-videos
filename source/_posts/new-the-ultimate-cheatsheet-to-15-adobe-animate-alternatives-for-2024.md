## Part 1 Adobe Animate - How It Became a Good Option Without Hesitation?

### 1\. How Much Do You Know About Adobe Animate Key Features?

The Adobe Creative Cloud is constantly updating its range of virtual tools with new features which give users twice more incentive to subscribe. Adobe Animate CC, which is basically the new Adobe Flash, has also received an update recently which installed a bundle of new features to its interface, making it even more irresistible to animators.

**What's new with Adobe Animate?**

**●** **Audio Syncing**

Adobe Animate enables you to synchronize audio to your animations completely easily which is yet another feature that has been recently added.

Though it resembles the same functionality with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate has renewed the tool with the ability to use tilt and pressure effects when drawing with a stylus or pen.

**●** **Web Fonts**

Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.

The Adobe Creative Cloud is constantly updating its range of virtual tools with new features which give users twice more incentive to subscribe. Adobe Animate CC, which is basically the new Adobe Flash, has also received an update recently which installed a bundle of new features to its interface, making it even more irresistible to animators.

**What's new with Adobe Animate?**

**●** **Adobe Animate Camera**

Adding to Adobe's line of exclusivity is its all-new Adobe Virtual Camera. Using this feature, Adobe animate users can now control their animation camera movements giving your animation videos a more realistic feel.

**●** **Export any Format**

Exporting your animations to your desktop is a convenience every software should provide.

**●** **Audio Syncing**

Adobe Animate enables you to synchronize audio to your animations completely easily which is yet another feature that has been recently added.

**●** **Vector Brushes**

Though it resembles the same functionality with Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate has renewed the tool with the ability to use tilt and pressure effects when drawing with a stylus or pen.

**●** **Web Fonts**

Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.

## Is Blender 2D Animation As Awesome As 3D?

Blender is a widely popular animation tool that designers primarily use to create 3D animations. It offers a full-scale editing panel and a plethora of features that allow designers to create visually enticing 3D animations for videos, games, and marketing purposes. But, can you use Blender to create 2D animations? Even though the tool is marketed as a 3D animation creator, it's worth noting that one can use it for 2D animations as well. Now, the process may not be as straightforward as using a dedicated 2D animation creator, you can still get the job done using Blender. This will be pretty helpful if you are already a Blender user and want to create 2D animations for a project.

![file new blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-1.jpg)

##### Step 2

Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.

![design image blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-2.jpg)

##### Step 3

The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.

##### Step 4

After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.

![array modifier blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-3.jpg)

##### Step 5

Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you've drawn on the screen and then, select "Rotation and Scale". A separate editing window will pop up on your screen. Here you can customize the movement of the object by changing its scaling options through keyframing.

That's it; your 2D animation is now ready and you can save it on your computer.
