## Part 1  5 Best Places to Find Animated Christmas GIFs for Free

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

![pinterest christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-2.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

If you are looking for funny Christmas GIFs, then Giphy would be one of the best places to explore. It has some of the most extensive GIFs collections of all styles, including Christmas wishes GIFs.

You can head to the website of Giphy or use its mobile application to find all sorts of animated Christmas GIFs as per your needs. There are tons of stickers, animated stories, and funny GIFs related to pop cultures that you would also find on Giphy.

### 3\. Tenor

Tenor is another clean and user-friendly website where you can find different types of funny Merry Christmas GIFs for free. You can look for stickers and GIFs by simply entering keywords of your choice on Tenor.

Once you load an animated Christmas GIF, you can save it offline or generate its shareable link. In this way, you can directly share the Merry Christmas wishes GIF to your loved ones on platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, and so on.

![tenor christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-4.jpg)

### 4\. GyfCat

Having thousands of anime Christmas GIFs, GyfCat is another popular online source that you should check out. Most of the free Christmas GIFs here are animated or related to pop culture videos.

You can enter multiple keywords and hashtags on the search bar of GyfCat to find specific Christmas wishes GIFs. Most of the results here are ideal for funny Xmas GIFs that are bound to make your friends and family smile.

### 5\. Funimada

From elves to Santa Claus and reindeers to fireworks, you can find funny Christmas GIFs of all kinds in Funimada. Unlike other places, Funimada has a curated list of animated Christmas GIFs that you can explore on its website.

Once you find a perfect anime Christmas GIF at Funimada, you can download it on your device or system and share it with others however you like.

## Part 2 How to Create your Animated Christmas GIFs (with Music): A DIY Guide

Most of these readily available animated Christmas GIFs are quite generic and lack a customized appeal. Therefore, if you want to come up with some customized Christmas wishes GIFs, then consider using a dedicated editing tool like Wondershare Filmora.

Since it is a user-friendly video and media editing tool, you won’t encounter issues working on an animated Christmas GIF. You can explore and use the wide range of media assets of Filmora or import anything from your system. Besides that, tons of transitions, filters, captions, and other effects would let you come up with some customized Merry Christmas wishes GIFs via Filmora in the following way.

##### Step 1 Load the Media Files of your Choice on Filmora

You can start by installing Wondershare Filmora on your system and launch it whenever you want to work on any animated Christmas GIF. Afterward, you can drag and drop your media files to it or go to its Menu > File > Import Media to browse and load your files.

##### Step2 Create your Animated Christmas GIFs with Filmora

Great! Once you have loaded your media files, you can drag and drop them to the timeline at the bottom to start editing them. If you want to clip out any unwanted parts from a video, then hover the mouse at the end. This will let you use its trimming tool to clip out any part of the file.

![ filmora trim gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif)

There are tons of other editing options that are available on Filmora. For instance, once you select a video, you can go to its properties to apply all sorts of transformations such as rotation, flipping, scaling, repositioning, and so on.

![ filmora rotate gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/rotate-image-filmorax.jpg)

Many people would like to add captions to their animated Christmas GIFs to wish others personally. You can do the same by visiting the “Titles” section of Filmora and exploring different styles of caption effects. You can drag and drop any caption effect and add your text here to customize it.

![ filmora add titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles.jpg)

To further improve the visual appeal of your Christmas wishes GIF, you can explore and apply tons of transitions, filters, overlays, and other effects that are available in Filmora.

![filmora filters for videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

If you want to add music to your Merry Christmas wishes GIF, you can add any soundtrack to your project. You can also go to the “Audio” section of Filmora, where you can browse several sound effects and drag and drop your media files. If you want, you can also record voiceovers for your videos using the native feature on Filmora.

![filmora sound effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/select-theme-music.jpg)

##### Step 3 Export your Christmas Wishes GIFs from Filmora

Lastly, you can get a preview of your funny Merry Christmas GIF on Filmora and can click on the “Export” button to save it. Here, you can select a preferred format (like GIF or MP4) in which you want to keep your media file on your system. If you have included music in your project, consider exporting it as an MP4 file instead of a GIF.
