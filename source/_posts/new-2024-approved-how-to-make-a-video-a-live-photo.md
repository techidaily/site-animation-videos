## Part 1 What is an Animated Sticky Navbar?

To put it in simple words, an **animated sticky navbar** is a dedicated header that stays fixed on the website, irrespective of the web page you're accessing. Ideally, designers use a sticky navbar to allow website visitors to visit any web page within 2-3 clicks.

The **animated navbar** also incorporates a few animations that uplift the overall visual appearance of the website. It doesn't matter if you are planning to design an e-commerce store or a simple service-based website, the animated navbar will allow you to make your website more user-friendly for the end-users.

## Part 2 What Are the Benefits of An Animated Sticky Navbar?

Now, there are endless benefits of using an **animated sticky navbar** on your website. However, these are a few factors that make **animated sticky navbars** the most useful on-page element of a website.

### 01Quick Navigation

As we mentioned earlier, easy navigation is one of the key features of a sticky navbar. You can place links to all the other web pages within the navbar in the form of drop-down menus and ensure that users can visit any webpage within a single click. This will enhance the overall user experience and you'll be able to encourage one-time visitors to spend more time on your website. Using the navbar will also improve your search engine rankings because the search engine crawler will be able to crawl all the web pages easily.

### 02Aesthetically Pleasing

The way your website looks has a huge impact on whether you're going to retain the website visitors or not. An **animated sticky navbar** will make your website look aesthetically pleasing and captivate the visitors more effectively. You can add different animations and visual elements to the navbar and make them match your website's overall color scheme.

### 03Better User Experience

Another reason why you would want to place an **animated sticky navbar** on your website is that it'll uplift the overall user experience for the website visitors. From finding easy navigation to all the web pages to ensuring that all the web pages offer the same browsing experience, a navbar will make your website engaging and it'll become easier to captivate the users.

### 02AirBnB

Moreover, the navbar has links to all the Adobe products, which means users can visit any product page they want right away. It's also worth understanding that Adobe has added a dedicated “Sign-in” button in the navigation bar to allow visitors to sign in to the Adobe cloud account straightaway.

### 05Daniel Filler

Daniel Filler's website uses the navigation bar in the simplest way possible - yet manages to draw the viewers' attention without any hassle. The designers have placed a pretty small navigation bar with links to all the important web pages.
