## Part 1 Let's Figure out What's Anime Filter First

### 01What is the Anime Filter on TikTok?

Okay, first off What even is this **anime filter** everyone is talking about and how can you use it to **turn yourself into an animated character**? We've attached a helpful YouTube Video below from @Kapwing who has a more comprehensive explanation for you.

But, as for the basics? It works just like most filters in that it can be used in both video and picture mode (allowing you to also **make your own animated profile picture** if you'd like). All you have to do is turn it on, and it'll turn you into the most fitting anime character of your style immediately

### 02How to Get the TikTok Anime Filter?

Now to finally get down to business How exactly can you get the **anime filter** for your TikTok? Well, here's the trick Despite having earned its popularity on TikTok, the **Anime Style** filter actually comes from Snapchat So, if you do want to animate yourself like you've seen all the other popular TikTok-ers do, you'll need to record the video (or take the picture) on the Snapchat App first and then upload it to TikTok.

### 03A step-by-step breakdown of this process has been provided below (pictures included)

##### Step 1Download the Snapchat App

Alright, to start off with, you'll need to download the Snapchat app on your smartphone (it's available for both Android and iOS devices)

![Download the Snapchat App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-01.jpg)

##### Step 3Search for the Anime Style Filter on Snapchat

Once you have the Snapchat app open, click on the search bar at the top of the interface, type ‘anime style', and search

You might find that there are multiple versions of the filter (like as is shown in the image below), but the one that you need to select is the one titled Anime Style and created by Snapchat (it should appear first, as it does in the example)

![Look for the Anime Style filter on Snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-03.jpg)

##### Step 4Turn Yourself into an Animated Character

Finally You should be moved to the video recorder or the profile picture taker, where you can see yourself animated once and for all

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

### 0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character

**Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg)

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.

Works with most skin tones.

Better hair/accessory integration.

##### Cons

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

**Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-07.jpg)

Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called **Cartoon Style** This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo & Stitch, etc.), but it doesn't make it any less fun

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens.

Works with all skin tones.

Works with accessories.

##### Cons

More of a cartoon animated style than anime.

Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.

Not great at capturing motion.

Again, just like the Anime Filter, this is good for slapping on just to have fun or to sneakily erase a couple of blemishes

**Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter**

![Anime Filter from TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-08.jpg)

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

Not the best with skin tones.

It doesn't use the classic Japanese-animation style.

The first step, of course, is to go to the app store on your mobile device.

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

## Part 1 **How to Draw Cartoon Characters Step by Step**

Note that in the world we live in, Professionals were once students, and experts were once beginners. This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: "learning."

![how to draw cartoons characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

Step 1:

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**Step 7:** Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

![how to draw with colour 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-6.jpg)

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

**Cartoon character drawing** is usually a vital aspect of any child's life who loves to watch cartoon series and can sometimes be someone's favorite thing in the world.

![how to draw cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-1.jpg)

A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child's life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.

Step 1:

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**Step 7:** Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

You need to place all the images you wish to include in the video's final cut into a folder and arrange them the same way as they should appear in the video. Even though **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** provides powerful video editing tools that enable you to improve the colors in the footage you are syncing with, it is best to edit your photos via dedicated photo editing software.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab. Moreover, you should also import all audio files you would like to use in your project before doing any actual editing. When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04\.

You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the **Play** button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab. Moreover, you should also import all audio files you would like to use in your project before doing any actual editing. When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04\.

You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the **Play** button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.

Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn't be easier. A lot of the 'whiteboard animation' generators also work as **blackboard animation** generators.

In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.

#### In this article

01 [Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?**

**Blackboard animation** some may say is as outdated as the concept of 'blackboards' themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.

However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, **chalkboard animation** is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it's just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you're looking for — especially if you're looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)

![Traditional Blackboard with Chalk](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation1.png)

## Part 2 **How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?**

But alright, so how do you make it so that your **blackboard animation** is just as suited for the modern generation as it is for the older generation?? Well, that's easy really. You'll need images Or, rather, you'll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with **chalkboard animation**.

With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your **chalkboard animation video** and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.

![Black Blackboard and Drawing Pencils](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation2.png)

## Part 3 **How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?**

Alright, so onto actually talking about how you can go about creating a **chalkboard animation video** Take note, this is going to be an 'overview' kind of tutorial. We've also decided to choose a more 'custom' method, rather than using one of the premium **blackboard animation** generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)

### 01Step 1\. Pick Your Software

The first step in creating **chalkboard animation** is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more 'animation-specific', like After Effects. Or something more 'video-editing-specific' like Filmora.

Again, because this is meant to be more of a 'general' tutorial, we won't be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your **blackboard animation** videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project

![Filmora - Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation3.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Create a Storyboard**

Next, to make the actual **blackboard animation** creation process go smoother, it's important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create

The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don't necessarily have to draw every single frame of your **chalkboard animation** beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won't have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future

![Blackboard Animation - Storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation4.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Draw Characters**

For this step, we say 'characters' and use the word 'draw.' But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you'll need for each scene (if not each frame)

If you're not the 'drawing' type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you're really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind

![Prepare Characters for Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation5.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Put Together Project**

Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That's also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go

In the image below, we're only showing the start of a potential project. We've only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video

![Use Software to Create Blackboard Animation Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation6.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes **blackboard animation** videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you're doing it to promote your services/goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another

**●** Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn't make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals

**●** In our brief 'overview' tutorial, we expand on the subject of **blackboard animation** some more. Be warned, it's not the kind of project you should go into if you're not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.

**●** Still, there's something satisfying about a well-done **chalkboard animation video** that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.

But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you'll need for each scene (if not each frame)

If you're not the 'drawing' type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you're really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind

### 04**Step 4\. Put Together Project**

Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That's also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go

In the image below, we're only showing the start of a potential project. We've only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes **blackboard animation** videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you're doing it to promote your services/goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another

**●** Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn't make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals

**●** In our brief 'overview' tutorial, we expand on the subject of **blackboard animation** some more. Be warned, it's not the kind of project you should go into if you're not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.

**●** Still, there's something satisfying about a well-done **chalkboard animation video** that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.

Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn't be easier. A lot of the 'whiteboard animation' generators also work as **blackboard animation** generators.

In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.

02 [How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?**

**Blackboard animation** some may say is as outdated as the concept of 'blackboards' themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.

However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, **chalkboard animation** is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it's just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you're looking for — especially if you're looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)

![Traditional Blackboard with Chalk](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation1.png)

## Part 2 **How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?**

But alright, so how do you make it so that your **blackboard animation** is just as suited for the modern generation as it is for the older generation?? Well, that's easy really. You'll need images Or, rather, you'll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with **chalkboard animation**.

With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your **chalkboard animation video** and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.

## Part 3 **How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?**

Alright, so onto actually talking about how you can go about creating a **chalkboard animation video** Take note, this is going to be an 'overview' kind of tutorial. We've also decided to choose a more 'custom' method, rather than using one of the premium **blackboard animation** generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)

### 01Step 1\. Pick Your Software

The first step in creating **chalkboard animation** is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more 'animation-specific', like After Effects. Or something more 'video-editing-specific' like Filmora.

Again, because this is meant to be more of a 'general' tutorial, we won't be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your **blackboard animation** videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project

![Filmora - Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation3.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Create a Storyboard**

Next, to make the actual **blackboard animation** creation process go smoother, it's important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create

The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don't necessarily have to draw every single frame of your **chalkboard animation** beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won't have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future
