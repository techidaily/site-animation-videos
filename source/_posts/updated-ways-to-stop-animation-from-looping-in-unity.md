Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Now, you have to uncheck the **Loop** **Time** tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.

### 06**Bonus Tip:**

We want to introduce an excellent video editor software called **[Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. It is from the house of Wondershare, a well-known software company worldwide.

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.

### 06**Bonus Tip:**

We want to introduce an excellent video editor software called **[Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. It is from the house of Wondershare, a well-known software company worldwide.

Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Now, you have to uncheck the **Loop** **Time** tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

03 [5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects](#Part 3)

04 [Adobe Alternative to Make Text Animation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's Text Animation?

![Text Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know1.png)

"**Text Animation**" refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!

## Part 2 **What Adobe Program is Best for Text Animation?**

![Adobe Animation Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know2.png)

Adobe Animate is Adobe's very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

![After Effects: Animators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png)

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

![Per Character 3D Text Properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know5.png)

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

![Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know6.png)

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.

![After Effects: Selectors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know7.png)

As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

![After Effects: Animators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png)

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

![Per Character 3D Text Properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know5.png)

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

![Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know6.png)

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.

![Text Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know1.png)

"**Text Animation**" refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!

A GIF is a lot in use these days over social media platforms, and other online sites. Standing for Graphics Interchange Format, a GIF is basically a looping animation or a video that has a sequence of frames or images.

Though a lot of people can consider a GIF as a short video, there are a few key differences between the two. The first one lies in the name extension. A GIF file is saved as .gif while a video can be saved into several formats like .mp4, .mov, and more.

A video contains visual information having good quality frames as well as sound while a GIF is a short animation that uses some specific information created from a sequence of frames. Moreover, a GIF does not have a sound and the size is also very small.
