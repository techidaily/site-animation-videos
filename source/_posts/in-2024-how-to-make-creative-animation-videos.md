## How to Make Creative Animation Videos

Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive – Walt Disney. Animation video is a craft in which images go through the process of conspiring, layout addition, and photographic chronology to create an illusion of action. In this article, let's learn the importance of video animations and when and why to use this technique.

## What are Video Animation and its importance?

Video as a marketing tool has become more popular but also more important. In this article, you can read more about why media marketing is getting more essential in comparison to text marketing. Therefore, an explainer video with Animation is an amazing way to show your target audience who you are, where you stand for, what you do and how you can solve the customer's problem.

Video animation is an engaging technique that can help you comprehensively tell your story. Animated meaning can be better comprehended as a simulation of motion created by showing a series of pictures. Animated videos for a business catch the viewers and make for an enjoyable story-telling experience.

Often, animation videos are used to explain a concept or process. It's straightforward to make these videos appealing and likable as you can primarily create them however you want. It can take longer to get the point across when people explain how to do something. Animations not only trigger emotions but spark conversations as well.

## What are most common types of Animation?

The purpose of this article is to take you through the complexity of the different types of animation styles and methods. It also covers the track you should take (and what that path entails) to become an animator for each of the five types.

This guide is not about learning how to animate. But instead, it breaks down the five types of Animation available to you and what you'll need to start animating: best software, schools, and courses.

**Motion Graphics (Key framing)**: Motion graphics focus on making dynamic and exciting presentations of moving text logos and fundamental illustrations.

* Motion graphics can be 2D and 3D, and you'll find them everywhere in news, sporting videos, the news, and other TV productions.
* Correct character animation is generally outside the scope of motion graphics, but many core animation principles also apply to motion graphics.
* Creating Motion Graphics depends on the plan used since video editing software often have different user interface or settings, but the idea is the same. Motion Graphics usually involves animating texts, pictures, or video clips using keyframing that is tweened to make a smooth motion between frames.

![key frame animation filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/key-frame-animation-filmora.jpg)

**Traditional Animation**: This is the classic type of Animation you're probably most well known with. In the past, animators drew characters frame by frame, and then those pictures were moved onto transparent sheets for painting. That's where the term animation comes from.

They started scanning drawings into the computer for digital coloring. The important thing is that hand-drawn animators still create their animation frame by frame using the same method and concept as in those old days of paper and cels.

## How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora

Keyframes specify the start or end of a transition in a shot. A series of keyframes can give the semblance of the movement of an object. Keyframes include parameters such as Position, Scale, Opacity, and Rotation. These values can be changed and customized to make animations using keyframing.

Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.

### 2.1 How to animate text in Canva?

With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.

You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the "Animate" option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.

Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to "animate," you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.

In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.

Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.

### 2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?

Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.

One difference between Canva and Wondershare Filmora is that Canva users can only use one audio per presentation. Filmora allows users to overlay multiple soundtracks to their timeline.

![Video Animation in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/canva-animated-graphic-5.png)

Another noteworthy thing in Canva is that users can upload their videos or use videos provided in the video library. You can also embed videos within a frame from the “Elements” section in Canva. You can trim the video input on the slide for time. It can be presented as a “loop” video.

Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.

This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.

Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.

Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.

Playing around with different types of animation can be a great deal of fun and can help you decide which style is most suited to your skills and preferences. There are many [computer animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to help you experiment with, with new forms emerging all the time.

Read on to learn more about some of the most popular types of animated videos around and the steps you need to take to produce them. We will also tell you which software you need to create videos in all sorts of different styles. Let’s begin and look at six different types of animation you might like right now.

You may also like: **[10 Classical Animated Cartoon Types With Examples](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

## The list of 6 types of animation

#### 1\. Traditional animation

As you would expect, this type of animation is the kind of old classic animation drawn on paper. The characters, backgrounds and layout were normally committed to paper by hand, with each drawing being slightly different from its predecessor. The papers were placed on sheets called cels before paint was added to them. Advancements in technology mean animation can be hand-drawn before color is added via software.

Synfig Studio is a popular product for those wishing to produce videos that are traditional in look and feel. It supports a variety of layers and offers a bone system as well as sound support.

#### 2\. 2D animation

With 2D animation, movement is created in a two-dimensional environment. Characters and figures can move up, down, left or right but won’t move nearer or further away from the viewer. Many [2D animated video software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be used to make this kind of video. Pencil 2D is a leading solution noted for its simplicity and ease of use.

This type of animation is ideal for animating on the move and runs on various operating platforms. What’s also great about Pencil 2D is that it allows you to switch between raster and vector workflows quickly and is completely free to use, even if you need it for commercial purposes.

#### 3\. 3D animation

With 3D animation, you can represent real-world 3D images in a digital space. The main three processes of 3D are modeling, layout and animation plus rendering. There are many reliable solutions for 3D animation on the market, with Autodesk 3DS Max being a market leader.

This product offers simple, robust modeling, allowing you to create a wide range of environments with richly-detailed characters and enjoy high-end rendering. It is used for producing games, product design, architecture and more.

#### 4\. Clay animation

Clay animation is also called claymation and has been around for many years. In clay animation, clay pieces are used to create characters and background animation. The pieces are moved or deformed between frames so continuous motion can occur.

One leading solution for clay animation is Adobe Animate CC. With this product, you can create vector animations for apps, games, videos and more. You can publish the results quickly and can animate pretty much anything, allowing your characters to walk, talk, blink and more with ease.

It’s also possible to create illusions of depths via the enhanced camera tool, and new features are being added all the time.

#### 5\. HTML animation

HMTL5 allows you to do all sorts of things including elements of video and animation creation. You can create excellent animated content via a fusion of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3\. HTML5 is essentially the language of today’s most exciting websites and is used to add vast beauty and efficiency to them.

HTML5 Maker is a free solution ideal for beginners and pros that supports various leading text filters and offers a diverse library of images. You can use this tool to produce elegant animations with stunning transitions and create gorgeous Instagram-esque effects.

#### 6\. Kinetic Typography Animation

Typography animation as another type of animation enables you to do all sorts of exciting and thought-provoking things with letters and fonts. Kinetic typography is based on the concept of moving text and is often used for advertising purposes and to deliver important information including statistics and more.

Videos involving kinetic typography animation can help you demand the attention of your audience. One very popular tool for creating kinetic typography animation is Renderforest.

This solution is ideal even for those without vast technical expertise and helps you create animations, music visualizations, slideshows and much more in mere moments. Trailers, YouTube openings, logo animations are frequently created with the tool, as are explainer animations and whiteboard videos, to give you just a few more examples.

## Conclusion

Once you have found the types of animated videos and tools that appeal to you the most and have created your content, you can put magical finishing touches to your videos by using Filmora.

You may be amazed to see how quickly you can get to grips with these different styles and tools even if your experience is relatively limited, so why wait any longer to start experimenting? More and more people are surpassing their expectations all the time by playing around with different resources for online animation.

## The list of 6 types of animation

#### 1\. Traditional animation

As you would expect, this type of animation is the kind of old classic animation drawn on paper. The characters, backgrounds and layout were normally committed to paper by hand, with each drawing being slightly different from its predecessor. The papers were placed on sheets called cels before paint was added to them. Advancements in technology mean animation can be hand-drawn before color is added via software.

Synfig Studio is a popular product for those wishing to produce videos that are traditional in look and feel. It supports a variety of layers and offers a bone system as well as sound support.

#### 2\. 2D animation

With 2D animation, movement is created in a two-dimensional environment. Characters and figures can move up, down, left or right but won’t move nearer or further away from the viewer. Many [2D animated video software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be used to make this kind of video. Pencil 2D is a leading solution noted for its simplicity and ease of use.

This type of animation is ideal for animating on the move and runs on various operating platforms. What’s also great about Pencil 2D is that it allows you to switch between raster and vector workflows quickly and is completely free to use, even if you need it for commercial purposes.

#### 3\. 3D animation

With 3D animation, you can represent real-world 3D images in a digital space. The main three processes of 3D are modeling, layout and animation plus rendering. There are many reliable solutions for 3D animation on the market, with Autodesk 3DS Max being a market leader.

This product offers simple, robust modeling, allowing you to create a wide range of environments with richly-detailed characters and enjoy high-end rendering. It is used for producing games, product design, architecture and more.

#### 4\. Clay animation

Clay animation is also called claymation and has been around for many years. In clay animation, clay pieces are used to create characters and background animation. The pieces are moved or deformed between frames so continuous motion can occur.

One leading solution for clay animation is Adobe Animate CC. With this product, you can create vector animations for apps, games, videos and more. You can publish the results quickly and can animate pretty much anything, allowing your characters to walk, talk, blink and more with ease.

It’s also possible to create illusions of depths via the enhanced camera tool, and new features are being added all the time.

#### 5\. HTML animation

HMTL5 allows you to do all sorts of things including elements of video and animation creation. You can create excellent animated content via a fusion of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3\. HTML5 is essentially the language of today’s most exciting websites and is used to add vast beauty and efficiency to them.

HTML5 Maker is a free solution ideal for beginners and pros that supports various leading text filters and offers a diverse library of images. You can use this tool to produce elegant animations with stunning transitions and create gorgeous Instagram-esque effects.

#### 6\. Kinetic Typography Animation

Typography animation as another type of animation enables you to do all sorts of exciting and thought-provoking things with letters and fonts. Kinetic typography is based on the concept of moving text and is often used for advertising purposes and to deliver important information including statistics and more.

Videos involving kinetic typography animation can help you demand the attention of your audience. One very popular tool for creating kinetic typography animation is Renderforest.

This solution is ideal even for those without vast technical expertise and helps you create animations, music visualizations, slideshows and much more in mere moments. Trailers, YouTube openings, logo animations are frequently created with the tool, as are explainer animations and whiteboard videos, to give you just a few more examples.

## Conclusion

Once you have found the types of animated videos and tools that appeal to you the most and have created your content, you can put magical finishing touches to your videos by using Filmora.

You may be amazed to see how quickly you can get to grips with these different styles and tools even if your experience is relatively limited, so why wait any longer to start experimenting? More and more people are surpassing their expectations all the time by playing around with different resources for online animation.
