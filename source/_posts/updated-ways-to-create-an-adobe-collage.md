Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.

## Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations

3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.

### 01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients

Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his/her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.

### 02Training Of Medical Professionals

Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.

### 03Educating New Professionals

For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.

### 04Used As A Marketing Tool

Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.

### 05Marketing To Medical Professional

While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.

## Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs

First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some **3D GIF Maker** tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of **3D GIF Maker** tools and **3D GIF Generator** tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.

### 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first **3D GIF Maker** on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a **3D GIF Maker**, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.

 **Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)**

The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.

### 03EaseUS Video Editor

Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a **3D GIF Creator** quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.

The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)

Next, upload the file or files that you want to turn into a GIF.

 **Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)**

Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere **3D GIF Maker**. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.

The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.

It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.

The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)

The reason being 2D animations have a lower production cost and they still offer complete liberty over creativity. However, it's worth noting that editing a visually engaging 2D animation requires expertise.

That's why it's always an ideal solution to hire a dedicated **2D animation company**. Such organizations have experienced video editors who specialize in 2D video editing and can craft the perfect 2D animation for your brand. In this article, we are going to walk you through a list of the top 12 **2D animation studios** you can hire to launch an enticing marketing video for your business.

## Part 1 What is a 2D Animation Video and How Much Does a 2D Animation Video Cost?

First things first; what is a 2D animation and why is it necessary to hire a **2D animation company**? In layman's terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can't be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).

Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it's always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.

The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000\. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it's also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You'll have to be extra cautious while picking through the **best 2D animation studios**.

## Part 2 How Much Time Does It Take to Create a 2D Animation Video?

Due to their immense popularity in the marketing world, many business owners and marketers want to know how much time it takes to create a 2D animation video. Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated **2D animation company**, you'll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don't know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.

# 10 Scary Anime Girls That Will Make You Creepy

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

Even though girls are usually displayed as cute and pinkish and lovely, some animes display them as creepy. And believe me, these creepy anime girls have a huge fan base and are capable of giving the audience a chill over the spine while watching them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

* [1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)](#part1)
* [2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)](#part2)
* [3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)](#part3)
* [4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)](#part4)
* [5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)](#part5)
* [6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)](#part6)
* [7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)](#part7)
* [8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)](#part8)
* [9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)](#part9)
* [10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)](#part10)

### 1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

![hell-girl-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hell-girl-scary-anime.jpg)

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

There is too much to the story, and saying more about it may reveal the suspense. The story is filled with horror and adventure, and the character of Shion absorbs some of the darkness of the town, which gives a scary impact on the audience.

![higurashi-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-higurashi-scary-anime.jpg)

### 3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)

Sachiko from Corpse Party is a friendly-looking but scary character who loves to rip out the tongues of some of her fellow characters. She tortures students in Heavenly Host Elementry School which is a living hell in the anime.

Sachiko unleashes a lot of horror in the series and she plays the part of an elementary school ghost breaking all the expectations of the audience. Torturing her fellow mates and cutting their tongues out before death is something that makes Sachiko a perfect scary anime girl.

![corpse-party-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-corpse-party-scary-anime.jpg)

### 4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)

Shiro, the creepy-looking girl from Deadman Wonderland is another character to be scared of. She was adopted for the only purpose of being used as a human experiment in her childhood. The experiments instilled a very scary character in her which gives a horror nature to the anime in total.

The experiments on here were very painful and multiple personalities called "The Wretched Egg" were developed by her to cope up with torture. The creepy nature and the use of her special skills to murder some characters in the anime and frame her adopted brother for it is very dark and scary.

![shiro-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-shiro-scary-anime.jpg)

### 5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)

Megumi Shimizu of Shiki is a young girl and the first of all to be killed by the Kirishiki family. She was the first person who died who was not Yamairi and also the first to rise as Shiki.

After becoming a Shiki Megumi became very malicious and attacked the villagers. She enjoyed attacking them and that is very creepy. She also was ready to kill Tohru Mutou and Kaori’s father due to some small reasons.
