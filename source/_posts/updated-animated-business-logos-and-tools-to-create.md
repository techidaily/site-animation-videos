Navigate to the bottom right corner of your selected image to locate a button similar to a photo slideshow. Tap the button to see a ‘1’ inscribed in a blue circle appear on your chosen image.

**Step 3: Make Further Selections**

You can now proceed to select other images or videos for the slideshow, in a similar fashion as the first one. You are allowed to include a maximum of 10 media files within the slideshow.

**Step 4: Customize Your Creation**

Tap the ‘Next’ button when you have finished making the required selections. The editor interface will now open to let you customize the selected images with a series of effects and filters, both one at a time, as well as the entire set altogether.

Applying a variety of text overlays would help to keep the audience curious about the next visual delight.

**●** **Prefer a Vertical Aspect Ratio**

While the landscape mode tends to ward off certain portions of the visual media from a slideshow being played across multiple sized screens, using the portrait mode with a vertical aspect ratio suits best to almost every screen size. Taking care of this fact will ensure that your audience does not get distracted with the semi visible contents of the slideshow story.

**●** **Choose Your Editing Effects Wisely**

Regardless of the slideshow creation tool you prefer, there are a diversity of effects, templates, design elements and filters to uplift your craft with the perfect look.

#### 1\. How To Crop A GIF?

Web and desktop-based GIF makers and video editing software products make cropping a GIF a routine action. However, the exact steps you will need to take in order to crop a GIF file, depend on the GIF maker or video editing software you choose.

In most cases, you will just have to click on the Crop option, specify the area of the image you want to remove and confirm that you want to create a GIF. It is essential to keep in mind that cropping a GIF can alter its aspect ratio.

#### 2\. How To Reduce A GIF’s Size?

Increasing or decreasing the size of a GIF takes only a few moments of your time. You need to go through a few easy steps to resize a GIF online, since you just have to upload a file to the platform of your choosing, specify by how much you want to reduce the GIF’s size and then wait for the task to be completed.

In addition, reducing the number of frames a GIF contains will impact the size of the file, as the size of a GIF file increases with each new frame, you add to a GIF.

#### 3\. How To Crop A GIF To A Circle?

Whether or not you can crop a GIF into a circle, depends on the cropping tools the app you are using offers. Some GIF makers allow you to choose the shape to which you are going to crop a GIF, while others don’t provide this option.

Using [Filmora’s mask features](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably one of the easiest ways to crop a GIF to a circle, as you simply have to apply the mask to the footage and specify which parts of the GIF’s frames are going to be removed.
