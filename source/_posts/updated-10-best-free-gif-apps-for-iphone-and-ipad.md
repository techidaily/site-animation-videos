03 [5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects](#Part 3)

04 [Adobe Alternative to Make Text Animation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's Text Animation?

![Text Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know1.png)

"**Text Animation**" refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!

## Part 2 **What Adobe Program is Best for Text Animation?**

![Adobe Animation Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know2.png)

Adobe Animate is Adobe's very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

![After Effects: Animators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png)

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

![Per Character 3D Text Properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know5.png)

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

![Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know6.png)

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.

Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn't mean that you cannot design **2D animations with Unity**.

In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.

#### In this article

01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

![animations in unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg)

That's it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.

## Part 3 Part 3 Creating 2D Animations for Your Videos - An Effective Solution for Video Editors
