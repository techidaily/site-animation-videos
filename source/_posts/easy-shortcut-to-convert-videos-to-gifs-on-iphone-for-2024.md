![Text Motion Project with Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/why-these-10%2B-top-text-motion-templates-are-worth-your-attention1.png)

Have a look at the screenshot above that we included of an example project on the video editor, **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. As you can see, we inserted **text in motion** at the very start. And despite being a still screenshot of said **text motion graphics**, the preview is eye-catching even when paused!

This is the kind of project that you can do yourself with the right templates and the right video editor. We've got your back on the first in the list coming up. And, as for the second, we recommend that you try out Filmora! It is, as you can see, quite an expansive software. One that will allow you to truly make the most of the **text motion graphics** you'll be able to create at the end of this article.

## Part 2 **10 Best Text Motion After Effects**

Alright, now let's move on to our promised **Text Motion Graphics After Effects** and **Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro** templates. We've tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!

### 01[**Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal' by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you're confused, it's a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.

Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.

### 02[**Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title**](https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

The next **text motion** template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title' also created by Mogrt. This one is **text motion graphics** that you can use for **Premiere Pro** and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It's a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!

As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as **text motion** for [after effects](https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt), it is available for that as well!

### 03[**Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro**](https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?%5Fga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text' graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we've provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that's just starting out and doesn't want anything too complicated.

### 04[**30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt**](https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?%5Fga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets' by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It's also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

### 05[**Comic Bubbles MOGRT**](https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?%5Fga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

### 06[**Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)**](https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?%5Fga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal' is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the **text motion graphics** are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It's perfect for those looking for underwater-themed **text motion graphics**. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.

This is **Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro**. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.

### 07[**Text Messages Toolkit**](https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?%5Fga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit' might be a fun **text motion graphics** for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it's a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message' interactions. It's customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that's what you want.

### 08[**Large Text Title Block**](https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/)

With the ‘large text title block' template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you're wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!

### 09[**Blueprint Titles**](https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?%5Fga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Want something that's a little quirkier? Or, perhaps, instructional? Then the ‘Blueprint Titles' template is one that you can consider. As you can perhaps guess from the name, it allows you to create **text motion graphics** in a style that is similar to the kind of blueprints you usually see when working with design or architecture.

### 10[**Dynamic Minimalism**](https://videohive.net/item/dynamic-minimalism-essential-graphics-mogrt/21637324?s%5Frank=16&%5Fga=2.111208772.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Sometimes, simple really is best! And, this next template, the ‘Dynamic Minimalism' **text motion after effects** and **text motion graphics premiere pro** template is one that you might want in your arsenal just for the sake of your simpler projects! The kit comes with 30 different animations, as well as other customization functions that you can play around with to add a little personality to what are otherwise very minimalistic designs.

The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal' by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you're confused, it's a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.

Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.

### 02[**Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title**](https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?%5Fga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This one is **text motion graphics** that you can use for **Premiere Pro** and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It's a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!

As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as **text motion** for [after effects](https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt), it is available for that as well!

### 03[**Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro**](https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?%5Fga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text' graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we've provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case.

This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets' by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It's also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it's not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch' effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn't make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!

The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.

Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles', kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that's the kind of look that you're looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic' text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy' text in between animated projects.

For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we've linked if you want to see it in action!)

### 08[**Large Text Title Block**](https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/)

With the ‘large text title block' template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects.

### 09[**Blueprint Titles**](https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?%5Fga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481)

Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.

**●** First, you draw the face but make sure you don't add a nose but do a black outline.

**●** Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don't use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.

**●** Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.

**●** Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-8.png)

**Step 2:** Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?

![how to draw your own cartoon character 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-9.png)

**Step 3:** Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png)

**Step 4:** Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-11.png)

**Step 7:** Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 07](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-14.png)

Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Now, you have to uncheck the **Loop** **Time** tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.

Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Now, you have to uncheck the **Loop** **Time** tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)
