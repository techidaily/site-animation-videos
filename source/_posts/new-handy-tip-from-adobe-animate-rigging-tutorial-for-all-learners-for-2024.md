## Part 1 Do You Understand How Auto Rig Mapping Works?

The primary goal of animation is to animate or construct human-like characters that tend to mimic the structure of a human body or animal body. The closer is the resemblance of the motion, the better is the animation. However, mimicking a human-like motion with precision is rather difficult. This is because humans have a sophisticated structure, and the mimicry of a complex motion like that performed by human beings through animation is indeed difficult.

![Rig Mapping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/handy-tips-from-adobe-animate-rigging-tutorial-for-all-learners-01.jpg)

For countering this, animators decided to use rigging. Rigging is essentially a technology wherein the skeletal structure of the animated character must be designed prior to the final character. The primary components of the skeletal structure, i.e. the skull, the jaw, the limbs (arm and leg) are modeled to finally form a whole skeleton.

The structure is fine tuned and the skeleton is given rotatory motion, and prismatic motion wherever needed. Each part of the animated character is enabled to move and mimic complex motion.

## Part 1: How to Combine/Merge Animated GIFs Into One

### Method 1: Merge GIFs into one with Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is one of the top-rated photo editing software tools and nowadays it is popularly being used for GIF combining. Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:

**Step 1:** Import GIFs to combine

First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.

**Step 2:** Save GIF with name

Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.

![GIF combiner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg)

Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.

![GIF combiner file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg)

**Note:** If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.

**Step 3:** Copy frames

![copy frames in GIF combiner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-frames.jpg)

Now move to the tab of the first GIF file and then to the timeline toolbar. On the top right corner of your screen, you will find the menu icon. Here you need to select and copy all frames.

**Step 4:** Paste your copy

It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.

**Step 5:** Copy and paste

Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.

**Step 6:** To make separation

## Part 1 What is Rigging Animation

### 01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig

Walk into any professional animation studio toady, you would notice unfamiliar skeleton figures in at least one of the screens.

This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.

What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.

### 02How Does Rigging Work?

The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.

There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the **skeletal structure** which is the basic goal in **rigging animation.**

With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.

The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.

These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.

This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.

Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.

All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.

### 03How is Rigging Used?

Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.

Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.

There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.

This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.

### 04Intro to Rigging Software

You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.

Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.

Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.

Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.

You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.

## Part 1 What is Rigging Animation

### 01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig

Walk into any professional animation studio toady, you would notice unfamiliar skeleton figures in at least one of the screens.

This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.

What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.

### 02How Does Rigging Work?

The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.

There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the **skeletal structure** which is the basic goal in **rigging animation.**

With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.

The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.

These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.

This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.

Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.

All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.

### 03How is Rigging Used?

Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.

Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.

There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.

This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.

### 04Intro to Rigging Software

You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.

Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.

Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.

Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.

You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.

## Part 2 The Ultimate Collection for Free Maya Rigs \[2022\]

### 01How's Maya Rigs?

To tell the truth, every year you have spent on learning animation would come into great use in making your imagination come to life. Maya is probably the one software which gives you credit for just knowing it.

Maya has several levels of features you need to practice before you can call yourself a Maya master.

The best way to get your hands practiced on animating on Maya is by becoming well versed with all the stats and proportions while working with rigs. You would surely need to get your hands on high quality rig packages that makes the learning experience even more worth it.

With time, you would get better at understanding of the specifics of building a structure you would be showing in the final result. However getting stuck with the wrong type of rig can end up making your animating experience counterintuitive.

In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.

#### In this article

01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

![animations in unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg)

Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn't mean that you cannot design **2D animations with Unity**.

In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.

#### In this article

01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

![animations in unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg)

That's it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.

Born inUzushiogakure Uzumaki clan, Kushina was a beautiful woman in her early 20s with a slender figure.

She is the deuteragonist and former Vice-commander of the Knights of the Blood Oath in Sword Art Online. Early on, Asuna was shown to be a strong fighter who did not care about dying until she met Kirito. However, Asuna is a bit overly serious, and as the SAO series progresses, she is shown nothing but the wife of Kirito.

### 4\. Saber- Fate/Stay Night

![saber anime character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-saber-anime-character.jpg)

![rias gremory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-rias-gremory.jpg)

School's number one beauty, the red-haired Rias Gremory, deserves a spot on our list. She is the only daughter of Zeoticus Venelana Gremory and the next head of the Gremory clan. We love when she is called the Crimson-haired Ruin Princess. While she has charming features, she is very kind and compassionate even to her servants – something which makes her a fan favorite,

### 6\. Nobara Kugisaki- Jujutsu Kaisen

![nobara kugisaki](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-nobara-kugisaki.jpg)

Out of the many unique anime characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara Kugosaki is a tough girl most anime fans are drawn to. She is one of the Jujutsu manga's three primary protagonists who moved to Tokyo. Nobara isn't your typical strong lady; she is confident and outspoken about her appearance and herself as a person.

As a rebellious fighter, she has shown superhuman pain tolerance while fighting foes even larger than herself. Nobara fans love her proficiency with various curse-infused weaponry, such as the hammer and nail, straw dolls, and the rubber mallet.

### 7\. Mikasa Ackerman-Attack on Titan

![mikasa ackerman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-mikasa-ackerman.jpg)

As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best **anime girl characters.** The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.

Once a cheerful, outgoing, and innocent child living with her parents, Mikasa grows up to be quite stoic and dangerous at times. Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent's brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.

### 8\. Motoko Kusanagi-Ghost in the Shell

![motoko kusanagi](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-motoko-kusanagi.jpg)

Who doesn't know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body? Motoko Kusanagi is employed as an officer for Public Security Section 9, a Japanese National Public Safety Commission division. After the airplane accident in her childhood, Motoko was comatose until her consciousness was put into a prosthetic body. Since then, she has been an excellent hacker with incredible intelligence and combat skills respected among her colleagues. Motoko connects with the audience on a greater level, for she is strong, cool, intellectual, and artificial at the same time.

### 9\. Touka Kirishima-Tokyo Ghoul

![touka kirishima](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-touka-kirishima.jpg)

Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.

In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki. Being a rugged, know-it-all kind of girl but with a touch of kindness, people adore Touka Kirishima.

### 10\. Tsukuyo-Gintama

![tsukuyo anime character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-tsukuyo-anime-character.jpg)

Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as "Courtesan of Death." She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.

### 11\. Lucy Heartfilia- Fairy Tail

![lucy heartfilia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-lucy-heartfilia.jpg)

Lucy Heartfilia, an iconic anime girl from the Fairy Tail manga series, has the best character growth from the first episode to the last. When we first see her, she is a happy, innocent little girl who grows up to be a divine spirit mage and mother to seven children.

There are so many likable qualities about Lucy – she is fair and beautiful, responsible, with impressive magic skills, and a desire to become a world-famous author. Lucy Heartfilia leaves her home after her mother's death with an ambition for independence, something admired by the fandom.

### 12\. Yui Komori- Diabolik Lovers

![yui komori](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-yui-komori.jpg)

Yui is living with Cordelia's heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.

When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it's not a surprise that Diabolik Lover's Yui Komori is everyone's favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there's more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.

### 13\. Revy-Black Lagoon

![revy anime character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-revy-anime-character.jpg)

No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can't really relate to this complex **female anime character** until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.

### 14\. Shoko Nishimiya- A Silent Voice

![shoko nishimiya](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/14-shoko-nishimiya.jpg)

This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it's hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.

### 15\. Esdeath- Akame ga Kill

![esdeath female anime-character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/15-esdeath-female-anime-character.jpg)

Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath's spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General's apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father's death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.

## What Makes a Female Anime Character Stand out?

A bunch of unique and exciting anime characters is released every year. While some of these turn out lovable gems, others prove long-forgotten failures. But what is it about an anime character that makes it stand out?

Everything shapes the perfect leading anime character, from their personalities to their clothes and styling to the character development. Memorable **anime girl characters** are rare, well-written protagonists with profound nature, exciting stories, and emotions that relate to anime fans.

So, which **female anime character** is your favorite?

You can't really relate to this complex **female anime character** until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years.

As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General's apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots.

### Frequently Asked Questions About GIF Apps on Android

#### 1\. Is It Possible To Create Gifs From An Android Device?

Recording a GIF with a camera on an Android phone is not possible unless you install a third-party app. There a lot of GIF apps for Android to choose from that enable you to create GIFs directly from your phone.

GIF Camera, GIF Maker or GIF Creator are just a few among countless apps that allow Android users to make GIFs, although some of them place limits on the maximum duration of a GIF. In addition, most of these apps are equipped with filters and effects that can be easily applied to a GIF.

#### 2\. How To Add Text To A GIF From An Android Phone?

In case the app you are using to record a GIF with an Android phone doesn’t offer text tools you will have to use a video editing app to add text to a GIF you created. However, most GIF apps are equipped with at least basic text editing tools that enable you to apply text layers over the animated GIFs you create with them.

After you launch a GIF app and record a new GIF, you can use the text tool to insert the text you want to include in a GIF and to adjust its position, size, or color.

#### 3\. Why Can’t I Preview Gifs On My Android Phone?

Android OS has had compatibility issues with GIF files for years, as nearly all versions of the OS don’t offer native support for GIFs. In case you are having trouble previewing a GIF file from an Android device, you should try restarting it in order to make sure that some unrelated issue isn’t causing the lagging.

If the issue persists, you should update the OS to Android 7.1 or later, because previous versions of the OS may experience difficulties displaying GIF files.
