"Where is everyone getting their **3D Text Animation** templates?"

To answer this request, we've compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like **3D Spinning Text (After Effects)** but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., **3D Text Animation** templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.

04 [Secrets to Learning More Animation Tactics](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

![Add Graphic Elements to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates5.png)

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!

**●** You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.

**●** Of course, if you don't have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you're looking for.

**●** SECRET TIP! If you're looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It's a video editor, first and foremost, but that's not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

![Add Graphic Elements to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates5.png)

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!

**●** You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.

**●** Of course, if you don't have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you're looking for.

**●** SECRET TIP! If you're looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It's a video editor, first and foremost, but that's not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!

"Where is everyone getting their **3D Text Animation** templates?"

To answer this request, we've compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like **3D Spinning Text (After Effects)** but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., **3D Text Animation** templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.

04 [Secrets to Learning More Animation Tactics](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

02 [How to upload multiple photos to Pinterest?](#Part 2)

03 [How to display Pinterest’s latest pins in a slideshow? ](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow**

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**●** It would be the user's profile URL + feed/RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser's URL. That is your profile URL.

**●** For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser's URL bar.

![Construct Pinterest Feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

![Add the Slideshow Widget](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-2.jpg)

Under Source, select Other.

![Add the Slideshow Widget 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-3.jpg)

Put in the converted Pinterest RSS feed URL from step 2 into the Feed URL text box.

Click Save and view your blog.

## Part 2 **How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest**

If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

![Log into your Pinterest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-4.jpg)

**Step 2: Add Title**

Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe's title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.

**Step 3: Select a Board**

The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.

## Part 3 **How to Make Pinterest Slideshow In 5 Simple Ways**

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

03 [How to display Pinterest’s latest pins in a slideshow? ](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow**

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**●** It would be the user's profile URL + feed/RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser's URL. That is your profile URL.

**●** For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser's URL bar.

![Construct Pinterest Feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

![Add the Slideshow Widget](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-2.jpg)

Under Source, select Other.

![Add the Slideshow Widget 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-3.jpg)

Put in the converted Pinterest RSS feed URL from step 2 into the Feed URL text box.

Click Save and view your blog.

## Part 2 **How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest**

If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

![Log into your Pinterest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-4.jpg)

Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe's title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced graphics designer, you can use Adobe Character Animator to animate 2D characters easily. But, if you are an absolute beginner, it might take a few weeks to get familiar with the software's features/workflow.

![Adobe animate character tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-00.jpg)

Irrespective of your experience with the tool, this **Adobe animate character tutorial** will help you get started and edit visually appealing animated shorts.

02 [Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial](#Part 3)

04 [One-Stop Solution to Edit High-Quality Videos in Every Situation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?

### 1\. Start With a Script

If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It'll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg)

If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you'll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you'll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.

### 2\. Record the Voiceover

The next step in our **Adobe Animate character tutorial** is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.

![voice over](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg)

Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.

### 3\. Start Creating the Character

At this point in our **Adobe animate character tutorial**, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you'll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it'll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.

![character development in animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg)

Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you'll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.

If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it'll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.

## Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?

That's how you can animate a character in Adobe character animator and create visually stunning animations. However, many beginners want to know if it's easy to use Adobe character animator. The answer is Yes! With Character Animator, Adobe has developed a relatively easy-to-use interface that anyone can use easily.

If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you'll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you'll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.

### 2\. Record the Voiceover

The next step in our **Adobe Animate character tutorial** is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.

![voice over](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg)

Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.

### 3\. Start Creating the Character

At this point in our **Adobe animate character tutorial**, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you'll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it'll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.

Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you'll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.

If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it'll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.
