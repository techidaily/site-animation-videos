Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It's a good way of starting if you're not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won't demand any immediate monetary commitment.

Now, as for its features, today, we'll be focusing on **Blender Rigging** features.

#### In this article

01 [Why Use Blender Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]](#Part 2)

03 [Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Use Blender Rigging?**

**Blender Character Rigging** is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it's capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.

So, if you want to create video projects for your audience's entertainment or edification with animation, then **Blender Rigging** is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished **Blender Rigging** animations.)

![Blender Character Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes1.png)

## Part 2 **The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]**

For this next section, we're going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about **Blender Character Rigging**, **Blender Facial Rigging**, **Blender Muscle Rig**, and so on.

These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we've linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it's something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender' experience.)

### 01**Blender Character Rigging**

The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, **Blender Character Rigging**. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy **Blender character rigging**, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.

### 02**Blender Facial Rigging**

Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about **Blender Facial Rigging** from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of **Blender Rigging** tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face's character to become animated.)

### 03**Blender Muscle Rigging**

Creating a **Blender Muscle Rig** is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage' as you say, with your Animations. The video that we've attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of **Blender Rigging** in general and has extensively explained how to create a **Blender Human Rig** from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.

### 04**Blender Rigging**

Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional' methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It's an especially good skill to learn if you're more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)

### 05**Blender Rigging**

This next tutorial is an introduction to basic **Blender Rigging**. It's a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.

## Part 3 **Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course**

For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about **Blender Rigging**. Whether it be about **Blender character rigging**, **Blender facial rigging**, **free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs**, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.

### 01**Where to Learn the Course?**

The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters' **blender rigging** course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.

### 02**Other Tools to Learn Rigging**

As for other places to learn? We suggest the "Blender Fundamentals" course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is "Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of **Blender rigging** (including **Blender rigging** and **Blender rigging** videos.)

![Blender Fundamentals on YouTube. By Blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes3.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in trying out **blender rigging** yourself, you'll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.

**●** Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.

**●** For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common **Blender Rigging** subjects.

**●** If you're looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master's introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender's own "Blender Fundamental" series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you'll need to know.)

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced graphics designer, you can use Adobe Character Animator to animate 2D characters easily. But, if you are an absolute beginner, it might take a few weeks to get familiar with the software's features/workflow.

![Adobe animate character tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-00.jpg)

Irrespective of your experience with the tool, this **Adobe animate character tutorial** will help you get started and edit visually appealing animated shorts.

02 [Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial](#Part 3)

04 [One-Stop Solution to Edit High-Quality Videos in Every Situation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?

### 1\. Start With a Script

If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It'll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg)

If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you'll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you'll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.

### 2\. Record the Voiceover

The next step in our **Adobe Animate character tutorial** is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.

![voice over](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg)

Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.

![create animation pencil2d 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-6.jpg)

### 2\. Draw your animated character

Since you're trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.

![create animation pencil2d 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-7.jpg)

Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you've your desired animated video.

![create animation pencil2d 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-9.jpg)

### 2\. The eraser tool

You've a brush tool; it's almost common sense that there'd be an eraser. The eraser tool has an eraser as its icon. If you wish to use the eraser, click on the eraser tool or simply click the E button on your keyboard. Once you've selected the tool, you need to simply hover over the parts you wish to erase.

### 3\. Bucket tool

The bucket tool is another useful tool that you can find in the left tool pane of pencil 2d animation. The tool icon looks like a bucket and it is used to fill an entire area with a particular color. You can choose the color you'd like to fill from the color pallet available on the left side. Alternatively, you can also access the bucket tool by pressing the "K" key on your keyboard.

### 4\. Custom colors

A cool feature that you can find on pencil 2d animation software is the custom color one. You can merge and mix colors according to your choice and create your own color. To do so, you need to click on the small color box that you'll find at the top right of your screen. By doing so, a huge color wheel will appear on your screen. Now you can either enter values of the R, G, and B if you wish to merge different colors and make a new one or select a particular color from the huge color wheel that appears in front of you. These colors vary in gradient, shade, and a lot of different factors.

### 5\. The Undo button

The Undo button is a highly useful functionality for the lazy ones who do not wish to erase the mistake they made. By undoing, the previous step gets reverted and you can start over again. The traditional undo shortcut, Ctrl+Z does work in the pencil 2d animation. Alternatively, you can also use the undo feature via the user interface. You can do so by heading over to the edit option in the topmost bar. The first option in the drop-down menu would be undo.

## Part 3 How to Create Animations with Pencil2D?

Creating animations in pencil 2d is slightly sophisticated and certainly needs minimal practice. Follow the steps listed below in order to learn how to animate through pencil 2d to make your first animation.

### 1\. Ensure that you've turned on your bitmap on the first frame

Animation works through quick switching of frame which makes it appear as though the object is in motion. By turning on the bitmap, pencil 2d animation ensures that you've no blank frames at the start of your animation.

![create animation pencil2d 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-6.jpg)

### 2\. Draw your animated character

Since you're trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.

![create animation pencil2d 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-7.jpg)

### 3.The three circular buttons

Once you're satisfied with the character you draw, you need to spot the 3 circular buttons which are arranged in the "+","-","+" order. By pressing the first "+" button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the "-" button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next "+" button, it will duplicate the current slide.

![create animation pencil2d 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-8.jpg)

### 4.Repeat until you get an animation

Now that you know how to deal with multiple frames, you can continue creating frames and making the animated characters move by tweaking with the drawing in every frame. For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you've your desired animated video.

![create animation pencil2d 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-9.jpg)
