Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.

When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your **stop motion claymation** doesn’t feel jerky at all.

After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.

Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the **stop motion animation claymation**. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.

## Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it

We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.

![voila ai artist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-make-3d-cartoon-of-yourself-01.jpg)

The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.

**●** Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone's Camera rolling permission.

**●** Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature & and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.

**●** Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a **celebrities** option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.

**●** Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D & Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.

If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free & watermark free animated representations.

## Part 2 How to Create a 3D Cartoon of Yourself for Meta

Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.

The process behind creating a **3D cartoon of yourself** for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.

Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.

**●** You can then ‘liquify' these layers to form a mould for your image.

**●** Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.

**●** Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.

**●** You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.

## Make Creative Animation Videos

Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive – Walt Disney. Animation video is a craft in which images go through the process of conspiring, layout addition, and photographic chronology to create an illusion of action. In this article, let's learn the importance of video animations and when and why to use this technique.

![create catchy animation video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-catchy-animation-video.jpg)

## What are Video Animation and its importance?

Video as a marketing tool has become more popular but also more important. In this article, you can read more about why media marketing is getting more essential in comparison to text marketing. Therefore, an explainer video with Animation is an amazing way to show your target audience who you are, where you stand for, what you do and how you can solve the customer's problem.

Video animation is an engaging technique that can help you comprehensively tell your story. Animated meaning can be better comprehended as a simulation of motion created by showing a series of pictures. Animated videos for a business catch the viewers and make for an enjoyable story-telling experience.

Often, animation videos are used to explain a concept or process. It's straightforward to make these videos appealing and likable as you can primarily create them however you want. It can take longer to get the point across when people explain how to do something. Animations not only trigger emotions but spark conversations as well.

## What are most common types of Animation?

The purpose of this article is to take you through the complexity of the different types of animation styles and methods. It also covers the track you should take (and what that path entails) to become an animator for each of the five types.

This guide is not about learning how to animate. But instead, it breaks down the five types of Animation available to you and what you'll need to start animating: best software, schools, and courses.

**Motion Graphics (Key framing)**: Motion graphics focus on making dynamic and exciting presentations of moving text logos and fundamental illustrations.

* Motion graphics can be 2D and 3D, and you'll find them everywhere in news, sporting videos, the news, and other TV productions.
* Correct character animation is generally outside the scope of motion graphics, but many core animation principles also apply to motion graphics.
* Creating Motion Graphics depends on the plan used since video editing software often have different user interface or settings, but the idea is the same. Motion Graphics usually involves animating texts, pictures, or video clips using keyframing that is tweened to make a smooth motion between frames.

![key frame animation filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/key-frame-animation-filmora.jpg)

**Traditional Animation**: This is the classic type of Animation you're probably most well known with. In the past, animators drew characters frame by frame, and then those pictures were moved onto transparent sheets for painting. That's where the term animation comes from.

They started scanning drawings into the computer for digital coloring. The important thing is that hand-drawn animators still create their animation frame by frame using the same method and concept as in those old days of paper and cels.

## How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora

Keyframes specify the start or end of a transition in a shot. A series of keyframes can give the semblance of the movement of an object. Keyframes include parameters such as Position, Scale, Opacity, and Rotation. These values can be changed and customized to make animations using keyframing.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) makes it really easy to use. Even learners or novices can use keyframe animation to create extraordinary videos. Plus, the keyframe templates are an added satisfaction. If you have limited time and need a quick fix, using Presets in the Animation tab is your best bet.

For this example, we'll walk you through using Keyframes on the short video clip to make your Animation using Wondershare Filmora.
