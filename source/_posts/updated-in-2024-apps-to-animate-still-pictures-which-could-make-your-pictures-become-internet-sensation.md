The images must be captioned, the movement of the camera must be shown with arrows, and the object and characters must be differentiated from the background with colors.

## Part 1: Preparation

#### 1\. Script is the Essence

If you wish to understand the nuances of how to make an animation, the first step you should know is scripting.

Playing with the words in your mind and weaving them on paper makes a big difference. So, penning a story helps you to recognize the loopholes, the pace, and the character development in your story.

The script gives a person an idea of where your story is based, how does it look or at which time of the day are you talking about, who is talking to whom, and most importantly, the dialogues, what are your story characters say to one another. The script is the essence of creating animation and without it, you cannot resume the process of animation.

#### 2\. Storyboarding

What is storyboarding? It is a sequence of images or pre-visualization of movie shots to understand how exactly the story will unveil, the feel, the look, the camera angles, everything is described like a flowchart.

Storyboarding can be of various types. It may be colorful, it may just an outline, or black and white or something with complete detail. A storyboard must give a complete and close image of what the movie would look like.

The images must be captioned, the movement of the camera must be shown with arrows, and the object and characters must be differentiated from the background with colors.

#### 3\. Voiceover

If you want to make your animation more vivid and interesting, remember to add voiceover. Would you like to see an animated movie without a voice? It is a vital part of any movie recording.

When you ask how to make an animation, you also need to know how to record a voiceover. The animation is influenced by voice performance for focus and timing of a scene. The animated scene and the voiceover must be in sync perfectly in order to retain the attention of the viewers.

In the earlier days, a recording studio used to be rented and a sound engineer and voiceover artist was hired for it. But, today the auditions for VO are done online and the best one with professional recording tools is hired.

In this step, it is important to select and assemble the recorded sounds and start preparing the final mix of the sound in order to ensure proper lip sync and other sound effects needed for the final animation film.

Any heavy unwanted sounds are removed and significant spot sounds are added while mixing the pre-determined soundtrack.

## Part 3: Edit and Export

#### 6\. Final Editing

Often the scenes for the animation film are randomly shot. There are a number of scenes that are shot just as a back up so that later while editing it can be checked and the best shot from many can be picked to include in the movie. All such things are finally checked in the final editing. It is the process of rearranging the clips so that the end product is flawless. Other editing task includes the addition of effects in the clips or text used in titling, etc.

Exporting the animated movie is the last step in creating an animation. How to make an animation is no more a big reason for headache. If you want, you may also share it directly on the social media platforms with your friends and viewers.

## Part 2 Make your Own Animated Love GIFs with Music

Since the above-listed websites for I Love You anime GIFs can be a bit generic, you can consider coming up with some unique media of your own. To do that, I would recommend using Wondershare Filmora, which is a user-friendly and feature-equipped media editing tool.

If you want, you can readily import images, GIFs, videos, music, and other media files on Filmora. Besides that, the application also features a wide range of assets related to sound effects, images, and more that you can readily use. To come up with some interesting, I Love You animated GIFs using Filmora, follow this drill:

#### Step 1: Load your Media Files from your System

Once Wondershare Filmora is installed, you can launch it on your system and go to its Menu > File > Import to load your photos, videos, and so on. You can also drag and drop them to the interface of Filmora.
