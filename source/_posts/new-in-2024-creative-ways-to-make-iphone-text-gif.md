## Part 2 How to Text a GIF on an iPhone Using a Third-Party App

Sending a GIF from an iPhone is also possible using third-party applications such as GIF Keyboard and GIPHY. These applications are built to add character to text messaging using animated objects called GIFs. Adding a GIF to your texts usually brings in some humor and life. You must have downloaded them from App Store and installed them on your iPhone to use these applications.

You can also visit third-party websites to send GIFs from there. For example, GIPHY supports searching and sending GIFs via iMessage.

Here are the steps to follow to search and send **GIFs on iPhone text** messages on iMessage using third-party tools:

**Step 1**: Search for your desired GIF on GIPHY or other GIF websites.
