**●** Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.

**●** Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.

**●** Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called "Repousse". By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space

**●** Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Batman is one of the most popular and long-lasting characters in DC animated movies. There can always be an argument on Marvel and DC movies. Although, DC remains the king regards to animated movies. DC animated movies are better coordinated with live-action scenes. Each story features different aspects of Gotham city and its issues.

Batman or "Bruce Wayne" is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time. I could even say, in the early 90s, Batman was the most favorite hero of DC animated movies.

The top of the list is Dark Knight Returns anime. What makes this animated Batman so exceptional are his rules and consciousness. Batman goes beyond his limits to save his beloved city. But on top of all, Batman avoids making a public appearance. The movie is entertaining and less dark scenes, mostly targeting the younger generation.

However, when Gotham becomes the prey of mafias, gang wars, and Joker, Batman comes out of retirement or what looked like a retirement. Although Batman was criticized by the public and even hunted by authorities, he still came back, making him the "Dark Knight." However, in the end, it seems that Bruce Wayne dies, but still, the true fate of Batman is unknown.

![dark knight returns](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-dark-knight-returns.jpg)

### 2\. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm

This animated movie is more or less about the journey of the orphan Bruce Wayne to Batman. It demonstrates his childhood life and how he plans to become a masked vigilante. Unable to make sense of the tragedy, Bruce tries to stop robberies and thefts. Thus, trying to control his anger but couldn't make much impact. This dark, grim, and thrilling anime is one of the finest anime movies.

In the meantime, he becomes deeply attached to Andrea Beaumont, who could somewhat console him. However, she leaves Bruce all broken. Bruce mysteriously leaves his beloved home city in a quest to find the true purpose of his life and comebacks as a symbol of hope for his beloved city.

### 3\. Batman: Subzero

Mr. Freeze, who is the ex-enemy of Batman, finds himself in a devastating position. A tragic accident puts his wife in a life-and-death situation. Being heartbroken, Mr. Freeze comes back to Gotham city only to find out that Barbara Gordan can only save his wife.

He kidnaps Barbara and on-bards her on the plan to save his wife. In the meantime, Batman and Robbin learn the whereabouts of Barbara. Batman rescues Barbara while pledging Mr. Freeze to save his dying wife. This demonstrates the perfect example of how high Batman holds justice and rules.

![Batman Subzero](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-Batman-Subzero.jpg)

### 4\. Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker

Joker is the most despised enemy of all. He knows Batman too well and even has some instincts about his identity. On top of that, Joker isn't much afraid of Batman.
