Filmora Meme Maker is the right choice for you if you want to [add text to the GIFs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you create.

#### 2\. What are GIFs made of?

GIFs consist of a series of pictures that simulate a movement, and they can either be comprised of still or moving images.

In case you want to create a GIF out of photos, you will have to take a number of consecutive photos with your camera and then merge them into a GIF. The number of photos you will have to take depends on the duration of the GIF you want to create, and it varies from just five to more than one thousand.

Optionally, you can also create GIFs from video files, but you should keep in mind that the sound is going to be removed automatically, as GIF files cannot contain audio.

02 [How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?](#Part 2)

03 [Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's Adobe Auto Rigger?**

Alright, so what is the **Adobe Auto Rigger** and how does it differ from **Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging** or **Adobe After Effects Rigging**? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.

It's all thanks to the third-party tool, **Mixamo**, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually **rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects**.) We'll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.

Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you're intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)

![Adobe Auto Rigger Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome1.png)

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

![Upload Custom Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome2.png)

### 02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters

The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters' tab (shown in the image below.)

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

![Browse for Auto-Rigged Characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome3.png)

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

![Adobe 3D Rigging with Mixamo Adobe Auto Rigger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome4.png)

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

![Upload Custom Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome2.png)

### 02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters

The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters' tab (shown in the image below.)

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

![Browse for Auto-Rigged Characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome3.png)

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

![Adobe 3D Rigging with Mixamo Adobe Auto Rigger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome4.png)

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

The **Adobe Auto rigger** is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of **Adobe 3D Rigging**.) It's a perfect tool for beginners.

Especially those that aren't really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.

If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

#### In this article

01 [All You Need to Know About 2D Rigging](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Difference and Connection Between 2D and 3D](#Part 2)

03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

![2D Character Looking at a Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you2.png)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

#### In this article

01 [All You Need to Know About 2D Rigging](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Difference and Connection Between 2D and 3D](#Part 2)

03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

![2D Character Looking at a Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you2.png)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)
