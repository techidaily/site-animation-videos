 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

Even though girls are usually displayed as cute and pinkish and lovely, some animes display them as creepy. And believe me, these creepy anime girls have a huge fan base and are capable of giving the audience a chill over the spine while watching them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

* [1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)](#part1)
* [2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)](#part2)
* [3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)](#part3)
* [4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)](#part4)
* [5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)](#part5)

### 1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

![hell-girl-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hell-girl-scary-anime.jpg)

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

There is too much to the story, and saying more about it may reveal the suspense. The story is filled with horror and adventure, and the character of Shion absorbs some of the darkness of the town, which gives a scary impact on the audience.

![higurashi-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-higurashi-scary-anime.jpg)

### 3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)

Sachiko from Corpse Party is a friendly-looking but scary character who loves to rip out the tongues of some of her fellow characters. She tortures students in Heavenly Host Elementry School which is a living hell in the anime.

Sachiko unleashes a lot of horror in the series and she plays the part of an elementary school ghost breaking all the expectations of the audience. Torturing her fellow mates and cutting their tongues out before death is something that makes Sachiko a perfect scary anime girl.

![corpse-party-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-corpse-party-scary-anime.jpg)

### 4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)

Shiro, the creepy-looking girl from Deadman Wonderland is another character to be scared of. She was adopted for the only purpose of being used as a human experiment in her childhood. The experiments instilled a very scary character in her which gives a horror nature to the anime in total.

The experiments on here were very painful and multiple personalities called "The Wretched Egg" were developed by her to cope up with torture. The creepy nature and the use of her special skills to murder some characters in the anime and frame her adopted brother for it is very dark and scary.

![shiro-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-shiro-scary-anime.jpg)

### 5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)

Megumi Shimizu of Shiki is a young girl and the first of all to be killed by the Kirishiki family. She was the first person who died who was not Yamairi and also the first to rise as Shiki.

After becoming a Shiki Megumi became very malicious and attacked the villagers. She enjoyed attacking them and that is very creepy. She also was ready to kill Tohru Mutou and Kaori’s father due to some small reasons. Her character without a drop of sympathy or care for the people around her is very scary and makes her very unpredictable.

![shiki-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-shiki-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)

Esdeath in Akame Ga Kill who is also known as the ice queen of the empire is a very manipulative character and a sadist. She follows the motto, the strong survive and the weak die, and justifies killing innocents and torturing enemies because of it.

Esdeath once made a prince who lost to strip naked before her and lick her boots, before killing his which is a different level of dark. She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.

![esdeath-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-esdeath-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)

Himiko is a cute-looking girl that possesses the ability to shapeshift to anything she wants. The creepy part is, in order to shapeshift she has to ingest another person’s blood.

Though Himiko appears to be a typical funny school girl, she can turn into a murderous beast in the blink of an eye. Her twister view of relationships and her trying to befriend people while trying to kill them at the same time all give us creepy chills while watching the anime.

![toga-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-toga-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)

Though Hana Midorikawa looks very cute and innocent she is as creepy as any girl can get. The story evolves in an underground prison school which is an explainable aspect that made Hana the sadist she is.

At first, Hana might seem to be a cute girl who does not belong at the place she currently is, but going deeper the opinion of the audience changes extremely. Hana happens to be a violent sociopath with a lot of dangerous thoughts and a urination fetish, and that is just the beginning of her creepiness.

![hana-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hana-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)

Isabella who is also known as Mama is one of the main characters in the Promised Land. Being a caretaker to children, though she appears to be loving and affectionate to her children, that’s not the real case.

Isabella has a twisted character and shows detachment to her tragedies. This character shows antagonism, betrayal, and a twisted nature enough for the fans to feel creepy about her.

![isabella-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-isabella-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)

Lucy in Elfen Lied is a character that sometimes gets sympathy and other times creeps the audience out. She has difficulty drawing a line between good and evil. She can be seen as being sadistically tormented and ruthlessly tormenting about the cruelty around her.

Her surroundings and the people are responsible for how she is and that is why despite being creepy she is loved by a lot of people.

![lucy-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-lucy-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### Final thoughts

Though most animes are fun to watch, horror animes are also enjoyed by a lot of people. The main aspect of these horror animes is the scary characters that make the audience wonder.

We have listed the top 10 scary anime girls of different animes that are equally liked and hated by the audience all over the world. The way they act, their cruelty, sadism all define their scary character. These scary anime girls have created such a huge impact that a fan might forget the anime name but never the name of the scary anime girl who gives him/her chills all over the body.

### 4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)

Shiro, the creepy-looking girl from Deadman Wonderland is another character to be scared of. She was adopted for the only purpose of being used as a human experiment in her childhood. The experiments instilled a very scary character in her which gives a horror nature to the anime in total.

The experiments on here were very painful and multiple personalities called "The Wretched Egg" were developed by her to cope up with torture. The creepy nature and the use of her special skills to murder some characters in the anime and frame her adopted brother for it is very dark and scary.

![shiro-scary-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-shiro-scary-anime.jpg)

### 5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)

Megumi Shimizu of Shiki is a young girl and the first of all to be killed by the Kirishiki family. She was the first person who died who was not Yamairi and also the first to rise as Shiki.

After becoming a Shiki Megumi became very malicious and attacked the villagers. She enjoyed attacking them and that is very creepy. She also was ready to kill Tohru Mutou and Kaori’s father due to some small reasons. Her character without a drop of sympathy or care for the people around her is very scary and makes her very unpredictable.

![shiki-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-shiki-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)

Esdeath in Akame Ga Kill who is also known as the ice queen of the empire is a very manipulative character and a sadist. She follows the motto, the strong survive and the weak die, and justifies killing innocents and torturing enemies because of it.

Esdeath once made a prince who lost to strip naked before her and lick her boots, before killing his which is a different level of dark. She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.

![esdeath-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-esdeath-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)

Himiko is a cute-looking girl that possesses the ability to shapeshift to anything she wants. The creepy part is, in order to shapeshift she has to ingest another person’s blood.

Though Himiko appears to be a typical funny school girl, she can turn into a murderous beast in the blink of an eye. Her twister view of relationships and her trying to befriend people while trying to kill them at the same time all give us creepy chills while watching the anime.

### 8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)

Though Hana Midorikawa looks very cute and innocent she is as creepy as any girl can get. The story evolves in an underground prison school which is an explainable aspect that made Hana the sadist she is.

At first, Hana might seem to be a cute girl who does not belong at the place she currently is, but going deeper the opinion of the audience changes extremely. Hana happens to be a violent sociopath with a lot of dangerous thoughts and a urination fetish, and that is just the beginning of her creepiness.

### 9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)

Isabella who is also known as Mama is one of the main characters in the Promised Land. Being a caretaker to children, though she appears to be loving and affectionate to her children, that’s not the real case.

### 10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)

Lucy in Elfen Lied is a character that sometimes gets sympathy and other times creeps the audience out. She has difficulty drawing a line between good and evil. She can be seen as being sadistically tormented and ruthlessly tormenting about the cruelty around her.

Her surroundings and the people are responsible for how she is and that is why despite being creepy she is loved by a lot of people.

Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

Even though girls are usually displayed as cute and pinkish and lovely, some animes display them as creepy. And believe me, these creepy anime girls have a huge fan base and are capable of giving the audience a chill over the spine while watching them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

* [1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)](#part1)
* [2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)](#part2)
* [3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)](#part3)
* [4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)](#part4)

### 1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

There is too much to the story, and saying more about it may reveal the suspense. The story is filled with horror and adventure, and the character of Shion absorbs some of the darkness of the town, which gives a scary impact on the audience.

## Part 1 How to Convert Video to GIF in Photoshop - Easy Way

If you want to **convert video to GIF** in Photoshop, here is a discussion of the easy way to go about it.

**Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right**

When you start to convert **mp4 to GIF using Photoshop**, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.

The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.

Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.

**Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop**

Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.

![import video photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly**

The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The "From Beginning to End" is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select "Selected Range Only." On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.

Last but not least, check the "Make Frame Animation" checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.

**Step 4: Edit the GIF**

Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF.
