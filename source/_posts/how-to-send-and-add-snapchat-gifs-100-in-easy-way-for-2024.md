### 02**PicMonkey**

When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Creative Bloq: 4/5\]

The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an **online photo animator** and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

Photo Cartoon is an **online photo animator** that specifically alters your photos and ‘cartoon-izes’ it (with several effects to choose from as to the specific style that you want).

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.2/5\]

With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced **online photo animator** tools. This one works quite simply as well though.

### 08**TheCartoonist.me**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.

**●** **Picture animator online** that allows you to turn your pictures into cartoon versions of their former self.

**●** Photo to Animation is quite a broad subject and, fittingly, that means that the tools that allow for it are varied indeed.

**●** Some photo to animation converters will allow you to completely change the look of your photograph with a single application of a filter. While others are more involved (and thus, more flexible) and require more careful customization.

**●** We’ve included both types (and all the types between) in our list of photo to animation converters. Hopefully, you’ll find one that can help you make the animated pictures that you want to make.

#### 1\. Can I Combine A Few Gifs?

Yes, you can. Any photo or [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that supports GIF file format allows you to combine one or more GIFs. For instance, Adobe Photoshop users can combine several GIF files and play them simultaneously next to each other, but this task can be overwhelming if you are not familiar with this photo editing software.

An online GIF combiner like Ezgif enables you to combine multiple GIFs from your web browser for free, which makes it a great option for anyone who doesn’t have access to a professional photo or video editing software.

#### 2\. How To Merge Several Animated GIFs?

Playing two or more GIFs one after another in a single file is easy, as you just have to arrange them in a way you want them to appear in the final version of the GIF on the editor’s timeline and then export your project as a GIF file.

What’s more, you will be able to remove the frames of the GIFs you don’t want to include in the output file or apply different filters and effects. However, the options you are going to have at your disposal depending on the GIF maker or video editing software you are using to merge several animated GIFs into a single file.
