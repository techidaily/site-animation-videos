Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing **Unity character rigging** as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.

Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)

03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?

To understand what **Unity rigging** is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.

You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.

Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.

Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is **animation rigging in Unity**. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.

The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.

Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as **unity rigging**. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.

## Part 2 Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?

Another platform that can ideally assist you in animation is Blender. A common question arises as to whether one should choose **blender rigging over Unity** or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.

| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |

| **Types Supported** | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |
| **Best Purpose**    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |

There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.

**●** Drawing

**●** Games

**●** In-Game Analytics

**●** Multi-player Gaming Network

**●** Player Management

**●** Virtual Reality

**●** IT Asset Management

**●** Prototype Creation

Therefore, it is preferred to opt for **Unity rigging** than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.

## Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity

Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in **unity rig animation**. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.

##### Step 1Installation

The first step is to install the "**animation rigging package" of Unity**. You will get the animation rigging package in the "Package Manager". You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.

This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called "runtime rigging".

The "Asset's Animator Root" consist of the "Rig Builder Component", which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create **Unity humanoid rig** that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.

![rig builder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-2.jpg)

##### Step 2Rig Builder set-up

After installing the **unity animation rigging package**, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the "Animator component" in this step. Using the "Animator component", integrate the "Rig Builder component" with the "GameObject". Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost "Transform".

Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the "Rig component". After this step, you need to access the "Animator root", where you will find the "Rig Builder component". In the "Rig Builder component", you need to assign the "Rig to the Rig Layers" list.

It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.

![rig builder set up unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-3.jpg)

##### Step 3Bone Rendering

Whether it is **unity rigging** or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The "Unity Editor" will help you interact and work with the character's skeleton in the "Scene view."

You can add "Transform" lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the "Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous "Bone Renderer" components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.

![bone rendering unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-4.jpg)

##### Step 4Adding Rig Effectors

This step enables one to add Gizmos to Transforms, facilitating selection and visualisation. The "Effector" are invisible during "Game View", and this step enhances the quality of the character animation.

![rig effects unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-5.jpg)

##### Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints

Your characters gain "runtime animation" through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.

![rig constraint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-6.jpg)

##### Step 6Working with the Two Bone IK Constraint

The first step here is to rest your character to the "Bind Pose." you can do so by opting for the "Menu Bar" and selecting the "Animation Rigging" option. You will find the "Bind Pose" option there, and you will have to click on it.

![bind pose unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-7.jpg)

Then add a child GameObject below "Character Rig". Then add a new child GameObject below "Right Arm IK". Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the "Right Arm Ik" by naming the first and the second one "RH IK Target" and "RH IK Hint", respectively.

![rh ik hint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-8.jpg)

Integrate the "Rig Builder Component" with the "Animator root GameObject". Then proceed with selecting the "CharecterRig GameObject" and integrating a "Rig Component". Select "Two Bone IK Contrainst" to the "Right Arm IK."

![rig component unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-9.jpg)

Then, incorporate a "Box Effector" to the RH IK Target. Integrate a "Ball Effector" to the "RH IK Hint".

![rh ik hint unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-10.jpg)

Then select the "RH IK Hint" and "Right Elbow". Select "Animation Rigging>align Transform". Move away from the "Ball Effector". Select the "Right Arm IK GameObject" and integrate the required bones. Integrate the Character Rig GameObkect with Rig Layer list by selecting the option of "Ninja". Then press "Play" and see your creation come to life.

Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is **animation rigging in Unity**. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.

The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.

Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as **unity rigging**. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.

There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.

**●** Drawing

**●** Games

**●** In-Game Analytics

**●** Multi-player Gaming Network

**●** Player Management

**●** Virtual Reality

**●** IT Asset Management

**●** Prototype Creation

Therefore, it is preferred to opt for **Unity rigging** than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.

## Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity

Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in **unity rig animation**. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.

##### Step 1Installation

The first step is to install the "**animation rigging package" of Unity**. You will get the animation rigging package in the "Package Manager". You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.

This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called "runtime rigging".

The "Asset's Animator Root" consist of the "Rig Builder Component", which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create **Unity humanoid rig** that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.

![rig builder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-2.jpg)

##### Step 2Rig Builder set-up

After installing the **unity animation rigging package**, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the "Animator component" in this step. Using the "Animator component", integrate the "Rig Builder component" with the "GameObject". Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost "Transform".

Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the "Rig component". After this step, you need to access the "Animator root", where you will find the "Rig Builder component". In the "Rig Builder component", you need to assign the "Rig to the Rig Layers" list.

It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.

![rig builder set up unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-3.jpg)

##### Step 3Bone Rendering

Whether it is **unity rigging** or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The "Unity Editor" will help you interact and work with the character's skeleton in the "Scene view."

You can add "Transform" lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the "Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous "Bone Renderer" components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.

![bone rendering unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-4.jpg)

##### Step 4Adding Rig Effectors

This step enables one to add Gizmos to Transforms, facilitating selection and visualisation. The "Effector" are invisible during "Game View", and this step enhances the quality of the character animation.

![rig effects unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-5.jpg)

##### Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints

Your characters gain "runtime animation" through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.

![rig constraint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-6.jpg)

##### Step 6Working with the Two Bone IK Constraint

The first step here is to rest your character to the "Bind Pose." you can do so by opting for the "Menu Bar" and selecting the "Animation Rigging" option. You will find the "Bind Pose" option there, and you will have to click on it.

![bind pose unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-7.jpg)

Then add a child GameObject below "Character Rig". Then add a new child GameObject below "Right Arm IK". Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the "Right Arm Ik" by naming the first and the second one "RH IK Target" and "RH IK Hint", respectively.

![rh ik hint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-8.jpg)

Integrate the "Rig Builder Component" with the "Animator root GameObject". Then proceed with selecting the "CharecterRig GameObject" and integrating a "Rig Component". Select "Two Bone IK Contrainst" to the "Right Arm IK."

![rig component unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-9.jpg)

Then, incorporate a "Box Effector" to the RH IK Target. Integrate a "Ball Effector" to the "RH IK Hint".

![rh ik hint unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-10.jpg)

## Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?

To understand what **Unity rigging** is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.

You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.

Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.

## Why use animation for business?

As we have earlier mentioned, animation is the key to attractive branding. According to Smart Insights' recent article on Video Marketing in 2020, around 92% of marketers feel this an essential part of business strategy. In contrast, 88% of marketers think that video marketing in animation offers them positive ROI.

We can describe to you a list of 5 reasons to use animation for business as follows.

#### It is fun and entertaining

Your animation doesn't need to be realistic or accurate. The purpose of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill fun and entertainment. The animation is a way to grab customers' attention rather than being used as a strict marketing tool. Customers will look over to the story more interesting than the traditional ad system.

#### Lasting impression

The animated videos for business leave a memorable impression on the current as well as new customers. However, you must be clear about using animation in a way that creatively tells about your business. A story that is too different from the business purpose may not be a good idea to create a lasting impression.

So, you must tell about the values you inject in a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the visuals and the information they get from it.

#### Boosts conversion rate

More than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content rather than getting you the high bounce off rates. So, you should beautifully explain the merits of your service or product to the user in animated videos for business. It's great if you add CTA at the end of the video.

#### Easy updates

Being a potent marketing tool animation for business is a new and updated aspect.

What you can do is check the overview of the brand from the customer's point of view. After that, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C.

#### Target Audience

There could be many reasons behind the same, such as gaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a new product or brand.

#### Market

Video promotion is the last but not least, step! You must know the ideas to market your videos before even starting the creation. The market can be Instagram or any other social media platform where you get a high presence of potential customers. Furthermore, the video should not be too pushy.

## What to Consider before Making Animated Business Videos?

The decision to make animated videos for business could be a tricky task even if you are aware of the importance, as mentioned above, of animation. Merely knowing the importance won't get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.

You need to implement the right strategies and know what factors are essential to look for before making animated videos for business. So, let's discuss those critical points!

#### Budget

The budget comes as the top-most factor because you can't do anything without enough money. So, be ready to invest a fair amount or at least invest in reliable video editing software. However, animation for business doesn't demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, using Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $49.99 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. However, it also depends upon the kind of job and style of business values you want to present in the animation. You have to outsource if it's expert-level work!

#### Brand Positioning

Consider your brand positioning! While using the animation for business, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values than mere visuals. They want to know your identity as a brand and your industry. It will help if you incorporate some brand positioning first before deciding to make animation videos for business. What you can do is check the overview of the brand from the customer's point of view. After that, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C.

#### Target Audience

Making animation videos about the target audience is essential, but it doesn't necessarily mean making videos only for them. The very first question is to ask why you are making such a video. There could be many reasons behind the same, such as gaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a new product or brand.

#### Market

Video promotion is the last but not least, step! You must know the ideas to market your videos before even starting the creation. The market can be Instagram or any other social media platform where you get a high presence of potential customers. Furthermore, the video should not be too pushy.

## How to make an animated business video?

You need to stay by the steps given below to create stunning animated videos for business.

#### Step 1: Video Script

Start by writing what you want to present in the form of a video script. To be clear, write it according to the direction and purpose of your video.

#### Step 2: Create a storyboard

You can implement the animation video-making process after creating a storyboard for your video. It is more of a way to visualize your video about different shots and scenarios.

You can use Animaker as an online storyboard tool.

#### Step 3: Choose the style of animation video

Select your particular kind of animation for business from the different types of animation videos given above.

Anime is an elaborate form of animation with its bright colors and vivid imagination. It is a modified version of animation as we know it in the West with a peculiar Japanese taste of art. Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.

Now, who is the **coolest anime character** in the history of anime, and what are **[10 popular cartoon characters that you won't want to miss](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the **best anime characters** in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.

## Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever

* [1\. Light Yagami (Death Note)](#part1)
* [2\. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)](#part2)
* [3\. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)](#part3)
* [4\. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)](#part4)
* [5\. Levi (Attack on Titan)](#part5)
* [6\. Saitama (One Punch Man)](#part6)

* [8\. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)](#part8)
* [9\. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)](#part9)
* [10\. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)](#part10)

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

## Final Words

Every anime character brings its feel and looks to the fictional world. As the vivid and ornate form of art, anime presents a different view of the world and the human mind's capabilities in creating such an intense augmentation of unreal to animated life.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

## Final Words

It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the **best anime characters** in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.

## Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever

* [1\. Light Yagami (Death Note)](#part1)
* [2\. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)](#part2)
* [3\. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)](#part3)
* [4\. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)](#part4)

* [8\. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)](#part8)
* [9\. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)](#part9)
* [10\. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)](#part10)

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.
