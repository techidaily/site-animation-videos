![how to draw your own cartoon character 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png)

![How to Animate Pictures in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-2.jpg)

#### Step 1: Add Static Elements

Start by creating an image through static elements. To make the design attractive, you can add sample texts, illustrations, doodles, and other entities.

Try to stimulate your creativity and come up with a layout beforehand. If possible, sketch on paper and replicate the same.

#### Step 2: Animate Your Design

Take a final glance at the layout. Make sure it's perfect. Once all the elements are placed as per your design, it's time to animate them. For that:

* Click on the white background page
* Go to the "Toolbar" section
* Select the "Animate" button

#### Step 3: Select Page Animation Style

Canva offers six animation styles, where five are for free users, and one is for pro users. To access the five animation styles, follow these steps.

* Press the "Animate" Button
* Select "Page Animations"
* There you will find options like Block, Pan, Fade, Rise, and Tumble
* Select the style as per your design

#### Step 4: Preview and Download

After selecting a page animation style, it will preview the effect. If you find it good, move on to downloading the GIF. Here's how to do so

* Go to the "Toolbar" option (present on your upper right hand)
* Choose GIF as the file type
* Check the page number and verify if it's correct
* Press the "Done" button

#### Step 5: Final GIF

After clicking on the "Done" button, your GIF will be downloaded. You will be able to see a display for five seconds. If you want to edit the image after this, click on the time button (near the "Animate" button).

So, that was all about how to animate a photo in Canva.

### **Drawbacks of Canva**

Despite efficient features and easy interface, there are certain areas where Canva lacks. This includes

* It does not have any local file storage.
* As too many people use Canva, your template may look the same as others.
* Some of its best features are not free to access.
* The mobile app version lacks certain elements and features.

Out of all these drawbacks, repetitions of templates are a big issue. That's because everyone wants their posts to look unique and irreplaceable. However, common Canva templates may prevent that from happening.

Fortunately, there are ways to combat such issues. Let's learn about them in the next section.

### For Win

#### Step 1： Adding Image to Video Track

With Filmora, adding images to video is a matter of seconds! Start by:

* Identify the position where you want to add the image and place the Playhead there.
* Right-click on the picture from the media library. Click on the "Insert" option. Your image will be added. Select the "Append" option, if you want to add an image at the video end.

**Note: How to Remove Black Bars around the Image?**

* Go to "Settings" from the File section.
* Click on the "Editing" tab and select "Photo Placement."
* Choose from the "Crop to Fit" or "Pan To Zoom" option. The black bars will be removed.

To add the image in between the video clip, split them. Now, add the image between the split parts.

#### Step 2： Add Images as Overlays

To add images as overlays, drag the image to a video track above the main track. The main track consists of your video.

Track 1 (or the track with a video clip) is the base of your video. If you add anything else, it will be displayed above this track as video track 2, 3, and so on. Overall, you can add 100 video tracks.

#### Step 3： Edit Your Image

If you know how to animate an image in Canva, editing images on Filmora is even easier. You can try the following methods:

**Animate Your Images**

* To add animation presets to the image, click on the image twice.
* Go to the "Animation Tab" and look for an animation preset.
* Drag the presets to the image for its effect

* Go to the "Color" tab and then the "Color" section
* Customize the temperature, saturation, brightness, etc., as per your need.
* Press Ok.

**Change Image Duration**

* Click on the image and select the "Duration" option.
* Go to the "Duration Setting" panel.
* Add the new duration timing.
