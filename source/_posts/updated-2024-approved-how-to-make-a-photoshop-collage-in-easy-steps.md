### 03**Adobe Creative Cloud Express**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Creative Bloq: 4/5\]

The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an **online photo animator** and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.

**●** Comes with a veritable library of templates, effects, and filters for advanced photo editing and photo animation.

### 04**ColorCinch**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Crozdesk: 4/5\]

ColorCinch, or Cartoonize, as it is also called, is another popular **online photo animator** that you might have heard about already. This one features quite a few presets that you can use to quickly change the look of your photographs.

**●** Photo editing functions for breathing new life into existing photographs.

**●** Presets, templates, filters, and effects are available for easy and efficient photo editing.

### 05**Photo Cartoon**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

Photo Cartoon is an **online photo animator** that specifically alters your photos and ‘cartoon-izes’ it (with several effects to choose from as to the specific style that you want). This single-use, while definitely not the most advanced on this list of ours, offers the user an easy way to change the look of their photographs.

**●** Transform photos into cartoons, paintings, drawings, and caricatures.

### 06**BeFunky**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.2/5\]

With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced **online photo animator** tools. This one works quite simply as well though. Similar to the previous tool we introduced, BeFunky is meant primarily for quickly and easily adding filters and effects to photographs to change its style to look more like a cartoon or animation.

**●** Create a cartoon version of your images easily and quickly.

### 07**7\. ASPOSE**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

Although not very well-known, ASPOSE is an easy way of animating pictures online. All you really have to do is upload your file (in the way that is suggested) and you're good to go. You’ll be given a choice in what kind of animations you want to put on your photograph thereafter. And, when the conversion is complete, it’ll be FREE to download and share.

### 08**TheCartoonist.me**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.

**●** **Picture animator online** that allows you to turn your pictures into cartoon versions of their former self.

### 09**Snapstouch**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Animation is quite a broad subject and, fittingly, that means that the tools that allow for it are varied indeed.

**●** Some photo to animation converters will allow you to completely change the look of your photograph with a single application of a filter. While others are more involved (and thus, more flexible) and require more careful customization.

**●** We’ve included both types (and all the types between) in our list of photo to animation converters. Hopefully, you’ll find one that can help you make the animated pictures that you want to make.
