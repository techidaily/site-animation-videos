## Part 2 Key Factors to Consider While Lip-syncing in Animations

To make the lip-syncing in your animation look perfect several factors need to be taken care of. Some of these important ones are enlisted below.

### 01 Perfect Match of the Keyframes

The keyframes for the shapes of the words phrase by phrase needs to be perfect to make it look right. The right lip sync will have the correct timings from the mouth open to the mouth close.

### 02 Adding Body Language

To make the characters in your animations look real and lively, adding gestures and body language will play a huge role. Moreover, lip-syncing along with facial expressions will add to the overall richness of the animations.

### 03 Watch Yourself or Record Sample Videos

To get the correct lip-syncing for your animations, you can first try and practice by using a mirror or recording some trial videos. In these videos, you can speak and observe the jaw motion.

### 04 Use Blending

The technique of blending can also be used where the focus is on the most important shape of the mouth rather than each syllable. These shapes can then be blended and used in different ways and combinations.

### 05 Emphasize Eyes

Eyes need special focus as they can be used for expressing several emotions. Especially during the close-up shots in animations, a person looks at the eyes before the rest of the face.

### 06 Use the Apt Voice

No matter how perfectly the lip-syncing is done, it will not look good if the voice does not match the characters in your animations. So, make sure to select the voice that matches the looks and the personality of your characters.
