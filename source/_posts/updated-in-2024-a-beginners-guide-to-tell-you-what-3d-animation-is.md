03 [Types of 3D Animations](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 3D Animation Software](#Part 4)

05 [Top Animation Tips and Tricks](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?

In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating **animation 3D models**.

The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.

## Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?

Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.

### 01Modeling

The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.

### 02Layout and animation

The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.

### 03Rendering

The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.

After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.

## Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?

In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating **animation 3D models**.

The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.

## Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?

Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.

### 01Modeling

The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.

### 02Layout and animation

The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.

### 03Rendering

The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.

After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.

To get the correct lip-syncing for your animations, you can first try and practice by using a mirror or recording some trial videos. In these videos, you can speak and observe the jaw motion.

### 04 Use Blending

The technique of blending can also be used where the focus is on the most important shape of the mouth rather than each syllable. These shapes can then be blended and used in different ways and combinations.

### 05 Emphasize Eyes

Eyes need special focus as they can be used for expressing several emotions. Especially during the close-up shots in animations, a person looks at the eyes before the rest of the face.

### 06 Use the Apt Voice

No matter how perfectly the lip-syncing is done, it will not look good if the voice does not match the characters in your animations. So, make sure to select the voice that matches the looks and the personality of your characters.
