The best part about cartoons is that there's something for everyone. There are **iconic cartoon characters** that are humorous, cute, and cool.

Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

**Created:** 1941  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** William Hanna and various other voices

The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer's theatrical short films.

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

![charlie brown and snoopy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-6.jpg)

**Created:** 1950  
**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz  
**Voice:** Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

![Scooby doo and shaggy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-8.png)

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

![winnie the pooh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-9.jpg)

**Created:** 1926  
**Creators:** A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard  
**Voice:** Sterling Holloway. Hal Smith. Jim Cummings

The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.

Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children's books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie's friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.

### 10Pinky & the Brain

![pinky and the brain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-10.jpg)

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![powerpuff girls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-11.jpg)

**Created:** 1998  
**Creator:** Craig McCracken  
**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** Cartoons give valuable lessons about life. People of all ages can benefit from these life lessons. While comics typically target children, this does not rule out the possibility that adults will like them. There is a slew of animated sitcoms aimed squarely at adults! This means that individuals of all ages can enjoy and love cartoons.

**●** Thus, we listed the **most iconic cartoon characters** that made your childhood more exciting. So, enjoy your choice of **iconic cartoon characters** and have fun.

New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

**Created:** 1941  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** William Hanna and various other voices

The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer's theatrical short films.

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

![charlie brown and snoopy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-6.jpg)

**Created:** 1950  
**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz  
**Voice:** Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

![Scooby doo and shaggy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-8.png)

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

![winnie the pooh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-9.jpg)

**Created:** 1926  
**Creators:** A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard  
**Voice:** Sterling Holloway. Hal Smith. Jim Cummings

The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.

Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children's books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie's friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.

### 10Pinky & the Brain

![pinky and the brain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-10.jpg)

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![powerpuff girls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-11.jpg)

**Created:** 1998  
**Creator:** Craig McCracken  
**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** Cartoons give valuable lessons about life. People of all ages can benefit from these life lessons. While comics typically target children, this does not rule out the possibility that adults will like them. There is a slew of animated sitcoms aimed squarely at adults! This means that individuals of all ages can enjoy and love cartoons.

**●** Thus, we listed the **most iconic cartoon characters** that made your childhood more exciting. So, enjoy your choice of **iconic cartoon characters** and have fun.

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

## Final Words

Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.

Now, who is the **coolest anime character** in the history of anime, and what are **[10 popular cartoon characters that you won't want to miss](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the **best anime characters** in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.

## Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever

* [1\. Light Yagami (Death Note)](#part1)
* [2\. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)](#part2)
* [3\. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)](#part3)
* [4\. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)](#part4)
* [5\. Levi (Attack on Titan)](#part5)
* [6\. Saitama (One Punch Man)](#part6)

* [8\. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)](#part8)
* [9\. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)](#part9)
* [10\. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)](#part10)

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.

### 05Marketing To Medical Professional

While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.

A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry.

## Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations

3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.

### 01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients

Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his/her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.

### 02Training Of Medical Professionals

Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures.

For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.

### 04Used As A Marketing Tool

## Part 1 **Should You Study 3D Animation?**

![learning 3d animation 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginners-guide-for-learning-3d-animation-02.jpg)

3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with **3D animation courses online for free** to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.

As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:

**●** Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.

**●** 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.

**●** 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.

You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:

**●** **Modeling:** The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding.

Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form.

## Part 1 **Should You Study 3D Animation?**

![learning 3d animation 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginners-guide-for-learning-3d-animation-02.jpg)

3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with **3D animation courses online for free** to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.

As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:

**●** Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.

**●** 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.

**●** 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.

You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:

**●** **Modeling:** The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to **learn 3D animation and graphic design courses**.

## Part 2 **Top 5 Programs for 3D Animation**

If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

#### In this article

01 [All You Need to Know About 2D Rigging](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Difference and Connection Between 2D and 3D](#Part 2)

03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

![Storyboard Creation. Creating 2D & 3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you3.png)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

02 [Best 12 Illusion Gifs](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?

GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.

Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.

These are now used as everything from advertisements to commentary from all walks of life. The users of GIFs seem to be endless! They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.

## Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs

This curated list will help you to know the best **Illusion GIF** that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-

### 01Van Gogh Stare GIF

The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the "dazzle camouflage," is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye's instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.

### 02This brain-busting rotation

We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can't see it from every angle.

### 03This loop tea GIF

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/meme-image-know-K79kKDx86GMik)

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE)

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj)

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik)

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

01 [What Is GIF Illustration?](#Part 1)

02 [Best 12 Illusion Gifs](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?

GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.

Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.

They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.

## Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs

This curated list will help you to know the best **Illusion GIF** that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-

### 01Van Gogh Stare GIF

The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the "dazzle camouflage," is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye's instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.

### 02This brain-busting rotation

We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can't see it from every angle.

### 03This loop tea GIF

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.
