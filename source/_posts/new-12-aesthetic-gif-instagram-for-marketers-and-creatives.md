## Conclusion

If you're wondering why you should chose whiteboard animation over the conventional video creating technique, then you should probably try it out. Animation easily captures the interest of viewers and the slide-by-slide transitioning equally makes it better. You can always try out other software applications to know the one that fits you best.

How to Create Your Video

Step1 The first step to creating your whiteboard animation video is to **know your topic of choice**. Determining your choice topic is based on the purpose of the video. You have to know the reason why the video is being created in the first place to enable you decide the contents, the outlook, the font style and size and the colors to use.

Step2 The next step after you've getting your topic is execution of the idea. This involves having a script which usually involves the step-by-step procedure you are to follow to achieve your goal. Writing the script is arguable the most difficult process. However, once you get it right, all the other processes become relatively easy to execute. You might need to employ a professional script writer depending on your budget for the project.

Step3 After that, the next thing is to deicide whether or not to use your own voice or computer voice. This is also called a voice over. Most software provides a text to speech voice over option which usually comes with various alternatives. There is also another option of using your own voice to finish the project.

Step4 Add text, graphics and animation. This step is usually easier when you are working with the script already provided. You include the text, animations, figures, etc. sometimes you might need to import additional resources to complete this task. However, not all software provides for this.

Step5 Organize your work. In organizing your work, you must ensure that you voice over matches properly with what is on display. Check your spellings, grammar, composition and other ‘little' details that may give your work a bad look.

Step6 Save your work and export. Once your done with your work, you have to save it on your local disk. This also means downloading the work from the website or software onto a local disk. You can now share the video on any social media of your choice. The most popular place to share it is on YouTube which is the most widely used video watching application.
