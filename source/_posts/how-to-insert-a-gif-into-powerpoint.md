Just last year, the old-school animated slapstick comedy, **Animaniacs** was revived and given new life. This **Animaniacs reboot** was a long-time in coming for many fans of the show in the 1990s. In any case, **the Animaniacs (2020)** has inspired many fans of animated movies to start to rewatch their favorites shows in the past couple of decades.

Today, in order to give these fans something to be excited over, we've compiled a list of some of the Best Animated TV shows from Disney

Alright, let's kick things off with our list As mentioned, this will be a comprehensive list of some of the best **Disney Animated Shows** that you can watch right now We've ordered them by popularity so that you can have an easier time trying to figure out what to watch

Of course, if you're more interested in actually learning about how to create your own animated shows, you may be interested in looking in a different direction For that, we recommend looking towards the premium video editor, **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** — which comes packed with everything that you can possibly want in order to begin exploring the realm of animation

## Top 10 **Star vs. the Forces of Evil**

**Duration**: 2015–2019 \[4 Seasons, 22m per episode\]

**Genre**: Animation, Action, Adventure

**Rating**: TV-Y7

**Metascore**: N/A

**Director**: Aaron Hammersley, Dominic Bisignano, Brett Varon, Sabrina Cotugno, Piero Piluso, Tyler Chen, Giancarlo Volpe, David Wasson, Michael Mullen , John Davis Infantino, and Amelia Lorenz.

**Stars**: 7.9

**Votes**: 13,266

**Summary:** The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, 'Star vs. the Forces of Evil' This is an American animated 'magical-girl' television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)

The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand — only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully

## Top 9   **Gargoyles**

**Duration**: 1994–1996 \[2 Seasons, 30m per episode\]

**Genre**: Animation, Action, Adventure

**Director**: Dennis Woodyard, Frank Paur, Kazuo Terada, Saburo Hashimoto, Bob Kline, Takamitsu Kawamura, and Butch Lukic.

**Stars**: 8.1

**Votes**: 15,813

**Summary:** We go back into the older **Disney animated shows** a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called 'Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles' instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action/adventure show.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.

## Top 8 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

**Genre**: Animation, Adventure, Comedy

**Rating**: TV-Y

**Metascore**: N/A

**Director**: Donovan Cook, Howy Parkins, Sherie Pollack, Rob LaDuca, Phil Weinstein, Broni Likomanov, and Victor Cook.

**Stars**: 5.8

**Votes**: 3,364

**Summary:** The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse sees the revival of the classic, Mickey Mouse character (who had been snubbed an extended spot on the big screen outside of the previews and was really only featured in the old film 'Fantasia) The show was a long-running one. Having aired between 2006 to 2016 with exactly 125 episodes around 30 minutes long.

The demographics for this one mainly comprises of very young children. But, if you like, it's a safe-for-viewing show that you can have your kids watch and keep distracted And, perhaps, along the way, you can find some joy in these classic characters coming back to life.

## Top 7 **A Goofy Movie**

**Duration**: 1995 \[78 min\]

**Genre**: Animation, Adventure, Comedy

**Rating**: G

**Metascore**: N/A

**Director**: Kevin Lima

**Stars**: 6.9

**Votes**: 51,043

**Summary:** The Goofy Movie is not actually a TV show, but it is a part of the list of the best **Disney animated shows** on IMDB because it was based on an established television series called 'Goof Troop' The movie saw its premiere in 1995 and it starts off a couple of years after the end of the Goof Troop show.

Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show. It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it's not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it's sure to provide a good time

## Top 6 **Monsters at Work**

**Duration**: 2021– \[1 Season, 22m per episode\]

**Genre**: Animation, Adventure, Comedy

**Rating**: TV-G

**Metascore**: N/A

**Director**: Stephen J. Anderson, Kaitlyn Ritter, Kathleen Thorson Good, and Shane Zalvin.

**Stars**: 7.1

**Votes**: 5,862

**Summary:** When people talk of the best-animated films of all time, they usually do not forget to mention Monsters, Inc And well, this next show on our list, 'Monsters at Work', is meant to be a direct adaptation of the original work This series launched just last year (in 2021) and is currently ongoing and available for streaming on Disney+.

It kicks off on the day the main villain of the original story, Henry J. Waternoose III was arrested. Think of the show as a sequel, one that covers the inevitable transition of power with beloved characters Mike and Sulley at the helm

## Top 5 **DuckTales**

**Duration**: 2017–2021 \[3 Seasons, 21m per episode\]

**Genre**: Animation, Action, Adventure

**Rating**: TV-Y

**Metascore**: N/A

**Director**: Matthew Humphreys, Tanner Johnson, Jason Zurek, John Aoshima, Dana Terrace, Tom Owens, Matt Youngberg, Vince Aparo, Jason Reicher, Stephanie Gonzaga, and Sam King.

**Stars**: 8.2

**Votes**: 8,826

**Summary:** Next up, we have 'Duck Tales' Duck Tales is actually a reboot, much like the **Animianics (2020)** reboot The original series, which had premiered all the way back in September of 1987, had run for over 100 episodes (with the last of the episodes having been aired in November of 1990). In any case, the nostalgia factor is strong with this one The series has inspired many adaptations. And, with its revival on Disney XD in 2015, its popularity has only continued to grow

Just in case you're unfamiliar with this zany cast of characters. It all starts off with Donald Duck, who kicks off the show by joining the US Navy and handing off the care of his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie to his uncle Scrooge McDuck

**Summary:** The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, 'Star vs. the Forces of Evil' This is an American animated 'magical-girl' television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)

The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

**Summary:** We go back into the older **Disney animated shows** a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called 'Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles' instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action/adventure show.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.

**Genre**: Animation, Adventure, Comedy

**Rating**: G

**Metascore**: N/A

Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show. It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it's not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it's sure to provide a good time

In any case, the nostalgia factor is strong with this one The series has inspired many adaptations. And, with its revival on Disney XD in 2015, its popularity has only continued to grow

Just in case you're unfamiliar with this zany cast of characters. It all starts off with Donald Duck, who kicks off the show by joining the US Navy and handing off the care of his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie to his uncle Scrooge McDuck

This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn't make it any less fun

**Summary:** While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), 'The Owl House' is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)

The story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.

04 [One-Stop Solution to Edit High-Quality Videos in Every Situation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?

### 1\. Start With a Script

If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It'll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg)

If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you'll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you'll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.

### 2\. Record the Voiceover

The next step in our **Adobe Animate character tutorial** is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.

![voice over](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg)

Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.

### 3\. Start Creating the Character

At this point in our **Adobe animate character tutorial**, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you'll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it'll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.

![character development in animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg)

Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you'll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.

If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it'll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.

## Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?

If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you'll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you'll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.

### 2\. Record the Voiceover

If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it'll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.
