### 03A step-by-step breakdown of this process has been provided below (pictures included)

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

### 0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg)

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.

Works with most skin tones.

Better hair/accessory integration.

##### Cons

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

**Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style**

FREE Snapchat lens.

Works with all skin tones.

Works with accessories.

More of a cartoon animated style than anime.

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

Okay, first off What even is this **anime filter** everyone is talking about and how can you use it to **turn yourself into an animated character**? We've attached a helpful YouTube Video below from @Kapwing who has a more comprehensive explanation for you.

All you have to do is turn it on, and it'll turn you into the most fitting anime character of your style immediately

### 02How to Get the TikTok Anime Filter?

Now to finally get down to business How exactly can you get the **anime filter** for your TikTok? Well, here's the trick Despite having earned its popularity on TikTok, the **Anime Style** filter actually comes from Snapchat So, if you do want to animate yourself like you've seen all the other popular TikTok-ers do, you'll need to record the video (or take the picture) on the Snapchat App first and then upload it to TikTok.

### 03A step-by-step breakdown of this process has been provided below (pictures included)

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

### 0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character

**Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg)

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.

Works with most skin tones.

Better hair/accessory integration.

##### Cons

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

**Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-07.jpg)

Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called **Cartoon Style** This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo & Stitch, etc.), but it doesn't make it any less fun

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens.

Works with all skin tones.

Works with accessories.

##### Cons

More of a cartoon animated style than anime.

Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.

Not great at capturing motion.

**Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter**

![Anime Filter from TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-08.jpg)

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

Not the best with skin tones.

It doesn't use the classic Japanese-animation style.

This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before' and ‘after' (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.

**Anime Filter #4: Anime Eyes**

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

**Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-07.jpg)

Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called **Cartoon Style** This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo & Stitch, etc.), but it doesn't make it any less fun

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens.

Works with all skin tones.

Works with accessories.

##### Cons

More of a cartoon animated style than anime.

Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.

Not great at capturing motion.

**Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter**

![Anime Filter from TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-08.jpg)

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

Not the best with skin tones.

It doesn't use the classic Japanese-animation style.

This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before' and ‘after' (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

04 [One-Stop Solution to Edit High-Quality Videos in Every Situation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?

### 1\. Start With a Script

If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It'll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg)

If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you'll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you'll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.

### 2\. Record the Voiceover

The next step in our **Adobe Animate character tutorial** is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.

![voice over](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg)

Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.

### 3\. Start Creating the Character

At this point in our **Adobe animate character tutorial**, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you'll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it'll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.

![character development in animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg)

Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you'll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.

If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it'll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.

## Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?

That's how you can animate a character in Adobe character animator and create visually stunning animations. However, many beginners want to know if it's easy to use Adobe character animator. The answer is Yes! With Character Animator, Adobe has developed a relatively easy-to-use interface that anyone can use easily.

## Part 1 How Do I Animate a Character in Adobe Animation?

### 1\. Start With a Script

If you want to create an animation that engages the customers, you must always start your journey with a script. Like a short movie, even an animated sketch requires a script. It'll set the tone for the entire animation and help you start sailing in the right direction.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-01.jpg)

If you have a full production team, the writers will take care of scriptwriting and you'll just have to suggest a few changes in between. But, if you are working on your own, you'll have to handle the script writing all-by-yourself. In any case, however, make sure to start by crafting a beautiful script with an amazing storyline.

### 2\. Record the Voiceover

The next step in our **Adobe Animate character tutorial** is recording the voiceover for the video. Unless you are planning to create a GIF animation, you would need a dedicated voiceover for your animated video to make it more appealing.

![voice over](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-02.jpg)

Now, before you even begin with animating the character, recording the audio will help you clear out one task from the list. To record the voiceover, you can try different types of audio recording software and equipment.

### 3\. Start Creating the Character

At this point in our **Adobe animate character tutorial**, we are ready to design the actual character itself. To do this, launch Adobe Character Animator on your system. On its home screen, you'll see a tab containing different types of characters (along with their dedicated Photoshop and Illustrator versions). Click on any of these characters and it'll automatically open in the editing panel of Adobe character animator.

![character development in animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/secret-shortcut-to-adobe-animate-character-tutorial-03.jpg)

Now, you can start with animating the character. In the top-left corner, you'll see two different options, i.e., “<Character Name> Photoshop” and “<Character Name> Scene”. The Photoshop version of the file will let you adjust different elements of the character and customize its design. The latter, on the other hand, will actually let you develop the scene itself.

If you double-tap the “Scene” tab the character will open up in a real-time environment where it'll react to your movement and speech. Make sure that the webcam stays turned on throughout the process. Then, simply press the “Record” button and start recording the entire scene for your animation.

## Part 2 Is Adobe Character Animator Easy to Use?

That's how you can animate a character in Adobe character animator and create visually stunning animations. However, many beginners want to know if it's easy to use Adobe character animator. The answer is Yes! With Character Animator, Adobe has developed a relatively easy-to-use interface that anyone can use easily.

## Part 1 What is an Animated Sticky Navbar?

To put it in simple words, an **animated sticky navbar** is a dedicated header that stays fixed on the website, irrespective of the web page you're accessing. Ideally, designers use a sticky navbar to allow website visitors to visit any web page within 2-3 clicks.

The **animated navbar** also incorporates a few animations that uplift the overall visual appearance of the website. It doesn't matter if you are planning to design an e-commerce store or a simple service-based website, the animated navbar will allow you to make your website more user-friendly for the end-users.

## Part 2 What Are the Benefits of An Animated Sticky Navbar?

Now, there are endless benefits of using an **animated sticky navbar** on your website. However, these are a few factors that make **animated sticky navbars** the most useful on-page element of a website.

### 01Quick Navigation

As we mentioned earlier, easy navigation is one of the key features of a sticky navbar. You can place links to all the other web pages within the navbar in the form of drop-down menus and ensure that users can visit any webpage within a single click. This will enhance the overall user experience and you'll be able to encourage one-time visitors to spend more time on your website. Using the navbar will also improve your search engine rankings because the search engine crawler will be able to crawl all the web pages easily.

### 02Aesthetically Pleasing

The way your website looks has a huge impact on whether you're going to retain the website visitors or not. An **animated sticky navbar** will make your website look aesthetically pleasing and captivate the visitors more effectively. You can add different animations and visual elements to the navbar and make them match your website's overall color scheme.

### 03Better User Experience

Another reason why you would want to place an **animated sticky navbar** on your website is that it'll uplift the overall user experience for the website visitors. From finding easy navigation to all the web pages to ensuring that all the web pages offer the same browsing experience, a navbar will make your website engaging and it'll become easier to captivate the users.

## Part 3 8 Fixed Sticky Navbars That'll Grab Your Attention

So, now that you are familiar with the benefits of **animated sticky navbars**, here are the top examples that explain the best ways to use navigation bars on a website.

### 01Search Engine Journal

![search engine journal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-create-an-animated-sticky-navbar-01.JPG)

Search Engine Journal is an online knowledge hub where users can find every bit of information about digital marketing. The website publishes regular guides on SEO, PPC, Social Media Marketing, etc to help people get detailed insight into the benefits of digital marketing.

Since there are thousands of articles on the website, it could easily get chaotic for users to find the guide they are looking for. But, with an easy-to-navigate **animated sticky navbar**, Search Engine Journal has divided all the articles into their respective categories using simple drop-down menus

### 02AirBnB

![AirBnB](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-create-an-animated-sticky-navbar-02.JPG)

Airbnb is one of the most popular platforms to find vacation homes in a different city/country to enjoy your holiday in complete comfort. One of the major reasons behind AirBnB's immense success is its high-quality and easy-to-use website.

As you continue to scroll down the website, the sticky navbar stays fixed at the top with a dedicated search bar and a “Become a Host” Call-to-Action button. This way it doesn't matter if a user is looking for a place to rent or simply wants to become a host, they'll be able to get the job done within a few clicks.

### 03Graz Secrets

Graz Secrets is the perfect example of how you can use a sticky bar in the simplest manner and still grab users' attention easily. The website uses a black-colored simple navigation bar with a “Download Now” button at the center. The button continues to illuminate due to the background animation even if you scroll to the end of the web page. The overall black design of the navbar adds more visual factors to the website and engages the visitors more effectively.

### 04Adobe

Adobe's navigation bar is also a great example of how to use sticky navbars to uplift the overall user experience for website visitors. Even though the website doesn't stay at its place when you scroll down, it immediately comes back as soon as you scroll up once.

Moreover, the navbar has links to all the Adobe products, which means users can visit any product page they want right away. It's also worth understanding that Adobe has added a dedicated “Sign-in” button in the navigation bar to allow visitors to sign in to the Adobe cloud account straightaway.

### 05Daniel Filler

Daniel Filler's website uses the navigation bar in the simplest way possible - yet manages to draw the viewers' attention without any hassle. The designers have placed a pretty small navigation bar with links to all the important web pages.

The smaller size of the navigation bar doesn't make the website look cluttered and still manages to do its job easily. In addition to this, the designers have also placed a dedicated logo and the “Up” button to allow users to directly go to the top of the web page with one click.

### 06Mind Inventory

There are dedicated links to other web pages as well. However, you won't find any drop-down menus. In case your website also has limited web pages, you can also replicate this **animated sticky navbar** to make it more appealing.

### 08H&M
