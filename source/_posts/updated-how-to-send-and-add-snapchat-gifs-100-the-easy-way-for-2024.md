## Part 1 Let's Figure out What's Anime Filter First

### 01What is the Anime Filter on TikTok?

Okay, first off What even is this **anime filter** everyone is talking about and how can you use it to **turn yourself into an animated character**? We've attached a helpful YouTube Video below from @Kapwing who has a more comprehensive explanation for you.

But, as for the basics? It works just like most filters in that it can be used in both video and picture mode (allowing you to also **make your own animated profile picture** if you'd like). All you have to do is turn it on, and it'll turn you into the most fitting anime character of your style immediately

### 02How to Get the TikTok Anime Filter?

Now to finally get down to business How exactly can you get the **anime filter** for your TikTok? Well, here's the trick Despite having earned its popularity on TikTok, the **Anime Style** filter actually comes from Snapchat So, if you do want to animate yourself like you've seen all the other popular TikTok-ers do, you'll need to record the video (or take the picture) on the Snapchat App first and then upload it to TikTok.

### 03A step-by-step breakdown of this process has been provided below (pictures included)

##### Step 1Download the Snapchat App

Alright, to start off with, you'll need to download the Snapchat app on your smartphone (it's available for both Android and iOS devices)

##### Step 3Search for the Anime Style Filter on Snapchat

Once you have the Snapchat app open, click on the search bar at the top of the interface, type ‘anime style', and search

You might find that there are multiple versions of the filter (like as is shown in the image below), but the one that you need to select is the one titled Anime Style and created by Snapchat (it should appear first, as it does in the example)

![Look for the Anime Style filter on Snapchat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-03.jpg)

##### Step 4Turn Yourself into an Animated Character

Finally You should be moved to the video recorder or the profile picture taker, where you can see yourself animated once and for all

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

### 0112 Anime Filters to Turn Yourself into an Anime Character

**Anime Filter #1: Anime Style Realistic**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-06.jpg)

In order to fix some of the more glaring issues with the regular Anime Style filter, Snapchat created a second filter, called **Anime Style Realistic** This one has a distinctively less anime style when it comes to looks. But it does allow for more skin colors, better hair integration, and accessories

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens that you can use at any time.

Works with most skin tones.

Better hair/accessory integration.

##### Cons

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

**Anime Filter #2: Cartoon Style**

![Upload anime filter video on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-07.jpg)

Next, we have another Snapchat original lens called **Cartoon Style** This filter is more reminiscent of the older animated cartoon styles (think Pocahontas, Lilo & Stitch, etc.), but it doesn't make it any less fun

##### Pros

FREE Snapchat lens.

Works with all skin tones.

Works with accessories.

##### Cons

More of a cartoon animated style than anime.

Not available anywhere else, you can only use it with Snapchat.

Not great at capturing motion.

**Anime Filter #3: Anime Filter**

![Anime Filter from TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/how-you-can-turn-yourself-into-anime-character-using-anime-filter-08.jpg)

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

## Part 2 More Tutorials on Anime Filter That You Should Not Miss

The **Anime Style** filter that we introduced in the previous section isn't the only ‘animated' filter available, of course It's the one that caught the attention of a lot of people, thanks, in large part, to the participation of a couple of some of the bigger TikTok-ers on the platform. However, you can always expand your selection a bit by checking out some of the other interesting **anime filters** in the market:

The style is more realistic than anime.

It is not available anywhere else; you'll need to be on Snapchat to use it.

Not great at capturing motion.

This is a fun filter to use for those looking to spice up their timeline with something a little different (OR for those having a bad day and would like the almost-anonymity the filter can provide).

Now, although we mentioned that TikTok doesn't have any anime-style filters, the Chinese version of it (surprisingly) does You can see it being used in the image above, rendering the user into an animated (albeit not classically Japanese animated) character.

##### Pros

Free Chinese TikTok filter.

Great at capturing motion.

Chinese animated drawing style.

##### Cons

Only available for the foreign version of the TikTok app.

Not the best with skin tones.

It doesn't use the classic Japanese-animation style.

This has seen a popularity boost recently, with many TikTok users using it to show a ‘before' and ‘after' (like the image shown above), of their dance being animated.

### 03Anime Filter Has a Sadly Unsurprising Problem

You might have noticed this while we were introducing all the different types of anime-style filters available, but the popular **Anime Filter** has its shortcomings. Which includes:

**PROBLEM 1: Dark Skin Tones**

The anime filter's inability to capture darker skin tones accurately is one of the biggest issues users have with the filter.

**PROBLEM 2: Hair Style**

Hairstyle options are also very limited. And, as for black hairstyles? Well, the options are pretty much non-existent.

**PROBLEM 3: Face Accessories**

Do you wear glasses? How about piercings? Well, this won't translate for you either, unfortunately

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** The Anime Filter is a hot, trending topic in platforms like Tiktok, Instagram, and Snapchat It's also a fun way of engaging with the anime community

**●** There are other, similar face-animation filters available (The Cartoon 3D Styles, especially, were quite popular for a time)

**●** Unsurprisingly, the anime filter does have its problems… And it left a big chunk of the TikTok community pretty flabbergasted — and disappointed. But that didn't stop them from joining in the fun to provide some empowering commentary

### Frequently Asked Questions About Converting Video to GIFs

#### 1\. How To Crop A GIF To A Circle?

Whether or not you can crop a GIF into a circle, depends on the cropping tools the app you are using offers. Some GIF makers allow you to choose the shape to which you are going to crop a GIF, while others don’t provide this option.

Using [Filmora’s mask features](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably one of the easiest ways to crop a GIF to a circle, as you simply have to apply the mask to the footage and specify which parts of the GIF’s frames are going to be removed. What’s more, you can choose the shape of the mask in Filmora which enables you to crop GIFs into a variety of different shapes.

#### 2\. How To Turn A Video Into A GIF?

All you need to do in order to turn a video into a GIF is to change the file’s format. Most videos are saved as MP4, AVI, or MOV files, and nearly all video editors and GIF makers allow you to convert a video file into a GIF.

So, you simply have to choose GIF as the format in which you want to export a video file you imported into a video editing software or an online GIF maker and wait for the rendering process to be completed.

Drawings will always have a special place in storytelling. Whether you are demonstrating a new concept to a child, highlighting the features of a product to your bosses, or showcasing the intricacies of a marketing campaign, drawings make it easier for the audience to understand what is being said.

That is why it is so important to learn how to **create whiteboard animation**. When you learn how to create a whiteboard video with **[animate pictures app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, you are in a unique position when it comes to selling your story, and convincing others of what you already know.

* [**Part2: How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation**](#part3)

## Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?

To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.

Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using [2D animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.

When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.

To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.

## Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?

#### Step 1: Write a Script

Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.

It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/write-a-script.JPG)

#### Step 2: Start with the Storyboard

Now you have a script. You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.

When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboard.JPG)

#### Step 3: Create Images

If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.

![create image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-image.JPG)

#### Step 4: Animate Those Images

Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.

![animate drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-drawing.JPG)

#### Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio

The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.

![audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-audio.JPG)

## Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation

#### Evoke Empathy

The goal of a whiteboard animation video is not just to explain information in a cold and impersonal way. You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.

By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.

#### Personalize the Images

Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.

## Conclusion

Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project. And if you are wondering how you will edit your video, we recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use it to make animation video by adding keyframes, so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation. Besides, color correction and audio mixer will raise up your explainer video to a new level. Download it to have a try (Free)!
