## Part 1 How to Create Custom Animated WhatsApp Stickers on Android and iPhone

Animated third-party stickers cannot be added directly to WhatsApp and thus you can create a customized one. To create these GIF stickers for WhatsApp, you would need the help of third-party apps.

For Android devices, one such popular app is the Sticker Maker app. For iPhone, we suggest using Sticker Maker Studio app.

Once these apps are installed on your device, GIF stickers can be made in no time.

**Steps to make sticker GIF WhatsApp on Android phone**

Step 1\. Download, install and open the Sticker maker app on your Android device.

Step 2\. Tap on the "Create a new sticker pack" option on your app.

Step 3\. Give the desired name to your sticker pack and click on the Create button.

Step 4\. To add the animated stickers, click on the created sticker pack.

Step 5\. Next, click on the first box, and then from the menu choose the Select file option.

![Create Personalised GIF Sticker Android1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/stunning-ideas-about-creating-personalised-whatsapp-gif-sticker-02.jpg)

Step 6\. Next, choose the video from your phone from which you wish to create a sticker. You can even add a GIF file. After the media file is added, the app will compress it and will turn it into an animated sticker automatically.

Step 7\. Now, you need to add 3 animated stickers to the other boxes of the sticker app (as mentioned in step 5).

Note: Multiple stickers can be added using the same process.

Step 8\. Click on the "Add to WhatsApp" button after a minimum of 3 stickers are added to the pack.

## Part 1 5 Editing Motion Graphics Techniques in Adobe Premiere Pro

A variety of editing techniques of **motion graphics for Premiere Pro** are ready to give a classy touch to your videos. Let’s brush up through the best you can have.

### 01Cropping Clips

Cropping your videos allows you to fit them into your required size frames. To remove any unwanted portions of your edits, crop them in adobe Premiere Pro with your desired aspect ratio to give that ‘just perfect’ look to your edits.

Start from importing and adding your footage to your project panel, followed by creating a fresh composition. Now, choose ‘Crop’ from the Effects panel to add it to your clip, either by double-clicking or dragging and dropping.

### 02Trimming Clips

If you want to adjust the ‘In and Out’ play back sequence of your edited clips, you can go for trimming them. You can trim your clips in the Source and Program monitors, or even in the Premiere Pro timeline. You can choose from the standard cut, jump cut, B-roll cut etc, to suit your editing needs and styles.

All you need to do is open the clip, mark the In and Out points, adjust their sequence with previous or next edits in your cue and that’s it. You can also use keyboard shortcuts for this purpose. However, you need to preset these shortcuts before you begin editing your clips.

### 03Adding Text

You can try adding simple and formatted texts to enhance your video outlook. This comes handy when you are aiming to deliver specific messages to your audience. You can add normal write-ups, callout quotations and customize your text in a number of exciting styles. Just go to the Type tool, format your text in the Text Box and you’re done!

### 04Audio Level Adjustment

Want to add spark to your clips with a synchronized audio visual effect? After you finish trimming and cropping, consider opting for an in-line audio adjustment. This will definitely enhance your video and take your craft to the next level.

All you need to do is select an audio clip, click on ‘Audio Gain’ in the drop down menu, set desired Decibel count in the Audio Gain Box and select ‘OK’.

### 05Exporting Videos

Once you are done with your video craft, you should certainly look forward to making it available for social exposure. To do this, select appropriate sequence constraints in the Export window, choose the export platform, format and Codec, make fine tuning and bit rate adjustments and finish export either in Premiere Pro or Media Encoder.

The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet's skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.

The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet's skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.

The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet's skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.

To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story's overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.
