02 [How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for Youtube](#Part 2)

03 [How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

![Natural Readers - Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers4.png)

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

![Cepstral Voices - Demo Voices Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers7.png)

## Part 4 **Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech**

Now, onto some more **anime text-to-speech** options that you can try in order to make your text-to-speech script sound exactly like your favorite cartoon or anime characters! For this list, we've not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:

### 01Flixier

Flixier is the first **anime text-to-speech** maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

**●** It comes with advanced team functionalities.

![Flixier Online Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers8.png)

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

![Woord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers9.png)

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

![Speechelo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers10.png)

### 04Cartoon Animator 4

Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you're really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.

**●** Free-to-use **text-to-speech anime character**

**●** Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.

**●** A wide variety of voice options to choose from.

![Cartoon Animator 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers11.png)

### 05TTS Reader

TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon/anime characters. It doesn't have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you're looking for is something easy to use.

**●** Available to use online for FREE.

**●** Variety of different voice options.

**●** Adjustable speed for voice.

![TTS Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers12.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** If you're looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it's important that you're aware of all the different options out there!

**●** Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you'll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.

**●** In the end, you'll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.

You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

**●** It comes with advanced team functionalities.

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

For those who want more than the usual robotic text-to-speech AI that you see in more professional software. Learn more about all this below, we've prepared an entire guide for you!

02 [How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for Youtube](#Part 2)

03 [How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

![Natural Readers - Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers4.png)

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most.

03 [The Best 8 Places for High-Quality Royalty Free Gifs (Paid and Free)](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 2 **Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?**
