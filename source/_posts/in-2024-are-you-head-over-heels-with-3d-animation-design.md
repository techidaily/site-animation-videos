## Part 1 What is AI Artist? Plus how to cartoon yourself with it

We all remember the Cartoon filter challenge on Facebook, right? Everyone was excited to transform themselves into a cartoon. The options of making personalized cartoon representations of yourself was pretty limited back then. With the Voila AI artist app you can choose at least 3 different cartoon variations of yourself.

![voila ai artist](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-make-3d-cartoon-of-yourself-01.jpg)

The Voila AI artist app can be downloaded from the Apple App store and Android Play Store. You can use the app for free but for faster editing and an ad free experience, you will need to upgrade to the paid version. Other than just creating a cartoon of yourself, you can also create renaissance portraits and caricatures.

**●** Step 1: Download the Voila AI artist App for your device, and complete the installation process. Allow the app to access your Phone's Camera rolling permission.

**●** Step 2: Select the style option you want to use. What we are using here is 3D cartoon (other options: 2D Cartoon, Caricature & and the rest). Touch the arrow and start.

**●** Step 3: Now, with your camera roll open, click a new one or choose from your gallery. You can also find a **celebrities** option where you can search for celebrities. This generates a four-grid choice. If you are using the free version, then be prepared to encounter one or two ads. After a few seconds, you can exit out and get back to your images.

**●** Step 4: You will receive a composite grid of four options; your original image, plus three cartoon representations (Royalty 3D, Baby 3D & Cartoon 3D). Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.

If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free & watermark free animated representations.

Your virtual avatar would be able to interact with the real world through a virtual platform by using VR headsets and other tech. Sensing your virtual presence would be almost the same as the real world for your peers and colleagues. You can attend a meeting without ever having to travel.

The process behind creating a **3D cartoon of yourself** for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.

Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.

Here, you can select the option you like the most and start editing. Locate the up arrow button to immediately share on your preferred social media or simply save a copy in your device.

If the AI artist app has any paid and premium version, upon subscribing you will get ad free & watermark free animated representations.

## Part 2 How to Create a 3D Cartoon of Yourself for Meta

Facebook only recently rebranded themselves as Meta. This has now started the rush to create a live virtual interaction space, and big companies like Microsoft and Nvidia are now competing with each other to bridge the gap.

Soon, activities like convening meetings, attending live events or even dating online would take place in virtual environments. So best be prepared for the future by creating a 3D avatar for yourself.

The process behind creating a **3D cartoon of yourself** for Meta platforms starts by establishing a facial rig which is like a framework for the cartoon animations to sit on. These days, most apps come with automatic FACS facial rigging which is why certain Instagram filters like the Puppy nose filter was possible.

Presently, creating a complete 3D virtual model of yourself is a bit complicated to do on your own but soon this service will be automated in an app for you.

## Part 3 How to make 3D Cartoon From a Photo

Note; These steps are to be perceived as a simplified overview of your objectives when editing on Photoshop;

**●** To start out on turning your image into a 3D character, you need to learn how to create layers and then stack them on each other.

**●** You can then ‘liquify' these layers to form a mould for your image.

**●** Apply skin softening techniques to take away the realistic features of the photo before working on turning it into a cartoon.

**●** Now you can start focus on applying the details to features like eyes, hair, nose and facial lines on your cartoon image.

**●** You can also change the colour of any individual features on your image. This method is applicable in making caricatures of your photo as well.

* [Part 2\. Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora](1.2)

### Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials

Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for **animated travel map** preparation:

**Step 1:** Get the Map

The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:

* Launch your preferred web browser
* Type **google.com** in the address bar or the search box and hit **Enter**
* Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen

![Get Travel Maps from Google Map](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg)

* Type **Snipping Tool** in the **Cortana** search box present on the left side of the **Taskbar**
* Launch **Snipping Tool**, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map

**Note:** **Snipping Tool** is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.

* Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC

**Step 2:** Mark Out the Map Path

The next step in the process of preparing an **animated travel map** is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, **Microsoft Paint** is used here, and the method is given below:

* Right-click the screenshot you just captured
* Go to **Open with** on the context menu, and then click **Paint** from the submenu that appears
* Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as **Red**
* Use the **Sphere** shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map
* Use the **Line** tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic
* Go to **File** \> **Save As**, and save the marked image with a different name

**Note:** Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it

**Step 3:** Download Some Travel Icons

Another important ingredient in an effective **travel map animation** is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car/bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer [royalty-free stock photos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at absolutely no cost are listed below:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
* [Wondershare Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers/creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms & Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.

### Part 2: Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora

After you have gathered all the necessary ingredients that are required to create a **travel map animation**, it is now time to get to work. The following instructions would guide you through the step-by-step process of preparing a decent and realistic **animated travel map** in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

**Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline**

Launch the [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your computer, click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.

![create animated travel map in Filmora - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg)

**Note:** Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.

**Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance**

Go to **Transition** from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the **Erase Slide** transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.

![add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-animated-travel-map.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview and Export**

Press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** window, select **MP4** from the formats list in the left, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.

**Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media**

Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.

![customize animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-animated-travel-map.jpg)

Next, position the **Skimmer** (**Playhead**) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the **Skimmer** a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing **Delete** on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.

![trim animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-cut-animated-travel-map.jpg)

Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to **Speed and Duration** from the context menu. On the **Custom Speed** box, drag the **Speed** slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the **Speed** box to get precise tenure. Click **OK** when you are done.

![adjust the speed of animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-travel-map-speed-duration.jpg)

**Step** **5:** **Add** **Animations to Travel Map**

Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to **Add Animation** from the context menu. Make sure that the **Skimmer** is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:

* Click **Add** to add the first keyframe

![add animations to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-animation-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Move a couple of frames further, and click **Add** one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the **Scale** slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.

![add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.
* After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.
* Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project**

Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to **Transition**, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably **Dissolve**, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.

Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to **Titles** on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click **OK** when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.

Once everything is complete, click the **Play** button in the **Preview** window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the **animated travel map** in your preferred format.

## Method 2 How to Make Interactive Animated Travel Map with Pictramap

If you don’t want to install a dedicated animation software on your computer due to limited hardware resources or some other reason, there is an online solution called Pictramap to create a **travel map animation** using a web browser. The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.

The process to create an **animated travel map** with Pictramap is given below:

**Step 1: Create a Project**

Launch your favorite web browser, go to <https://www.pictramap.com/>, click **Create yours now, it’s free**, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the **Dashboard**, enter a name in the field available under the **My Projects** section, and click **Create** to create a new project (the animated map).

![create travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pictramap-interface.jpg)

**Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute**

On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click **Add**. Click the location marker, click the **Travel Mode** icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.

![edit travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pictramap-travel-mode-edit.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview the Animation**

Click the **View Animation** button from the upper-right corner of the page to see the **animated travel map**.

![preview created travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-animated-travel-map-pictramap.jpg)

### Downsides of Using Pictramap to Create Animated Travel Map Video

Although Pictramap allows you to create a **travel map animation** with ease and extremely quickly, at the time of this writing, it offers no way of downloading the animation to your PC, and therefore it couldn’t be used in your projects.

If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.

## Method 3 How To Make Animated Travel Map Using Multidev

Multi.dev is still a new web-based application to build awesome animated maps, but it’s good! The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.

So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.

**Step 1: Open Multi.dev**

Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.

![multidev 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png)

Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.

**Step 2: Choose Your First Location**

Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.

Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!

![multidev 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-2.png)

**Step 3: Select Map Themes**

All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.

![multidev 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-3.png)

**Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer**

If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.

![multidev 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png)

![multidev 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png)

Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.

## Conclusion

An **animated travel map** plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.

Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.

### Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials

Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for **animated travel map** preparation:

**Step 1:** Get the Map

The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:

* Launch your preferred web browser
* Type **google.com** in the address bar or the search box and hit **Enter**
* Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen

![Get Travel Maps from Google Map](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg)

* Type **Snipping Tool** in the **Cortana** search box present on the left side of the **Taskbar**
* Launch **Snipping Tool**, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map

**Note:** **Snipping Tool** is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.

* Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC

**Step 2:** Mark Out the Map Path

The next step in the process of preparing an **animated travel map** is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, **Microsoft Paint** is used here, and the method is given below:

* Right-click the screenshot you just captured
* Go to **Open with** on the context menu, and then click **Paint** from the submenu that appears
* Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as **Red**
* Use the **Sphere** shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map
* Use the **Line** tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic
* Go to **File** \> **Save As**, and save the marked image with a different name

**Note:** Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it

**Step 3:** Download Some Travel Icons

Another important ingredient in an effective **travel map animation** is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car/bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer [royalty-free stock photos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at absolutely no cost are listed below:

* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
* [Wondershare Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers/creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms & Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.

### Part 2: Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora

After you have gathered all the necessary ingredients that are required to create a **travel map animation**, it is now time to get to work. The following instructions would guide you through the step-by-step process of preparing a decent and realistic **animated travel map** in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

**Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline**

Launch the [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your computer, click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.

![create animated travel map in Filmora - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg)

**Note:** Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.

**Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance**

Go to **Transition** from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the **Erase Slide** transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.

![add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-animated-travel-map.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview and Export**

Press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** window, select **MP4** from the formats list in the left, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.

**Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media**

Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.

![customize animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-animated-travel-map.jpg)

Next, position the **Skimmer** (**Playhead**) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the **Skimmer** a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing **Delete** on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.

![trim animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-cut-animated-travel-map.jpg)

Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to **Speed and Duration** from the context menu. On the **Custom Speed** box, drag the **Speed** slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the **Speed** box to get precise tenure. Click **OK** when you are done.

![adjust the speed of animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-travel-map-speed-duration.jpg)

**Step** **5:** **Add** **Animations to Travel Map**

Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to **Add Animation** from the context menu. Make sure that the **Skimmer** is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:

* Click **Add** to add the first keyframe

![add animations to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-animation-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Move a couple of frames further, and click **Add** one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the **Scale** slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.

![add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.
* After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.
* Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project**

Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to **Transition**, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably **Dissolve**, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.

Get back to the first frame in the Timeline, go to **Titles** on the standard toolbar, and add a title preset somewhere near the source location. Resize the text, change the format as needed, and add your preferred caption to it such as the start time, name, etc. Reduce the duration of the track so the title appears for a few frames, preferably before the map animation starts. Click **OK** when done. Repeat this process for the destination point as well.

Once everything is complete, click the **Play** button in the **Preview** window to review your work. If the video looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center of the interface, and use the method explained earlier to export the **animated travel map** in your preferred format.

## Method 2 How to Make Interactive Animated Travel Map with Pictramap

If you don’t want to install a dedicated animation software on your computer due to limited hardware resources or some other reason, there is an online solution called Pictramap to create a **travel map animation** using a web browser. The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.

The process to create an **animated travel map** with Pictramap is given below:

**Step 1: Create a Project**

Launch your favorite web browser, go to <https://www.pictramap.com/>, click **Create yours now, it’s free**, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the **Dashboard**, enter a name in the field available under the **My Projects** section, and click **Create** to create a new project (the animated map).

![create travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pictramap-interface.jpg)

**Step 2: Define the Locations and Method of Commute**

On the map, right-click the location you want to start your journey from, enter the name of the location or any other significant title, and click **Add**. Click the location marker, click the **Travel Mode** icon, and select your preferred mode of traveling. Repeat this process to mark the destination location as well.

![edit travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pictramap-travel-mode-edit.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview the Animation**

Click the **View Animation** button from the upper-right corner of the page to see the **animated travel map**.

![preview created travel map video with pictramap ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-animated-travel-map-pictramap.jpg)

### Downsides of Using Pictramap to Create Animated Travel Map Video

Although Pictramap allows you to create a **travel map animation** with ease and extremely quickly, at the time of this writing, it offers no way of downloading the animation to your PC, and therefore it couldn’t be used in your projects.

If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.

## Method 3 How To Make Animated Travel Map Using Multidev

Multi.dev is still a new web-based application to build awesome animated maps, but it’s good! The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.

So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.

**Step 1: Open Multi.dev**

Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.

![multidev 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png)

Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.

**Step 2: Choose Your First Location**

Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.

Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!

![multidev 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-2.png)

**Step 3: Select Map Themes**

All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.

![multidev 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-3.png)

**Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer**

If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.

![multidev 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png)

![multidev 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png)

Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.

## Conclusion

An **animated travel map** plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.

Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.

Next, position the **Skimmer** (**Playhead**) a couple of frames before the one the route line appears and starts stretching from, and click the Split icon from the editing toolbar above the Timeline itself. Repeat this process for the other side of the media, i.e., position the **Skimmer** a couple of frames after the route line reaches the destination location, and click the Split icon again. Then remove the separated segments from both the sides by selecting them and pressing **Delete** on the keyboard, leaving only the portion where the animation is visible.

Optionally, right-click the media that is left behind in the Timeline, and go to **Speed and Duration** from the context menu. On the **Custom Speed** box, drag the **Speed** slider to the left to decrease the playback speed resulting in the increased duration of the media. Alternatively, you can manually enter a value in the **Speed** box to get precise tenure. Click **OK** when you are done.

![adjust the speed of animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-travel-map-speed-duration.jpg)

**Step** **5:** **Add** **Animations to Travel Map**

Right-click the media in the Timeline, and go to **Add Animation** from the context menu. Make sure that the **Skimmer** is on the first frame, and add several keyframes as explained below:

* Click **Add** to add the first keyframe

![add animations to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-animation-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Move a couple of frames further, and click **Add** one more time. Now, while you are on this second keyframe, use the **Scale** slider to zoom in to the map so the source location remains within focus.

![add animation scale to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-scale-animated-travel-map.jpg)

* Next, move the Playhead further and add another keyframe a couple of frames before the route line hits the edge of the window.
* After this, move the Playhead again and position it where the route line reaches its destination location. Add another keyframe here as well, and move the map in the Preview window so the focus is now on the destination.
* Move the Playhead a few frames further, add another keyframe, and use the Scale slider to zoom a bit more into the map to make the entire animation look realistic. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Step 6: Add Icons and Titles, and Export the Project**

Drag the image of the traveling medium to the Timeline, and place it on the frame the route line starts from. Make sure to place the image on the track above the map, and stretch it to the end so it remains visible throughout the animation. Next, use the method explained above to add keyframes to move the medium along with the route line from the source to the destination. Optionally, add the image of the location marker at the destination point, go to **Transition**, and add your preferred transition effect, preferably **Dissolve**, to the marker track in the Timeline so it looks as if it has appeared as the medium arrived the destination.

The web app offers a lucrative interface that could be easily understood and worked with to produce an animated map for free.

The process to create an **animated travel map** with Pictramap is given below:

**Step 1: Create a Project**

Launch your favorite web browser, go to <https://www.pictramap.com/>, click **Create yours now, it’s free**, and sign up to Pictramap using your preferred method. When you are on the **Dashboard**, enter a name in the field available under the **My Projects** section, and click **Create** to create a new project (the animated map).

### Downsides of Using Pictramap to Create Animated Travel Map Video

Although Pictramap allows you to create a **travel map animation** with ease and extremely quickly, at the time of this writing, it offers no way of downloading the animation to your PC, and therefore it couldn’t be used in your projects.

If you are using Wondershare Filmora, you can use its built-in screen recording feature to record the animation that Pictramap plays, and then save the captured footage as MP4 or any other format on your computer. This video can then be imported to your projects for further uses.

## Method 3 How To Make Animated Travel Map Using Multidev

Multi.dev is still a new web-based application to build awesome animated maps, but it’s good! The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.

So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.

**Step 1: Open Multi.dev**

Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.

![multidev 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png)

Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.

**Step 2: Choose Your First Location**

Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.

Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!

![multidev 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-2.png)

**Step 3: Select Map Themes**

All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.

![multidev 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-3.png)

**Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer**

If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.

![multidev 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-4.png)

![multidev 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png)

Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.

## Conclusion

An **animated travel map** plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.

Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.

### Part 1: Prepare the Travel Map Materials

Following are the ingredients and the methods to collect them for **animated travel map** preparation:

**Step 1:** Get the Map

The first thing that you would need to prepare an animated map is an image of a realistic map. Thanks to Google and Microsoft, these things are now pretty easy to arrange. The process is given below:

* Launch your preferred web browser
* Type **google.com** in the address bar or the search box and hit **Enter**
* Scroll to zoom out so you can see the entire world map on one screen

![Get Travel Maps from Google Map](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-map.jpg)

* Type **Snipping Tool** in the **Cortana** search box present on the left side of the **Taskbar**
* Launch **Snipping Tool**, and use it to capture the screenshot of the map

**Note:** **Snipping Tool** is a built-in app in Windows 10 and is available for free. If you are using any other operating system, or have a different program to capture the screenshots, feel free to use it according to your convenience.

* Save the screenshot you captured as a JPG file on your PC

**Step 2:** Mark Out the Map Path

The next step in the process of preparing an **animated travel map** is to mark your route on it. To do so, you can use any of your preferred photo editing tools. However, to keep this illustration simple, **Microsoft Paint** is used here, and the method is given below:

* Right-click the screenshot you just captured
* Go to **Open with** on the context menu, and then click **Paint** from the submenu that appears
* Pick your preferred color from the pallet of the Paint interface. It is advisable to use an eye-catchy shade such as **Red**
* Use the **Sphere** shape tool to draw a circle over the source and destination locations on the map
* Use the **Line** tool to draw a line from the source point to the destination. Try giving the line a few turns to make it look realistic
* Go to **File** \> **Save As**, and save the marked image with a different name

**Note:** Once this is done, you should have two image files of the map, i.e., one without the marks and one with it

**Step 3:** Download Some Travel Icons

Another important ingredient in an effective **travel map animation** is touring icons such as location marker image, a traveling medium symbol like a helicopter, airplane, car/bike (for short distances), etc. A couple of websites that offer [royalty-free stock photos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at absolutely no cost are listed below:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
* [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
* [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)
* [Wondershare Filmstock](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note:** Although the websites given above allow you to download and use their stock images and icons for free, you may need to give credits to the designers/creators of the symbols while using their objects. Therefore, you are suggested to check the Terms & Conditions and norms of usage of the elements before downloading and adding them to your projects.

### Part 2: Make Animated Travel Map Videos with Filmora

After you have gathered all the necessary ingredients that are required to create a **travel map animation**, it is now time to get to work. The following instructions would guide you through the step-by-step process of preparing a decent and realistic **animated travel map** in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

**Step 1: Import Ingredients to Filmora and Add Them to the Timeline**

Launch the [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your computer, click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left area, and import all the images and icons that you collected earlier to program. Next, drag both the images of the map, i.e., with and without the marks to the Timeline, and ensure that they are of the same duration and are placed on the same track.

![create animated travel map in Filmora - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-animated-travel-map-ingredients.jpg)

**Note:** Be sure to put the map without the marks first, and then the one with the marks. Also note that the images have the playback duration of 5 seconds in the Timeline by default, and this tenure can be reduced or increased by dragging the side handle of the media to the left or right respectively.

**Step 2: Add Transition for Illusion of Route Appearance**

Go to **Transition** from the standard toolbar at the top, locate the **Erase Slide** transition effect from the available presets, and place it in between the two image files that you earlier added to the Timeline. Next, click and drag either of the side handles of the transition to the end of the media clip. Notice how the other side of the effect is expanded in equal proportion.

![add transitions to animated travel map in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-transitions-to-animated-travel-map.jpg)

**Step 3: Preview and Export**

Press the **Spacebar** on the keyboard to preview the video and see if the route appears as if it is being drawn on the map. Once the animation looks acceptable, click **EXPORT** from the top-center, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** window, select **MP4** from the formats list in the left, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner to export the current animation to MP4.

**Step 4: Customize the Travel Map Media**

Either start a new project and import the video of the map you exported in the previous step to the app and then to the Timeline, or remove the existing media from the Timeline in the same project, and add the exported video to it for convenience.

## Method 3 How To Make Animated Travel Map Using Multidev

Multi.dev is still a new web-based application to build awesome animated maps, but it’s good! The application helps you create presentations about all your recent and previous trips. And the interface is also hassle-free.

So, follow this step-by-step guide to making animated maps with Multi.dev.

**Step 1: Open Multi.dev**

Visit Multi.dev from your internet browser.

![multidev 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-1.png)

Once the tool gets open, you will see a demo video. This example clip will have animated maps of different locations. So it is up to you whether to use the same example and edit the places you have been to or are planning to visit. Or, simply create a new animated map from scratch.

**Step 2: Choose Your First Location**

Take your mouse cursor on the left side of the application and type the first location in the search bar. As soon as you do it, you will see that the “travel arrow” will automatically begin from there. Likewise, type and select the next location through the search bar.

Once you type the location, you will see 8 travel modes, including airplane, bus, and train. You can select the same mode for all sites or a different mode for another place. Totally up to you!

![multidev 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-2.png)

**Step 3: Select Map Themes**

All your chosen places will be highlighted in the software’s minimalistic map.

![multidev 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-3.png)

**Step 4: Download Map on Your Computer**

If you’re happy with the animated map, click the “Create Video” button to save the animated map on your computer in a few minutes.

![multidev 5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/multidev-5.png)

Contrarily, you can also share the animation by choosing the “Share Animation” option.

## Conclusion

An **animated travel map** plays an important role to add a realistic touring effect to your motion picture projects. While you can use a web app like Pictramap to create such an animation online easily and for free, the limitations it comes along with might keep you from choosing this method.

Instead, you may want to get more inclined toward a dedicated post-production software like Wondershare Filmora that gives you full control over the process, and the freedom to choose your preferred format to export the animation to for independent usage.

## How to Make a GIF in Photoshop

# How to Make a GIF in Photoshop

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 We all love GIFs and their impressive style of delivering stories. They not only contain set of frames rather they wrap inside lots of emotions and thoughts of creators. You can easily find numbers of eye catching GIF collections over social media sites.

 If you love these animated images then probably you might have initiated a search over internet about how to create GIFs. And search engine must have shown you a path to unlimited [GIF creator tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). That's common. But here we are going to talk about one professional recommendation for GIF creation. Yeah, it is Photoshop and it can instantly generate appealing animated Gifs for you.

 Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:

## How to make a GIF in Photoshop

* [Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop](#part1)
* [Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop](#part2)

### Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop

#### Step 1: Launch your software

 Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.

#### Step 2: Get your video clip imported

 As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.

#### Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings

 You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.

 It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:

**Colors:** Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.

**Dither:** The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.

**Lossy:** If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.

**Size:** Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.

#### Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file

 When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose "Save for Web" option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.

### Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop

 It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop's animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:

#### 1\.  Step 1

 First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts. It will provide you an option for Load Files into Stack. Now hit browse button and choose your images from desktop folder that you further want to use for development of GIF image. Hit OK. It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.

 Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.

 All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File > New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.

 Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have "Load Files into Stack" feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.

#### 2\.  Step 2

 Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.

 As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose "Make Frames from Layer" option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.

#### 3\.  Step 3

 Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.

 If you love these animated images then probably you might have initiated a search over internet about how to create GIFs. And search engine must have shown you a path to unlimited [GIF creator tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). That's common. But here we are going to talk about one professional recommendation for GIF creation. Yeah, it is Photoshop and it can instantly generate appealing animated Gifs for you.

 Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:

## How to make a GIF in Photoshop

* [Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop](#part1)
* [Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop](#part2)

### Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop

#### Step 1: Launch your software

 Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.

#### Step 2: Get your video clip imported

 As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.

#### Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings

 You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.

 It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:

**Colors:** Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.

**Dither:** The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.

**Lossy:** If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.

**Size:** Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.

#### Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file

 When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose "Save for Web" option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.

### Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop

 It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop's animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:

#### 1\.  Step 1

 First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts. It will provide you an option for Load Files into Stack. Now hit browse button and choose your images from desktop folder that you further want to use for development of GIF image. Hit OK. It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.

 Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.

 All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File > New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.

 Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have "Load Files into Stack" feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.

#### 2\.  Step 2

 Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.

 As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose "Make Frames from Layer" option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.

#### 3\.  Step 3

 Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.

## Learn Pencil2D Animation Tutorial Overview

Animation is one of the trendiest technologies. The basics of animation were formulated in the 2000s from the moving page trick. The first few animators learned that animation is nothing but continuous switching of frames from one to another.

## Part 2 Overview of the Application Interface

### 1\. The brush tool

The brush tool must have reminded you of paint software in windows. The brush tool is a popular and highly utilitarian basic tool in Pencil2D animation software. You can either access it via the user interface or quickly access it by using the B key on your keyboard. As the name suggests, the brush tool is literally just a brush that allows you to draw and paint any sort of drawings of different shades, colors, and thickness. If you wish to change the color, you can find a color palette on the left side of the interface.

![brush tool pencil2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-1.jpg)

### 2\. The eraser tool

You've a brush tool; it's almost common sense that there'd be an eraser. The eraser tool has an eraser as its icon. If you wish to use the eraser, click on the eraser tool or simply click the E button on your keyboard. Once you've selected the tool, you need to simply hover over the parts you wish to erase.

![eraser tool pencil2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-2.jpg)

### 3\. Bucket tool

The bucket tool is another useful tool that you can find in the left tool pane of pencil 2d animation. The tool icon looks like a bucket and it is used to fill an entire area with a particular color. You can choose the color you'd like to fill from the color pallet available on the left side. Alternatively, you can also access the bucket tool by pressing the "K" key on your keyboard.

![bucket tool pencil2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-3.jpg)

### 4\. Custom colors

A cool feature that you can find on pencil 2d animation software is the custom color one. You can merge and mix colors according to your choice and create your own color. To do so, you need to click on the small color box that you'll find at the top right of your screen. By doing so, a huge color wheel will appear on your screen. Now you can either enter values of the R, G, and B if you wish to merge different colors and make a new one or select a particular color from the huge color wheel that appears in front of you. These colors vary in gradient, shade, and a lot of different factors.

![custom colors pencil2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-4.jpg)

### 5\. The Undo button

The Undo button is a highly useful functionality for the lazy ones who do not wish to erase the mistake they made. By undoing, the previous step gets reverted and you can start over again. The traditional undo shortcut, Ctrl+Z does work in the pencil 2d animation. Alternatively, you can also use the undo feature via the user interface. You can do so by heading over to the edit option in the topmost bar. The first option in the drop-down menu would be undo.

![undo pencil2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-5.jpg)

## Part 3 How to Create Animations with Pencil2D?

Creating animations in pencil 2d is slightly sophisticated and certainly needs minimal practice. Follow the steps listed below in order to learn how to animate through pencil 2d to make your first animation.

### 1\. Ensure that you've turned on your bitmap on the first frame

Animation works through quick switching of frame which makes it appear as though the object is in motion. By turning on the bitmap, pencil 2d animation ensures that you've no blank frames at the start of your animation.

![create animation pencil2d 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-6.jpg)

### 2\. Draw your animated character

Since you're trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.

![create animation pencil2d 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-7.jpg)

### 3.The three circular buttons

Once you're satisfied with the character you draw, you need to spot the 3 circular buttons which are arranged in the "+","-","+" order. By pressing the first "+" button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the "-" button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next "+" button, it will duplicate the current slide.

![create animation pencil2d 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-8.jpg)

### 4.Repeat until you get an animation

Now that you know how to deal with multiple frames, you can continue creating frames and making the animated characters move by tweaking with the drawing in every frame. For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you've your desired animated video.

Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you've your desired animated video.
