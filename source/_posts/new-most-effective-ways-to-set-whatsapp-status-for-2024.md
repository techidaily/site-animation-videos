Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It's a good way of starting if you're not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won't demand any immediate monetary commitment.

Now, as for its features, today, we'll be focusing on **Blender Rigging** features.

#### In this article

01 [Why Use Blender Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]](#Part 2)

03 [Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Use Blender Rigging?**

**Blender Character Rigging** is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it's capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.

So, if you want to create video projects for your audience's entertainment or edification with animation, then **Blender Rigging** is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished **Blender Rigging** animations.)

![Blender Character Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes1.png)

## Part 2 **The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]**

For this next section, we're going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about **Blender Character Rigging**, **Blender Facial Rigging**, **Blender Muscle Rig**, and so on.

These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we've linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it's something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender' experience.)

### 01**Blender Character Rigging**

The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, **Blender Character Rigging**. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy **Blender character rigging**, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.

### 02**Blender Facial Rigging**

Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about **Blender Facial Rigging** from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of **Blender Rigging** tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face's character to become animated.)

### 03**Blender Muscle Rigging**

Creating a **Blender Muscle Rig** is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage' as you say, with your Animations. The video that we've attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of **Blender Rigging** in general and has extensively explained how to create a **Blender Human Rig** from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.

### 04**Blender Rigging**

Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional' methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It's an especially good skill to learn if you're more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)

### 05**Blender Rigging**

This next tutorial is an introduction to basic **Blender Rigging**. It's a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.

## Part 3 **Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course**

For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about **Blender Rigging**. Whether it be about **Blender character rigging**, **Blender facial rigging**, **free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs**, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.

### 01**Where to Learn the Course?**

The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters' **blender rigging** course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.

### 02**Other Tools to Learn Rigging**

As for other places to learn? We suggest the "Blender Fundamentals" course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is "Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of **Blender rigging** (including **Blender rigging** and **Blender rigging** videos.)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in trying out **blender rigging** yourself, you'll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.

**●** Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.

**●** For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common **Blender Rigging** subjects.

**●** If you're looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master's introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender's own "Blender Fundamental" series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you'll need to know.)

The advent of many instant chats had led to the demand for GIFs and animated PNGs. Users access these files to express their emotions amidst the chat environment. There are unique ways to convert GIFs to animated PNGs precisely. In the digital space, there are surplus applications are available to perform this conversion process without compromising with the quality factors.

![GIF-APNG ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/gif-apng.jpg)

In this article, a detailed discussion on the GIFs and the animated PNGs are available for better understanding. It is the process of working with images and implementing some actions with the pictures that makes it appear interesting. Most GIFs and animated PNGs are used for fun and it helps to excite your friends amidst serious chats. It serves as the source of conveying thoughts with fun-filled visuals. Before choosing between the GIFs and APNGs, analyze which file format offers you surplus advantages for optimal handling. Here, in the below discussion you will study the features of this file format and the precise methods to switch between these two files efficiently.

02 [GIF vs animated PNG, which is better?](#Part 2)

03 [Can PNG be animated like GIF?](#Part 3)

04 [How to Convert GIF to animated PNG?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is GIF & What is animated PNG

The GIFs are animated images and the picture moves in a sequence in a cycle. The movement repeats without stopping. This type of picture is popular on the webpages and the built-in templates are available in the digital space for quick downloads. The single-frame GIFs take more time to download and displays exciting moves that trigger laughter with audiences. GIF takes the abbreviation of Graphics Interchange Format. It came into existence in the year 1980s and is widely used globally. GIFs are animated images in a basic format. It adopts the safe LZW algorithm that tracks the colors optimally.

![GIF-and-APNG ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/gif-and-apng.jpg)

The superior form of the motion picture is animated PNGs. It stands for Portable Network Graphics. This format supports indexed color, grayscale, and true color images. Additionally, the animated PNGs has advantages like alpha channels, cross-platform gamma corrections and two-dimensional interlacing. APNG came into existence in the year 1995 and is compatible with a few web browsers.

## Part 2 GIF vs animated PNG, which is better?

When compared to GIFs and APNG, APNG seems to be technically strong with a wide range of supporting features. The quality of the file of APNG is good as it displays 24-bit images and 8- bit transparency. The APNG images can be compressed to the smallest value thereby encouraging the ease of transfer between devices. APNG has access to many color combinations whereas GIFs can use up to 256 colors. The new web browser versions are compatible with APNGs and the older browsers play the GIFs precisely. To view the APNG files in the older browsers you require external plugins or extensions. The higher quality APNGs are mostly used by professionals when compared to GIFs. The portability in moving the animated images is simple with APNGs. The GIF files have a poor compression rate and it is difficult to transfer at the digital space.

## Part 3 Can PNG be animated like GIF?

You can animate the PNG files like GIF using reliable tools in the online space. There are unique programs to establish this process. It works on every detail on the PNG files and adds transition effects to the images to implement the movements. If you take closer looks at the digital space, you will acquire sophisticated programs to add transitions to the static pictures. While animating the PNG files, you must include frames, durations, and transition effects to the PNG images to include the animations. Based on the settings, the animated PNG file functions.
