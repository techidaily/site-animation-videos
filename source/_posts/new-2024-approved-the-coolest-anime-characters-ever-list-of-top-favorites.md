Anime is an elaborate form of animation with its bright colors and vivid imagination. It is a modified version of animation as we know it in the West with a peculiar Japanese taste of art. Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.

Now, who is the **coolest anime character** in the history of anime, and what are **[10 popular cartoon characters that you won't want to miss](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the **best anime characters** in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.

## Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever

* [1\. Light Yagami (Death Note)](#part1)
* [2\. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)](#part2)
* [3\. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)](#part3)
* [4\. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)](#part4)
* [5\. Levi (Attack on Titan)](#part5)
* [6\. Saitama (One Punch Man)](#part6)
* [7\. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)](#part7)
* [8\. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)](#part8)
* [9\. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)](#part9)
* [10\. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)](#part10)

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

## Final Words

Every anime character brings its feel and looks to the fictional world. As the vivid and ornate form of art, anime presents a different view of the world and the human mind's capabilities in creating such an intense augmentation of unreal to animated life.

Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.

Now, who is the **coolest anime character** in the history of anime, and what are **[10 popular cartoon characters that you won't want to miss](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the **best anime characters** in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.

## Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever

* [1\. Light Yagami (Death Note)](#part1)
* [2\. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)](#part2)
* [3\. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)](#part3)
* [4\. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)](#part4)
* [5\. Levi (Attack on Titan)](#part5)

* [8\. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)](#part8)
* [9\. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)](#part9)
* [10\. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)](#part10)

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter.

Complete with an introduction, some examples of great **stop motion animation movies** and a peek at what the process is usually like for the professionals working on said movies.

02 [Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder](#Part 2)

03 [Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films](#Part 3)

04 [How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?**

First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.

### 01**What is a Stop Motion Movie?**

The best way to introduce the concept of **stop motion animation movies** is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.

It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it's the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing 'motion' by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.

### 02**What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?**

There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever **stop motion movie** to be made? Which was "The Humpty Dumpty Circus" created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter's dolls.

You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Rudolph the Reindeer." And finally. You have "Chicken Run" which is considered the best performing **stop motion movie** of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.

## Part 2 **Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder**

Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the **stop motion movies** of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?

### 01**Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with **Lego Movie stop motion** animation. This **stop motion movie** animation style, also called 'Brickfilms', is the practice of using Lego to create **stop motion animation movies**. It's been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.

It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.

### 02**3D Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Alright, so how about 3D **stop motion movies**? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it's actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).

In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called "Tune with Tomorrow" but you might be more familiar with the title "Coraline."

## Part 3 **Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films**

Now for our list of the best **stop motion animation movies** of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the **stop motion movies** on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.

### 01**Coraline (2009)**

We mentioned this **stop motion movie** previously, but in case you haven't already watched it, it's a classic. The storytelling elements of "Coraline" really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn't all that it was chalked up to be.

### 02**The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)**

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is another **stop motion animation movie** that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington's obsession with ruining Christmas.

### 03**Chicken Run (1994)**

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.

### 04**Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)**

The next film, released in the same year as "Coraline", is called "Fantastic Mr. Fox." This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, 'Mr. Fox' and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.

### 05**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)**

Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.

### 06**Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)**

From the makers of Coraline is the **stop motion animation movie**, called "Kubo and The Two Strings" (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It's quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.

### 07**Alice (1988)**

This next stop motion film is quite unique. It's called "Alice" and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.

### 08**8\. Mary and Max (2009)**

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised 'tutorial'. It won't be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how **stop motion movies** are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

![Set Up Your Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss1.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

And then introducing 'motion' by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.

### 02**What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?**

There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever **stop motion movie** to be made? Which was "The Humpty Dumpty Circus" created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter's dolls.

You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Rudolph the Reindeer." And finally. You have "Chicken Run" which is considered the best performing **stop motion movie** of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.

## Part 2 **Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder**

Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the **stop motion movies** of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?

### 01**Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with **Lego Movie stop motion** animation. This **stop motion movie** animation style, also called 'Brickfilms', is the practice of using Lego to create **stop motion animation movies**. It's been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.

It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.

### 02**3D Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Alright, so how about 3D **stop motion movies**? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it's actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).

In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called "Tune with Tomorrow" but you might be more familiar with the title "Coraline."

## Part 3 **Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films**

Now for our list of the best **stop motion animation movies** of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the **stop motion movies** on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.

### 01**Coraline (2009)**

We mentioned this **stop motion movie** previously, but in case you haven't already watched it, it's a classic. The storytelling elements of "Coraline" really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn't all that it was chalked up to be.

### 02**The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)**

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is another **stop motion animation movie** that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington's obsession with ruining Christmas.

### 03**Chicken Run (1994)**

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.

### 04**Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)**

The next film, released in the same year as "Coraline", is called "Fantastic Mr. Fox." This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, 'Mr. Fox' and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.

### 05**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)**

Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.

### 06**Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)**

From the makers of Coraline is the **stop motion animation movie**, called "Kubo and The Two Strings" (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It's quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.

### 07**Alice (1988)**

This next stop motion film is quite unique. It's called "Alice" and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.

### 08**8\. Mary and Max (2009)**

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised 'tutorial'. It won't be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how **stop motion movies** are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.

### 01**What is a Stop Motion Movie?**

The best way to introduce the concept of **stop motion animation movies** is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.

It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it's the process of taking a still image of a scene.

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

![Set Up Your Camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss1.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

#### In this article

02 [Top 3 Resources to Get Free Animated GIF Icons](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

![photoshop export gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-9.jpg)

### Method 2: Make Stunning Animated GIF Icons with Wondershare Filmora

Since Adobe Photoshop can be quite complicated to use, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora to create all kinds of animated GIF icons. It is a user-friendly media editing application that has a wide range of readily available assets and would also let you import files from your system.

Besides that, there are tons of stickers, visual elements, captions, animations, transitions, and so on that would let you create and customize funny GIF icons. Therefore, if you want to create animated GIF icons using Filmora, then you can simply follow these steps:

##### Step 1 Load Media Files (Images and Videos) on Filmora

To get things started, you can just launch Wondershare Filmora on your system and go to its File > Import menu to load media files to it. You can also drag and drop your media files directly to the interface of Filmora.

![ filmora load media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 Create or Edit GIFs on Wondershare Filmora

After loading your images or video clips, you can drag and drop them to the timeline at the bottom. In case you can want to get rid of any video clip, you can just hover the mouse around and use its trimming tool to meet your requirements.

![filmora trim gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif)

Once you have edited your videos or images, you can just go to their properties from the sidebar. From here, you can scale, reposition, rotate, flip, and perform other edits on your media files.

![filmora rotate image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/rotate-image-filmorax.jpg)

##### Step 1 Select a Template of your Choice on Canvas

Whenever you want to create a loading icon GIF, you can just go to your Canva account and look for any existing template. Apart from its existing template, you can also load a blank canvas.

## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

![photoshop export gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-9.jpg)

### Method 2: Make Stunning Animated GIF Icons with Wondershare Filmora
