**First Appearance**: How To Train Your Dragon

**Voiced by**: N/A

A more modern, but no-less loveable **animated character** that we all know and love is Toothless from 'How to Train Your Dragon!' Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.

'Beauty and the Beast' is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved **Disney Animated Characters**, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (**Voiced by** Jerry Orbach!)

**●** Honorable Mention #2: Maleficent

**Movie(s)**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**First Appearance**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**Voiced by**: Eleanor Audley

Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty' also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent's LIVE action form merited a sequel.

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo

**Movie(s)**: Dumbo (1941)

**First Appearance**: Dumbo (1941)

**Voiced by**: N/A

## Part 1: Top 10 Banned Anime List

Here is a list of the 10 banned animes you should know about and why they are banned:

### 1\. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）

It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.

![shoujo-tsubaki](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-shoujo-tsubaki.jpg)

### 2\. Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)

Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series' first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show's first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.

![osomatsu-san](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-osomatsu-san.jpg)

### 3\. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)

Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it's too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.

![excel saga](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-excel-saga.jpg)

### 4\. Death Note (Banned in China)

Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.

![death-note](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-death-note.jpg)

### 5\. Attack on Titan (Banned in China)

Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!

![attack-on-titan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-attack-on-titan.jpg)

### 6\. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)

With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.

![high-school-dxd](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-high-school-dxd.jpg)

### 7\. Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)

Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni _Puny Poemy_ is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.

![puni-puny-poemy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-puni-puny-poemy.jpg)

### 8\. Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)

Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.

![hetalia-axis-powers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hetalia-axis-powers.jpg)

### 9\. Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)

Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps _THE_ most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?

![pokeman-banned-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-pokeman-banned-anime.jpg)

### 10\. Kite (Banned in Norway)

Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.

## Part 1: Top 10 Banned Anime List

Here is a list of the 10 banned animes you should know about and why they are banned:

### 1\. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）

It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.

![shoujo-tsubaki](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-shoujo-tsubaki.jpg)

### 2\. Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)

Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series' first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show's first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.

![osomatsu-san](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-osomatsu-san.jpg)

### 3\. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)

Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it's too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.

![excel saga](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-excel-saga.jpg)

### 4\. Death Note (Banned in China)

Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.

![death-note](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-death-note.jpg)

### 5\. Attack on Titan (Banned in China)

Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!

![attack-on-titan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-attack-on-titan.jpg)

### 6\. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)

With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.

![high-school-dxd](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-high-school-dxd.jpg)

### 7\. Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)

Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni _Puny Poemy_ is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.

![puni-puny-poemy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-puni-puny-poemy.jpg)

### 8\. Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)

Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.

![hetalia-axis-powers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hetalia-axis-powers.jpg)

### 9\. Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)

Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps _THE_ most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?

![pokeman-banned-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-pokeman-banned-anime.jpg)

### 10\. Kite (Banned in Norway)

Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.
