Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![create and save unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG)

### 03Step 3 Give positions to the animation

Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.

![click record button unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG)

Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

Now, you have to uncheck the **Loop** **Time** tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

Alternatively, you can click the **Animator** tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the **New** **Animation** button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.

![double-tap new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG)

These were all the steps to **stop** **animation Unity**.

## Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?

After done with **Unity stop animation**, it's time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you're used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.

So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.

Select the **Dopesheet** at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the 'Curves' view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

![click animator controller unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG)

Let's call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.

Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select **Create**\> **Animations** tab.

Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.

### 02Open the animator tab

Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored **New** **Animation** button.

![double click new animation tab unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG)

### 03Create an animation

With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we'd like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add **Property**\> **Transform**\> **Rotation** tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.

Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.

![delete keyframe unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG)

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.

Here, you're all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning **the stop-animation Unity** tutorial.

You can even **stop motion animation on Photoshop** with the above tutorial.

### 06**Bonus Tip:**

We want to introduce an excellent video editor software called **[Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. It is from the house of Wondershare, a well-known software company worldwide.

So, let's begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:

For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we've grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.

![import metronome object unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG)

### 01Add the animator

So, the first step begins with adding the **Animator** component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the **Add** **Component** tab on the Unity panel's left side, searching for **Animator**, and clicking the **Animator**.

You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select **Create**\> **Animator** **Controller** tab.

### 04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum

With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.

![change pendulum rotation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG)

### 05Slow down the animation

As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we're required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the **Curves**; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.

![click curves unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG)

Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You're looking for easy tutorials on **Unity stop animation**!

![unity animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-01.JPG)

And luckily, we've got you covered as we've briefly explained how to perform **Unity stop animation from looping** and the steps to make a smooth animation.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Used for?

Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down 'game builder .'Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent 'Asset Store' where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that's Unity and its uses in a broader scope!

Before we take you through the next section, it's important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for 'integrated development environment.' So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.

Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:

**●** Simulations

**●** Animation

**●** Architectural Visualization

**●** Previsualization for Film

**●** Interactive Experiences

Among these features only, we'll describe **Unity stop animation** from looping in detail.

## Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?

As we said, we'll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to **stop** **Animation in Unity**. Thus, there are simple steps that we'd like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.

So, those simple steps to **stop motion animation in After Effects** in the loop also go like below:

Step 1 Go to the **Project** tab and select **Animation**.

Step 2 Open the **Inspector** tab.

Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox **Loop Time**, and you're good to go!

We'll describe the same, i.e., **Unity stop animation** from looping through the step guide below.

In this guide, we'll explain right from applying the Animation so that you'd understand better. So, let's begin without any further ado!

### 01Step 1 Delete animation folder

We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the **Delete** tab as depicted below.

Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.

![delete animation folder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG)

### 02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject

Now, you may have different subjects. We're creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.

![create-animation-unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG)

Now, hit the **Create** tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you've already created for the same.

![give position to animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG)

Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the **Play** button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won't stop.

![infinite loop animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG)

You can follow two ways to **stop this Animation in Unity** from looping, and we'll describe both methods below.

### 04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1

Go to the animation folder where you've created the animation and click the **New** **Animation** icon as shown below.

![click new animation unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG)

![click new animation unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG)

### 05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2

## Part 3 How to Create 3D Animations from a Single Still Image?

### 01Simple steps to create 3d animations from a single still image

When it comes to animation, Adobe is recognized as one of the best tools. Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:

**●** Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.

**●** Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.

**●** Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.

**●** Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called "Repousse". By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space

**●** Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.

04 [Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

![Natural Readers - Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers4.png)

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

![Cepstral Voices - Demo Voices Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers7.png)

## Part 4 **Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech**

Now, onto some more **anime text-to-speech** options that you can try in order to make your text-to-speech script sound exactly like your favorite cartoon or anime characters! For this list, we've not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:

### 01Flixier

Flixier is the first **anime text-to-speech** maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

**●** It comes with advanced team functionalities.

![Flixier Online Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers8.png)

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

![Woord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers9.png)

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

![Speechelo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers10.png)

### 04Cartoon Animator 4

Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you're really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.

**●** Free-to-use **text-to-speech anime character**

**●** Adjustable volume, pitch, and speed voice parameters.

**●** A wide variety of voice options to choose from.

![Cartoon Animator 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers11.png)

### 05TTS Reader

TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon/anime characters. It doesn't have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you're looking for is something easy to use.

**●** Available to use online for FREE.

**●** Variety of different voice options.

**●** Adjustable speed for voice.

![TTS Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers12.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** If you're looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it's important that you're aware of all the different options out there!

**●** Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you'll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.

**●** In the end, you'll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

![Cepstral Voices - Demo Voices Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers7.png)

## Part 4 **Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech**

Now, onto some more **anime text-to-speech** options that you can try in order to make your text-to-speech script sound exactly like your favorite cartoon or anime characters! For this list, we've not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:

### 01Flixier

Flixier is the first **anime text-to-speech** maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

**●** It comes with advanced team functionalities.

![Flixier Online Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers8.png)

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

![Speechelo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers10.png)

### 04Cartoon Animator 4

Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you're really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.

### 05TTS Reader

TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon/anime characters. It doesn't have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you're looking for is something easy to use.

**●** Available to use online for FREE.

**●** Variety of different voice options.

**●** Adjustable speed for voice.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** If you're looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it's important that you're aware of all the different options out there!

**●** Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you'll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.

**●** In the end, you'll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.

Our topic for today's article is on that exact same subject. Or, rather, more specifically, **anime text-to-speech**.

For those who want more than the usual robotic text-to-speech AI that you see in more professional software. Learn more about all this below, we've prepared an entire guide for you!

01 [What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for Youtube](#Part 2)

03 [How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.
