01 [10 Animate Pictures Apps](#Part 1)

02 [The contrast of These 10 Animate Pictures Apps](#Part 2)

## Part 1 10 Animate Pictures Apps

### 01 MotionLeap

![motionleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/epic-formula-to-animate-photos-from-these-10-animate-pictures-app-01.jpg)

**MotionLeap**

**●** **Price**

Free, with premium version available.

**●** **OS**

Android and iOS

**●** **Key features**

You can freeze parts of an image.

Variety of filters can be applied.

Although MotionLeap is free to use there's a Pro and subscription version with a greater variety of features in it. The best part about this animated pictures app is that it does not put any watermark over the final image.

The app can animate still photos and convert them into short, loop videos. This is done by the programming of the directional cues into the image which is executed by dragging actions of the thumb across your mobile screen.

Although, on MotionLeap, without the pro version, the photo will be saved in video format.

### 02 GIPHY

![GIPHY](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/epic-formula-to-animate-photos-from-these-10-animate-pictures-app-02.jpg)

**GIPHY**

**●** **Price**

Free

**●** **OS**

Android and iOS

**●** **Key features**

Simple, easy to use UI

A variety of built-in animation tools

Sticker maker on iOS (for iPhone X and later models)

We might already be acquainted with GIPHY as the most popular search engine for GIFs. Although, what’s unknown is that GIPHY has a mobile app both for Android and iOS which can be used to create GIFs and animate photos.

The app's key advantage is its highly intuitive and very easy to use interface that makes it really easy to animate photos with the GIPHY app. Above all, it is completely free to use and along with animating pictures, you can also add captions to your animated photos or even capture short videos.

### 03 Movepic

Free, with premium version available.

**●** **OS**

Android and iOS

**●** **Key features**

Easy to use.

A range of built in overlays and filters.

Movepic is another excellent app for animating pictures. As an animated pictures app, it is quite similar to MotionLeap owing to the fact that it animates still photos.

A downside of the Movepic free version is that it puts a watermark on the image and you cannot remove it without upgrading to the premium version or VIP account. The app saves the final images as a movie file and not as a GIF.

### 04 ImgPlay

ImgPlay is another very popular and effective animated pictures app. The app makes use of a range of ready-to-use animated photos for the web.

ImgPlay also comes with a range of advanced and easy-to-understand controls. This app, in spite of all its perks, puts a watermark on the image—which, once again, cannot be removed unless you buy the premium version of the app.

Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.

The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.

The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The "From Beginning to End" is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select "Selected Range Only." On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.

Last but not least, check the "Make Frame Animation" checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames.
