### 01Cruella De Vil, From 101 Dalmatians

**Name of the cartoon character**: Cruella De Vil

Your next villain on the list alone includes the words like Devil, Cruel, Evil, but you don’t need to spell each one of them in order to prove how wicked and cruel this female character is. A person don’t need to be a pet lover to know about the obsession of scalping puppies for the fur in terms of sick & twisted, however for the evil cartoon character ‘Cruella De Vil’, it is not just the horrible hobby but also a whole way of life. Aside from having penchant for the puppy murders, she loves to sit in home alone. **Cartoon Cruella devil**is the central antagonist of the animated series one hundred and one Dalmatians. Her death’s head-face, schizoid black &white head of hairsas well as her cheekbones which looks similar to a holding position of double-pointed arrows inside her mouth are enough to kill you.

In one of the episode of spin-off TV series by Disney: Hercules featured Jafar’s ghost in Strangers on the Train-style of plot to switch the enemies, Aladdin for the Hercules. Hades cannot believe in his guest’s melodramatic-histrionics & then indulges in few more wisecracks at the Jafar’s expense.
