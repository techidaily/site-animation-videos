## Part 1  5 Best Places to Find Animated Christmas GIFs for Free

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

![pinterest christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-2.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

If you are looking for funny Christmas GIFs, then Giphy would be one of the best places to explore. It has some of the most extensive GIFs collections of all styles, including Christmas wishes GIFs.

### 3\. Tenor

Tenor is another clean and user-friendly website where you can find different types of funny Merry Christmas GIFs for free. You can look for stickers and GIFs by simply entering keywords of your choice on Tenor.

Once you load an animated Christmas GIF, you can save it offline or generate its shareable link. In this way, you can directly share the Merry Christmas wishes GIF to your loved ones on platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Messenger, and so on.

## Part 2 How to Create your Animated Christmas GIFs (with Music): A DIY Guide

Most of these readily available animated Christmas GIFs are quite generic and lack a customized appeal. Therefore, if you want to come up with some customized Christmas wishes GIFs, then consider using a dedicated editing tool like Wondershare Filmora.

Since it is a user-friendly video and media editing tool, you won’t encounter issues working on an animated Christmas GIF. You can explore and use the wide range of media assets of Filmora or import anything from your system. Besides that, tons of transitions, filters, captions, and other effects would let you come up with some customized Merry Christmas wishes GIFs via Filmora in the following way.

##### Step 1 Load the Media Files of your Choice on Filmora

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about OBS animated lower thirds and their best alternatives you can use in 2022 and beyond.

01 [What are Lower Thirds in Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio](#Part 2)

03 [8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Lower Thirds in Animation?

To put it in simple words, a lower third is simply a graphic overlay that appears on top of the actual footage. As the name implies, the contents of the lower third usually occur at the lower end of the screen, but streamers can also configure the OBS settings to change their position within the screen. Ideally, lower third animations are utilized to give a context of the overall video.

Let's say you are life streaming your GTA V gameplay on YouTube. So, to help first-time viewers get the overall context, you can add GTA-related elements in the lower third animation and maximize viewer acquisition. In addition to this, you can also use OBS animated lower-thirds to display exclusive offers and discounts throughout the live stream.

## Part 2 How To Set Up An Animated Lower Third In OBS Studio

So, now that you know the major benefits of using animated lower thirds in OBS studio, let's understand how to set them up to make your live streams more engaging. It's worth noting that OBS works around the concept of layers that you can manage individually to run your live streams. So, to add an **animated lower third in OBS** studio, all you have to do is add a dedicated layer and place it right above the video layer.

When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you'll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don't have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.

Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your **OBS animated lower-third** graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you'll end up losing potential viewers.

Here's a YouTube video that'll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.

## Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives

While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don't have a high-configuration system, you won't be able to run the tool at all.

So, what's your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up **OBS animated lower-third** graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.

### 01Wirecast

![wirecast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/obs-animated-lower-thirds-alternative-02.jpg)

Like OBS, Wirecast is a popular video streaming platform that many content creators use to live stream on their social media handles. It also offers a layer-based architecture, which means users can add multiple layers separately and manage them through an easy-to-navigate panel.

One of the key reasons Wirecast is an ideal choice to add **animated lower-third** graphics to your live streams is its built-in collections. The tool already has several ready-to-integrate lower-third animations that one could import into their project without any hassle.

**Pros:**

**●** Built-in lower-third graphic templates

**●** Easy-to-use Interface

**●** Switch between multiple camera angles with one click

**Cons:**

**●** Unlike OBS Studio, Wirecast isn't available for free

**Why Do We Recommend Wirecast?**

Wirecast is a fully functional video streaming platform where you can easily manage all your live streams. Wirecast offers far better functionality than OBS Studio despite having a relatively easy-to-use UI.

### 02vMix

However, it also has a dedicated live stream manager to manage your live streams, switch between multiple camera angles, and add overlay animations to keep the viewers engaged.

When it comes to setting up the lower-third, you'll first need to create the graphics you want to display on top of the live streams. You can use Photoshop to design a custom lower-third animation if you are a professional designer. But, if you have just stepped into the world of live streams and don't have any prior experience with Photoshop, you can also purchase one of the ready-to-use lower-third packages and import them directly to OBS.

Either way, it would be crucial to ensure that your **OBS animated lower-third** graphics do not interfere with the actual video. Why? Because this will make the video look more cluttered, and you'll end up losing potential viewers.

Here's a YouTube video that'll walk you through the step-by-step procedure of creating lower-third animations in OBS Studio.

## Part 3 8 AMAZING OBS Animated Lower Thirds Alternatives

While OBS is a great tool to add lower-third animations to your live streams, it has its fair share of drawbacks. For instance, OBS has a pretty complicated interface, which means if you are an absolute beginner, you may not easily set up your live streams. Not to mention, OBS is heavy software - so if you don't have a high-configuration system, you won't be able to run the tool at all.

So, what's your next best option? Fortunately, there are several OBS alternatives that you can use to set up **OBS animated lower-third** graphics and enhance the overall quality of your live streams. To make your job easier, we have cherry-picked 8 of the most reliable OBS alternatives that you can use to add lower-third animations to a Livestream video.

### 01Wirecast

Before you act surprised, let us clarify that Adobe Photoshop isn't an alternative to OBS Studio. However, you can use it to create customized overlays and lower-third graphics to add a personal touch to your live streams. Suppose you are already familiar with Photoshop and have been using it for a few years. In that case, it'll allow you to design personalized text overlays, graphics, animations, and logos for your live streams.

Again, Canva doesn't support live stream management at all. However, like Adobe Photoshop, you can use Canva to create stunning lower-third overlays for your Livestream sessions. The major benefit of using Canva is that it has thousands of pre-made templates that you can import to your design with one click. All these templates are fully customizable - so you'll be able to design custom lower-third overlays for your live streams.

Note that this **cartoon-style drawing's** main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.
