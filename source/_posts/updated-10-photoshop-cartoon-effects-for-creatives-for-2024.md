## Part 1 How to Convert Video to GIF in Photoshop - Easy Way

If you want to **convert video to GIF** in Photoshop, here is a discussion of the easy way to go about it.

**Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right**

When you start to convert **mp4 to GIF using Photoshop**, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.

The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.

Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.

**Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop**

Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.

![import video photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly**

After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.

![preview of the video photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The "From Beginning to End" is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select "Selected Range Only." On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.

Last but not least, check the "Make Frame Animation" checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.

**Step 4: Edit the GIF**

Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.

That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.

**Step 5: Save the GIF**

Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).

![save gif photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-4.jpg)

Childhood crushes and idolization of **animated characters** were very normal things! **Popular animated characters** were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!

Today, in order to reminisce a little, we'll be going through some of the more **famous animated characters**!

Although we initially promised only 15 **animated characters**, we've stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more **popular animated characters** to reminisce about! We've also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!

### 01Mickey Mouse

**Movie(s)**: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)

**First Appearance**: Steamboat Willie (1928)

**Voiced by**: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine

When it comes to admirable **animated characters**, Disney's Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune!

Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as **animated characters** go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development.

**Movie(s)**: Finding Nemo (2003), Finding Dory (2016)

Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.

**Related Movie Clips**:

**Movie(s)**: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)

**Movie(s)**: Wall-E (2008)

**Related Movie Clips**:

**Movie(s)**: 101 Dalmatians

**First Appearance**: 101 Dalmatians

**Voiced by**: Betty Lou Gerson

When it comes to classic villain **animated characters**, one cannot forget about the illustrious Cruella de Vil! This character was pure evil in a feminine form!

**Related Movie Clips**:

**Movie(s)**: Monsters Inc.

**Movie(s)**: How To Train Your Dragon, How to Train your Dragon 2

**First Appearance**: How To Train Your Dragon

**Voiced by**: N/A

A more modern, but no-less loveable **animated character** that we all know and love is Toothless from 'How to Train Your Dragon!' Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 13Chihiro

**Movie(s)**: Spirited Away (2001)

**First Appearance**: Spirited Away (2001)

**Voiced by**: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 14Lumiere

**Movie(s)**: Beauty and the Beast (1991), The Enchanted Christmas (1997)

**First Appearance**: Beauty and the Beast (1991)

**Voiced by**: Jerry Orbach

'Beauty and the Beast' is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved **Disney Animated Characters**, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (**Voiced by** Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the 'Be Our Guest' track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast's love story.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 15Sophie

**Movie(s)**: Howl's Moving Castle (2004)

**Movie(s)**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**First Appearance**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**Voiced by**: Eleanor Audley

Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty' also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent's LIVE action form merited a sequel.

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo

**Movie(s)**: Dumbo (1941)

**First Appearance**: Dumbo (1941)

**Voiced by**: N/A
