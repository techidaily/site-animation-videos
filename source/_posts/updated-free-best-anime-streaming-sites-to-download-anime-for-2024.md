Creating animations in pencil 2d is slightly sophisticated and certainly needs minimal practice. Follow the steps listed below in order to learn how to animate through pencil 2d to make your first animation.

### 1\. Ensure that you've turned on your bitmap on the first frame

![create animation pencil2d 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-6.jpg)

### 2\. Draw your animated character

Since you're trying to animate, you need to have an animated character or object. Hence, the first step to making your first animation is by drawing the object or character that you wish to animate. Try to make the character as realistic as possible. To start with, maybe you can try animating just a stick figure; this is because animating a complex character is rather difficult for beginners.

![create animation pencil2d 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-7.jpg)

### 3.The three circular buttons

Once you're satisfied with the character you draw, you need to spot the 3 circular buttons which are arranged in the "+","-","+" order. By pressing the first "+" button, you can add an empty slide. If you click on the "-" button, it will delete the most recent slide and if you click on the next "+" button, it will duplicate the current slide.

![create animation pencil2d 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-pencil2d-animation-tutorial-overview-8.jpg)

### 4.Repeat until you get an animation

Now that you know how to deal with multiple frames, you can continue creating frames and making the animated characters move by tweaking with the drawing in every frame. For instance, if you wish to show that the animated character is running, in one of the frames the left leg should be forward and in the next one, the right leg should be forward. Keep repeating this process of tweaking with frames until you've your desired animated video.
