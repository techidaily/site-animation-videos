### 02Use ScrollSequence

Now, if you are not a professional editor or don't want to overcomplicate things, you can use ScrollSequence to add image-on-scroll animation to your website. For readers who don't know, ScrollSequence is a built-in WordPress plugin that you can directly install in your WordPress manager.

All the templates offer complete customization, which means you can adjust the animation playback, import your own media files, and even customize the text.

ScrollSequence is only available as a WordPress plugin and you won't be able to use it with any other website builder

### 03Write Your Own JavaScript Code

Finally, you can also write your own JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll. However, this method will be a bit complicated as you would require technical expertise to write dedicated JavaScript scripts to animate image-on-scroll. If you choose this solution, you'll have to start with writing HTML and CSS codes. This will help you style your web page in the beginning. And, once the web design is up and ready, you can move towards writing the JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll in your web page.

## Part 2 How to Create a Scrolling Text Animation (Infinite Loop)

Like image-on-scroll, text-on-scroll is another popular way to add visually appealing animations to your web designs. Text-on-scroll animations work the same way as image-on-scroll animations - the only difference is that these types of animations focus on the text playback instead of images. Again, you can use different methods to **animate text on scroll** and make your website's content run in an infinite loop.

Some of these methods include:

### 01Use Filmora

Thanks to Filmora's advanced editing panel, you can also use it to animate text within the videos. This will be an ideal solution for users who want to add videos with dedicated text banners and titles on their websites. With Filmora, you'll be able to animate the text and make custom transitions in a hassle-free manner.

![choose title template filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-04.JPG)

**Step 3 -** Again, double-click the title layer and you'll see a dedicated text editor on your screen. Here enter the text that you want to display within the video. You can also select text size, orientation, and font to personalize its appearance.

**Step 4 -** Finally, switch to the "Animation" tab at the left sidebar. Choose any of these animation templates and the text within the video will be animated automatically.

![animate title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-05.JPG)

So, that's how you can use Filmora to animate text-on-scroll to improve the overall visual appearance of your website videos.

### 02Scroll-Text-Animations for Single Words

Another way to implement scroll-text animations is to modify the HTML & CSS code of your website. Again, this method will only be feasible if you have prior coding experience and know how to write well-optimized code.

![one line animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-06.JPG)

The easiest way to animate text scrolls is through single-line animations. In this situation, only one line gets displayed at any particular time, which automatically gets switched to the next one as soon as you scroll down the cursor. If you are planning to create simple text-based animations, this method will help you get the job done easily.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode
