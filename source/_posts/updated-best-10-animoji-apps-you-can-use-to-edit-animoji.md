**Adobe Animate Text Effects** can be created with the use of Adobe Animate. As well as a couple of other models of Adobe.

We've outline a thorough explanation on the subject so that you can be prepared as you can be, so continue reading in order to learn more.

03 [5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects](#Part 3)

04 [Adobe Alternative to Make Text Animation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's Text Animation?

![Text Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know1.png)

"**Text Animation**" refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!

## Part 2 **What Adobe Program is Best for Text Animation?**

![Adobe Animation Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know2.png)

Adobe Animate is Adobe's very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

![After Effects: Animators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png)

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

![Per Character 3D Text Properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know5.png)

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

![Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know6.png)

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.

![Text Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know1.png)

"**Text Animation**" refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!

## Part 2 **What Adobe Program is Best for Text Animation?**

![Adobe Animation Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know2.png)

Adobe Animate is Adobe's very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

![After Effects: Animators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png)

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

![Per Character 3D Text Properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know5.png)

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

![Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know6.png)

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.

03 [Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?**

First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.

### 01**What is a Stop Motion Movie?**

The best way to introduce the concept of **stop motion animation movies** is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.

It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it's the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing 'motion' by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.

### 02**What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?**

There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever **stop motion movie** to be made? Which was "The Humpty Dumpty Circus" created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter's dolls.

You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Rudolph the Reindeer." And finally. You have "Chicken Run" which is considered the best performing **stop motion movie** of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.

## Part 2 **Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder**

Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the **stop motion movies** of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?

### 01**Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with **Lego Movie stop motion** animation. This **stop motion movie** animation style, also called 'Brickfilms', is the practice of using Lego to create **stop motion animation movies**. It's been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.

It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.

### 02**3D Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Alright, so how about 3D **stop motion movies**? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it's actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).

In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called "Tune with Tomorrow" but you might be more familiar with the title "Coraline."

## Part 3 **Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films**

Now for our list of the best **stop motion animation movies** of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the **stop motion movies** on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.

### 01**Coraline (2009)**

We mentioned this **stop motion movie** previously, but in case you haven't already watched it, it's a classic. The storytelling elements of "Coraline" really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn't all that it was chalked up to be.

### 02**The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)**

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is another **stop motion animation movie** that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington's obsession with ruining Christmas.

### 03**Chicken Run (1994)**

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.

### 04**Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)**

The next film, released in the same year as "Coraline", is called "Fantastic Mr. Fox." This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, 'Mr. Fox' and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.

### 05**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)**

Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.

### 06**Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)**

From the makers of Coraline is the **stop motion animation movie**, called "Kubo and The Two Strings" (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It's quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.

### 07**Alice (1988)**

This next stop motion film is quite unique. It's called "Alice" and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.

### 08**8\. Mary and Max (2009)**

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised 'tutorial'. It won't be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how **stop motion movies** are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Stop motion animation is a classic way of telling a story of fantastical characters and settings without having to draw everything frame by frame.

**●** It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.

**●** If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best **stop motion movies** in film history, you'll notice that they're all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)

**●** This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised 'tutorial'. It won't be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how **stop motion movies** are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. It's all set up for professionals and beginners alike, allowing you the freedom to create characters that are both simple and complex with ease. In this case, of course, the goal is to put together your story through all the different frames that you captured in the process.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Stop motion animation is a classic way of telling a story of fantastical characters and settings without having to draw everything frame by frame.

**●** It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.

**●** If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best **stop motion movies** in film history, you'll notice that they're all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)

**●** This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.

We do have some recommendations for you. Even more than that, we've compiled a comprehensive guide on **stop motion movies** in hopes of introducing this often-forgotten art to those that may have never thought to appreciate it before.

Complete with an introduction, some examples of great **stop motion animation movies** and a peek at what the process is usually like for the professionals working on said movies.

02 [Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder](#Part 2)

03 [Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films](#Part 3)

04 [How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?**

First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.

### 01**What is a Stop Motion Movie?**

The best way to introduce the concept of **stop motion animation movies** is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.

It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it's the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing 'motion' by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.

### 02**What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?**

There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever **stop motion movie** to be made? Which was "The Humpty Dumpty Circus" created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter's dolls.

You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Rudolph the Reindeer." And finally. You have "Chicken Run" which is considered the best performing **stop motion movie** of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.

## Part 2 **Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder**

Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the **stop motion movies** of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?

### 01**Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with **Lego Movie stop motion** animation. This **stop motion movie** animation style, also called 'Brickfilms', is the practice of using Lego to create **stop motion animation movies**. It's been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.

It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.

### 02**3D Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Alright, so how about 3D **stop motion movies**? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it's actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).

In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called "Tune with Tomorrow" but you might be more familiar with the title "Coraline."

## Part 3 **Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films**

Now for our list of the best **stop motion animation movies** of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the **stop motion movies** on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.

### 01**Coraline (2009)**

We mentioned this **stop motion movie** previously, but in case you haven't already watched it, it's a classic. The storytelling elements of "Coraline" really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn't all that it was chalked up to be.

### 02**The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)**

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is another **stop motion animation movie** that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington's obsession with ruining Christmas.

### 03**Chicken Run (1994)**

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.

### 04**Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)**

The next film, released in the same year as "Coraline", is called "Fantastic Mr. Fox." This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, 'Mr. Fox' and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.

### 05**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)**

Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.

### 06**Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)**

From the makers of Coraline is the **stop motion animation movie**, called "Kubo and The Two Strings" (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It's quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.

### 07**Alice (1988)**

This next stop motion film is quite unique. It's called "Alice" and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.

### 08**8\. Mary and Max (2009)**

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of **animate rigging**

To help them out (as well as other **animation rigging** beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!

#### In this article

01 [The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Animate Rigging?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation**

Before anything else, we’ve prepared a bit of an OVERVIEW on rigging in animation. This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.

### 01**What is Rigging in Animation**

Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.

Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) in order to get this done!

![AutoDesk Maya Software Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging1.jpg)

### 02**An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging**

2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!

### 03**An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging**

3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.

In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.

### 04**Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving**

Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:

**Joints|Bones**: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.

**Driven Keys**: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).

**Blend Shapes**: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.

**Inverse Kinematics**: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.

**Forward Kinematics**: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.

**Control Curves**: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.

**Constraint**: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.

**Deformers**: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.

**Skinning**: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.

**Weight Planning**: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.

**Facial Rigging**: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.

## Part 2 **How Do You Animate Rigging?**

Now, onto actually talking about how you can start **animate rigging**. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.

### 01**How to Rig a Simple Character**

This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:

**Step 1: Design Your Character**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg)

Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of **animation rigging** you’ll need to work on for that character.

For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!

So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.

**Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg)

When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!

Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.

**Step 3: Connect The Layers!**

It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.

**Step 4: Timing Your Animation**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging4.jpg)

With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions

### 02**Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging**

This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:

Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!

Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.

If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.

![AutoDesk Maya Software Shape Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging5.jpg)

### 03**How Auto Rig Mapping Works**

Auto-rigging is the use of pre-made rigs in order to simplify the process. The tool automatically maps the areas where the characters and the rig are given the same symbol names and snaps them together to create joints for a motion to be applied.

### 04**How Visual Rig Mapping Works**

Visual mapping is a lot more complicated the auto-rig mapping, so it’s not something you want to jump into immediately. However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:

Manually make connections starting with the joints.

Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.

Motion can then be added to the timeline.

### 05**Finalizing Your Animated Rig**

To finish us off, let’s talk about how you go about publishing your finished product! Of course, even after you have your complex rig completed, there are still other matters to think about in terms of making sure that the video is of quality!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Start off on the right footing by learning the basics of animation! These days, there are more options than ever, with the modern 3D animation rigging style now just as popular as the more classic 2D animation style.

**●** The best way to learn animation rigging is to practice! Structured guides can help you get to the point of almost mastery, but it’s not until you start playing with the tools of your craft that you can truly learn how to create beautiful animations!

**●** Some of the more complex functions of rigging require a lot of patience, so make sure that you always go into your projects with a level-head. And, just to be sure, invest in tools that will help rather than hinder your progress! There are many advanced software out there that can help you improve more easily.

Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of **animation rigging** you’ll need to work on for that character.

For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!

So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.

**Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg)

When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!

Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.

**Step 3: Connect The Layers!**

It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.

**Step 4: Timing Your Animation**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging4.jpg)

With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions

### 02**Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging**

This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:

Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!

Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.

If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.

![AutoDesk Maya Software Shape Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging5.jpg)

### 03**How Auto Rig Mapping Works**

Auto-rigging is the use of pre-made rigs in order to simplify the process. The tool automatically maps the areas where the characters and the rig are given the same symbol names and snaps them together to create joints for a motion to be applied.

### 04**How Visual Rig Mapping Works**

Visual mapping is a lot more complicated the auto-rig mapping, so it’s not something you want to jump into immediately. However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:

Manually make connections starting with the joints.

Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.

Motion can then be added to the timeline.

### 05**Finalizing Your Animated Rig**

To finish us off, let’s talk about how you go about publishing your finished product! Of course, even after you have your complex rig completed, there are still other matters to think about in terms of making sure that the video is of quality!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Start off on the right footing by learning the basics of animation! These days, there are more options than ever, with the modern 3D animation rigging style now just as popular as the more classic 2D animation style.

**●** The best way to learn animation rigging is to practice! Structured guides can help you get to the point of almost mastery, but it’s not until you start playing with the tools of your craft that you can truly learn how to create beautiful animations!

**●** Some of the more complex functions of rigging require a lot of patience, so make sure that you always go into your projects with a level-head. And, just to be sure, invest in tools that will help rather than hinder your progress! There are many advanced software out there that can help you improve more easily.

This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of **animate rigging**

To help them out (as well as other **animation rigging** beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!

#### In this article

01 [The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Animate Rigging?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation**

Before anything else, we’ve prepared a bit of an OVERVIEW on rigging in animation. This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.

### 01**What is Rigging in Animation**

Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.

Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) in order to get this done!

![AutoDesk Maya Software Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging1.jpg)

### 02**An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging**

2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!

### 03**An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging**

3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.

In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.

### 04**Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving**

Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:

**Joints|Bones**: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.

**Driven Keys**: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).

**Blend Shapes**: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.

**Inverse Kinematics**: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.

**Forward Kinematics**: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.

**Control Curves**: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.

**Constraint**: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.

**Deformers**: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.

**Skinning**: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.

**Weight Planning**: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.

**Facial Rigging**: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.

## Part 2 **How Do You Animate Rigging?**

Now, onto actually talking about how you can start **animate rigging**. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.

### 01**How to Rig a Simple Character**

This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:

**Step 1: Design Your Character**
