The answer to if the Blender is suitable for animation is yes. **Blender animation** is the best for making animations and bringing any living to animator. This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let's talk about why **Blender 3D animation software** is the best and more helpful.

Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.

There are many animation effects other than animating characters. **Blender 3D for free** has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.

Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.

Blender's animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.

Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.

## Part 2 **How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.**

This is a series for people who want to learn how to create **3D blender animation** characters from keeping a reference image. Blender's ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.

### 01Step 1: Importing

Initially, import a **Blender 3D** **animation** character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.

Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0

Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.

### 02Step 2: Add Keyframes

There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.

Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet 'G' on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.

Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.

### 03Step 3: Get Reference Materials

It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let's discuss how to add it.

Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select "Image" and then choose the "Background." Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.

Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.

### 04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound

This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let's see how to add it.

Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.

There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.

Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let's discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.

Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the "Sound." Now select the sound that you wish to add.

Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between "No Sync" to "AV Sync" in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.

### 05Step 5: Rendering

Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.

Initially, click on "scene" and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as "WebM" and video Codec as "WEBM/VP9\. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to "Vorbis." Choose output quality and speed.

After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select "Render Animation" in **Blender Animation**.

Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using **Blender 3D animation software**. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the **Blender 3D mouse**.

### 01How to Draw Cartoon Characters

We'll go through the fundamentals of human perception before getting into cartoon face drawing. Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.

After making all the edits, you can go to its File > Export feature and save your good night/morning GIF images in a compatible format (to be published on the web).

## Part 2 Create Stunning Good Morning or Night GIFs with Filmora

Since Photoshop can be quite complicated to learn, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora to create videos and GIFs of all sorts. It is a multitrack timeline editing application that offers a wide range of editing options that are super easy to use. Apart from that, you will also get access to a wide range of media assets and effects that you can readily use to create good morning/night animated GIFs.

#### Wondershare Filmora

##### Step 1 Launch Filmora and Load your Files to Create GIFs

You can start by launching Wondershare Filmora on your system and just drag and drop your media files to its interface. Besides that, you can also go to its File > Import menu to browse and load your media files (like morning or night images).

![filmora load media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 Come up with Engaging GIFs using Filmora

Afterward, you can drop these media assets to the timeline at the bottom in a preferred format and start editing them. For instance, you can hover the cursor at the side to use the trimmer tool to clip any unwanted part from the video clip.

![filmora trim gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif)

You can also select any media file and go to its properties to perform all kinds of actions on the selected media file like scaling, repositioning, flipping, rotating, and so on.

![filmora rotate image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/rotate-image-filmorax.jpg)

Many people would like to write quotes and messages on their good night/morning GIF images. In this case, you can go to the “Titles” section of Filmora to add different caption effects to your videos.

![filmora add titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles.jpg)

Besides that, you can also explore a wide range of transitions, stickers, overlays, filters, and numerous other visual effects that you can readily add to your animated good morning/night GIFs.

![filmora filters on windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

##### Step 3 Save your good morning or night GIFs on Filmora

After working on your anime good night/morning GIF, you can click on the “Export” button from the top and choose to save the media file in a GIF format on your system.

![filmora save video as gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/saving-file-in-gif-format-in-filmora-x.jpg)

## Part 3 Create Animated Good Morning/Night GIFs with Canva

Canva is one of the most user-friendly online solutions that you can use to come up with graphics of different styles. From social media posts to posters and video clips to logos, Canva can help you develop all types of customized designs. A while back, it has added a dedicated option to create and edit animations that would let you come up with some stunning good morning/night GIF images.

##### Step 1 Select a Project Type or Template of Canva

At first, you can go to the official website of Canva and choose to work on a template of your choice. Here, you can look for GIFs readily available on Canva or work on an empty canvas.

![canva explore gif templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-10.jpg)

##### Step 2 Customize your Good Morning/Night GIF on Canva

From the sidebar, you can drag and drop various elements, captions, borders, and other objects to develop an animated good morning/night GIF. Several other features in Canva would let you customize and edit your GIFs easily.

![canva gif editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-11.jpg)

##### Step 3 Export your Designs as GIFs from Canva

That’s it! After working on all the features of your good night/morning funny GIFs, you can click on the “Export” button from the top and save your GIF on your system’s local storage from Canva.

![canva export as gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-12.jpg)

## Part 4 Find Readily Available Good Morning/Night GIFs

If you are running short on time and can’t come up with any good morning/night animated GIF, then you can pick them from the following resources:

### 1\. Tenor

Tenor is certainly one of the most prominent websites to find GIFs and stickers of all kinds. Therefore, you can head to its official website and look for good morning/night animations by entering relevant keywords on the search bar. Later, you can download the GIF or directly share its link with others.

![enor good morning gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-13.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

Like Tenor, Giphy is another popular source where you can find hundreds of good night/morning funny GIFs. The website is quite easy to navigate and will let you see all kinds of GIFs by entering appropriate keywords. Later, you can directly copy the URL of the GIF and share it with others on platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram.

![giphy good morning gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-14.jpg)

### 3\. Gifer

Lastly, you can also explore Gifer to find an extensive collection of inspiring or funny good night/morning GIFs. The website has already listed GIFs in different categories that you can explore to save time or can enter keywords on the search bar to find appropriate content.

![filmorax boxpng ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png)

**AI Portrait – The best feature of Wondershare Filmora for gameplay editing**

The AI Portrait is a new add-on in Wondershare Filmora. It can easily remove video backgrounds without using a green screen or chroma key, allowing you to add borders, glitch effects, pixelated, noise, or segmentation video effects.

![ai portrait wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-multiple-ai-portrait-add-on.jpg)

### Conclusion

After reading this guide, I’m sure that you can easily pick or create all kinds of good night/morning GIFs. While Photoshop can make animated good morning/night GIFs, it is certainly not that user-friendly. That’s why I would recommend using a reliable and friendly application like Wondershare Filmora to meet your requirements. The media-editing tool has an extensive range of assets and offers tons of high-end features to come up with all sorts of inspiring, romantic, or funny good morning/night GIFs.
