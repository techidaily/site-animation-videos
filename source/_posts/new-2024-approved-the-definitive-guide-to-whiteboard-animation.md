## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.

#### In this article

01 [Definition of 2D Animation 3D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [Key Differences Between 2D Animations and 3D Animations](#Part 2)

03 [Selecting Between 2D Animation and 3D Animation?](#Part 3)

04 [Merging 2D Animation and 3D Animation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.

| Features/Type of Animation | 2D Animation                                                                                               | 3D Animation                                                                                               |

Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.

Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

Toy Story was the first 3D animation movie and after that, there is no stopping. Though 3D animations are more interesting and engaging, they are fields where 2D animations work better. This article will help you to learn in detail about 2D 3D animation, their differences, uses, and other aspects.

01 [Definition of 2D Animation 3D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [Key Differences Between 2D Animations and 3D Animations](#Part 2)

03 [Selecting Between 2D Animation and 3D Animation?](#Part 3)

04 [Merging 2D Animation and 3D Animation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.

| Features/Type of Animation | 2D Animation                                                                                               | 3D Animation                                                                                               |

## Part 3 Selecting Between 2D Animation and 3D Animation?

Confused between 2D animation and 3D animation? Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.

**●** Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.

**●** Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.

**●** Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.

## Part 4 Part Merging 2D Animation and 3D Animation

Why choose one, when both can be used? Yes, to get the best of both worlds, 2D animations can be used along with 3D animations depending on the type of the project. Both the styles can be adjusted as per the requirements and for this, good professional software is needed.

This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn't make it any less fun

The story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.
