This article covers all the relevant information related to **still motion animation**, paper motion animation, liquid motion animation. The name may vary, but such motions come under stop motion or **still motion** techniques to a great extent.

## Part 1 Guide to Learn What is Still Motion Animation

![Still motion creation 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/still-motion-animation-image-1.jpg)

**Still motion animation** is also known as **walking motion animation and stalk motion animation** used to boost a scene in animation. It comes in a frame-to-frame outlook. It can be a booster in horror movies, comedy, and thrillers. It used to express flashbacks, dreams, and summaries of a long scene. Sometimes it could be slower, faster, fade, blur or split frames to discover/show unconscious scenes.

## Part 2 6 Most Satisfying Still Motion Animation examples

Before moving ahead with detailing how to process **still motion animation**, let's try to understand it with some out-of-the-box examples to make you know what **liquid motion animation** is with the following criteria?

### 01Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer

![Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/still-motion-animation-image-2.jpg)

The famous, Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer, is a 19Christmas movie that shows **stop motion animation** first. The class one-hour program special mentions many people's first exposure to the stop motion that Rudolph especially showed, Yukon Cornelius, Sam the snowman, etc. In everlasting memory of Rudolph, people still mention the Island of Misfit Toys and wonder what that seemingly-normal ragdoll is doing there.

### 02A town called Panic (2009)

![A town called Panic (2009) 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/still-motion-animation-image-3.jpg)

Based on the Belgian puppet on a series of identical names, this demented feature seems to star the playthings you would find packed away with an old model plaything. The plot illustrates how boyish Cowboy and Indian want to offer a birthday gift to their housemate and seemingly surrogate parent, Horse, resulting in mishaps at birthday parties, the frozen north, and also the bottom of the ocean. The persistently surreal feature includes equine music teachers, giant robotic penguins, and livestock used as cannon-fodder. Still, instead of becoming overwhelming annoying, a town called Panic sustains its gleefulness over the long run.

### 03Chicken Run (1994)

![Chicken Run (1994)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/still-motion-animation-image-4.jpg)

Chicken Run is a **still/stop motion animation** comedy film produced by Pathe Aardman and Dreamwork animations. It's a 20stop-motion animated movie. The plot focuses on a group of chickens who see poultry named Rocky as their hope to vacate the farm when their owners prepare to show them chicken meat tarts. He manages to help them in an adventurous, funny way which makes the movie best. Its sequel started developing in 2020.
