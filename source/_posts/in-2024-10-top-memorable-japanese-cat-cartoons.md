Adobe Animate is Adobe's very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

![After Effects: Animators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png)

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

![Per Character 3D Text Properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know5.png)

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

![Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know6.png)

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.

If what you’re searching for is a **3D GIF Maker**, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.

## Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs

First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some **3D GIF Maker** tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of **3D GIF Maker** tools and **3D GIF Generator** tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.

### 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first **3D GIF Maker** on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a **3D GIF Maker**, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.

 **Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)**

### 022\. Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere **3D GIF Maker**. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.

The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.

### 03EaseUS Video Editor

Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a **3D GIF Creator** quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.

The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)

## Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a **3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker**, and so on.)

### 01Step 1: Launch **[Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

First things first, launch the **3D GIF maker** that you intend to use. In our case, that is Filmora (a screenshot has been provided below for your edification and reference. We’ll be using Filmora as our example.)

### 02Step 2: Upload File(s)

Next, upload the file or files that you want to turn into a GIF.

As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media > Import Media File. However, you can also drag and drop your file(s) on the designated area of the UI..

![Upload Files to Create GIF](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-3-ways-to-create-gif-images-with-great-3d-gif-maker5.png)

### 03Step 3: Drag Uploaded Media to Timeline

To create a GIF withFilmora , you’ll need to first create a video. Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.

Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked \[1\] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked \[2\] in the image below) in order to create a video.

![Drag Media onto Timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-3-ways-to-create-gif-images-with-great-3d-gif-maker6.png)

### 04Step 4: (Optional) Edit Video

If you want, take this opportunity to work on your video some more before converting it into a GIF. Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:

**●**Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.

**●**Add Text or audio to video.

**●**Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.

**●**Add transitions for better video flow.

And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.

### 05Step 5: Create Video > GIF

Once you’re done editing your video, you can now convert it to a GIF.

This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.

The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.

### 03EaseUS Video Editor

Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a **3D GIF Creator** quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.

The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)

## Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

If you want, take this opportunity to work on your video some more before converting it into a GIF. Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:

**●**Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.

**●**Add Text or audio to video.

**●**Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.

And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.

![Edit Video for Conversion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-3-ways-to-create-gif-images-with-great-3d-gif-maker7.png)
