**Step 2: Script Your Presentation**

Start with creating a preset content for every slide of your presentation, based on the reason behind creating the slideshow, type and style of content presentation and so on.

**Step 2: Add a Cohesive Background Music**

You can complement your presentation with the perfect background music from the Powtoon library, from the web or even create your own voiceover recording through any preferred online text-to-voice recorder tool to voice the contents of your presentation. When you are done, upload your recording to the Powtoon editor to proceed with adding visual content to the presentation.

**Step 3: Divide Your Presentation Slides**

You can now add images, text and animations to your project in line with your presentation script. Choose suitable images from your device or from the web, add short, impactful texts and stunning animations from the Powtoon’s library to level up the appearance of your slideshow.

**Step 4: Include Design Elements**

Try adding additional elements like, graphics, background themes, animation styles, props, color schemes and other relevant characteristics to the slides.

**Step 5: Time Your Presentation**

In the last step, use the Powtoon timeline to set the sequence and time of appearance of different elements in each of your presentation slides.
