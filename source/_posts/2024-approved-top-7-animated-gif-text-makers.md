## Part 1 The Difference Between A Video And A Gif

A GIF is a lot in use these days over social media platforms, and other online sites. Standing for Graphics Interchange Format, a GIF is basically a looping animation or a video that has a sequence of frames or images.

Though a lot of people can consider a GIF as a short video, there are a few key differences between the two. The first one lies in the name extension. A GIF file is saved as .gif while a video can be saved into several formats like .mp4, .mov, and more.

A video contains visual information having good quality frames as well as sound while a GIF is a short animation that uses some specific information created from a sequence of frames. Moreover, a GIF does not have a sound and the size is also very small.
