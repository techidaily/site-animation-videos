Animation is a skill that you need years to practice. However, the learning process can be boosted if you master some animation tips. If you’re looking for great 2D/3D animation tips and tricks, this is what we will offer here.

There are some overlaps between 2D and 3D animation tips like practicing and object pose, but in essence, animation tips can be learned commonly.

These animation tips will help you make your 2D and 3D animations as bold and creative as possible, while reduce your workload and enable you to get your work out into the world quicker with [excellent animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Let’s take a look at the top 10 **2D/3D animation tips and tricks** right now.

## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

![2d animaiton reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reference.JPG)

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

![animation tips simplicity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simplicity.JPG)

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

![2D draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/draw-animation.jpg)

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

![feedback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feedback.JPG)

## Part 2: 3D Animation Tips for Beginners

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

![focus your frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-your-frame.JPG)

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

![ criticism](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/criticism.JPG)

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

![3D animation tips model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/model.JPG)

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

You can learn animation on your own, but that's not the best way. We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

![2d animaiton reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reference.JPG)

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

![animation tips simplicity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simplicity.JPG)

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

![2D draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/draw-animation.jpg)

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

![feedback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feedback.JPG)

## Part 2: 3D Animation Tips for Beginners

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

![focus your frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-your-frame.JPG)

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

![ criticism](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/criticism.JPG)

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

![3D animation tips model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/model.JPG)

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the increasing popularity of Smartphones, people these days are experiencing all new things with lots of excitement. And GIFs are always the most interesting content for them. When we talk about limited band width and fast loading time solutions then GIFs are the first options in front of our eyes. These files use to have small size so they can be transferred and downloaded with ease and at faster rate. If you are interested to know about various resizing concepts related to GIFs then the article below can be helpful for you.

## How to reduce GIF size?

There are so many things that contribute in managing overall size of GIFs. The list includes the colour count inside, dimensions of images that you have used for development of GIFs and number of frames included inside one GIF folder. In case if it is an animated GIF then size may increase accordingly. Somehow, if you become able to optimize your Gifs then it is much easier to share them over internet.

Photoshop is a great tool to edit your image, including gif images. Here we are going to show you how to make your GIF smaller in Photoshop.

 **1\. Crop away any extra space around the image:**

The very first task for users is to bring your GIF video file onto Photoshop timeline. Sometimes, it is not essential to update whole series of your GIF animation to the library, the GIF can be simply trimmed at timeline panel. One needs to turn on loop option and then be active enough to allocate the right place to trim your video.

 **2\. Reduce dimensions of Output:**

Those who are working on Photoshop CC 2017 version will be able to develop GIFs by simply executing Explore As option from menu. To do this, they need to move to files and then from drop down menu select Export as. Soon a menu will open where you need to choose your output file format as GIF and adjust weight and height parameter to reduce physical dimensions of your image.

In case if you are using Adobe Photoshop Elements 14 then on its interface, users need to move to File and then hit Save for Web option. It will help to open a Save for Web type dialogue box immediately, on this new window you can apply desired changes to physical dimensions of your content, reduce color information and apply dithering etc.

 **3\. Adjust number of colors in image:**

PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

#### In this article

01 [6 Animated Powerpoint Templates with Interactive Features](#Part 1)

02 [How to Create a Moving Animation in Powerpoint](#Part 2)

03 [10 Moving Animation Powerpoint Techniques](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

### 02[**Move Animated PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/move-animated-powerpoint-template-AY6RG6D)

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

Again, we have another modern and minimalistic kind of PowerPoint template with ‘40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint.’ It comes with 40 modern slides, all of which come fully animated are easy enough to customize with your own branding or content.

![40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques3.png)

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

![UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques4.png)

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

This next PowerPoint template is most suited for businesses looking to promote their products. The creator of the template has provided five different colored versions of the template, each with 30 unique slides that were carefully sectioned with suitable animations.

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

![Add Animation - Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques21.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

![Company Presentation PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques1.png)

### 02[**Move Animated PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/move-animated-powerpoint-template-AY6RG6D)

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

![Company Presentation PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques1.png)

### 02[**Move Animated PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/move-animated-powerpoint-template-AY6RG6D)

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

![Move Animated PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques2.png)

### 03[**40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint**](https://elements.envato.com/40-animated-conceptual-slides-for-powerpoint-QAANXAP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3OxV0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

Again, we have another modern and minimalistic kind of PowerPoint template with ‘40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint.’ It comes with 40 modern slides, all of which come fully animated are easy enough to customize with your own branding or content.

![40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques3.png)

### 04[**UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)**](https://elements.envato.com/unigraph-animated-creative-template-pptx-8V8DBFR?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O220U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

![UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques4.png)

### 05[**Graph & Charts PowerPoint Presentation**](https://elements.envato.com/graph-charts-powerpoint-presentation-QU6MKBV?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2UIU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

![Graphs & Charts PowerPoint Presentation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques5.png)

### 06[**Laststyle - PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/laststyle-powerpoint-template-2BGADZ7?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2X0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

This next PowerPoint template is most suited for businesses looking to promote their products. The creator of the template has provided five different colored versions of the template, each with 30 unique slides that were carefully sectioned with suitable animations.

![Laststyle - PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques6.png)

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

![Add Animation - Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques21.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH."

No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc.

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

02 [The 10 Best Cartoon Shows Since the Simpsons](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **Do You Remember the Very Popular Simpsons?**

The Simpsons is an American animated cartoonist Matt Groening created for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a "golden age."

The **popular cartoon** series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.

However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750\. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.

Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.

However, here are the ten best cartoon shows that have existed since the Simpsons:

### 01Futurama

This **popular cartoon** series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that's pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-3.jpg)

### 02The Critic

This cartoon series was first created in 1994 by the Simpson's writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss. This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor's non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz's Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-4.jpg)

### 03Bojack Horseman

Bojack Horseman is a **dumb cartoon character** series first created on August 22, 2014\. However, four (4) days later, the series was renewed for a second season, released on July 17, 2015\. It is often a searing portrait of addiction, failure, depression, etc., as humans talk to a horse.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-5.jpg)

### 04Family Guy

Family Guy, the **snoopy cartoon** series, was first created on January 31, 1999, which goes for anything for a laugh style. However, you might not like the Griffin family or the other residents of Quahog, but you have to admit that the show stumbles on a great joke.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-6.jpg)

### 05South Park

South Park debuted with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe, " first created on August 13, 1997\. Although it started with some cheap animations, it has become one of the iconic animated shows.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-7.jpg)

### 06Batman: The Animated Series

The Batman animated cartoon series, created on September 5, 1992, is a favorite for many people, although it is more comedy than an animated drama.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-8.jpg)

### 07Gravity Falls

This cartoon animated series was first created on June 15, 2012, and is a mystery story about a few kids with a supernatural bend.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 07](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-9.jpg)

### 08Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

This **popular cartoon** animated series was first created in 1983 by cartoonists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. This cartoon series is the definitive version, brightly colored and fun and fluffy.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 08](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-10.jpg)

### 09Doug

This cartoon animated series was first created on March 26, 1999, by Jim Jinkins and produced by Jumbo Pictures. It was one of the first animated shows on Nickelodeon before moving to Disney pictures. However, this show is creative and down-to-earth at the same time.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 09](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-11.jpg)

### 10Hey Arnold

This cartoon animated series came in on October 7, 1996\. This show was the second after the first wave of the Nickelodeon show. It was the best of the bunch, and I liked the evolved version of "Doug."

## Part 1 **Do You Remember the Very Popular Simpsons?**

The Simpsons is an American animated cartoonist Matt Groening created for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The Simpsons began in 1987 as a short cartoon shot on The Tracey Ullman Show and received acclamation throughout its early seasons in the 1990s, which are generally considered a "golden age."

The **popular cartoon** series is a satirical depiction of American life epitomized by the Simpson family, consisting of Bart, Homer, Lisa, Marge, and Maggie. In addition, the show is set to run on television, and the human condition and the fictional town of Springfield parody American culture and society.

However, the Simpsons is a combined production by 20th Television and Gracie Films. Also, on March 3, 2021, the series got renewed for seasons 33 and 34, with 22 episodes for each. Thus, increasing the number of episodes from 706 to 750\. Furthermore, its thirty-third (33rd) season came on September 26, 2021.

Before now, the Simpsons was the longest-running American animated cartoon series, an American sitcom, and American scripted primetime television series awarded in terms of seasons and number of episodes.

### 01Futurama

This **popular cartoon** series, first released on March 28, 1999, is a cartoon series about utopian or dystopian. The central concept of this series is that it dares to imagine a future that's pretty similar to the present using a bunch of crazy technology and space travel. Aside from being pretty, it is also hilarious.

![best cartoon shows since the simpsons 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/top-10-popular-cartoons-3.jpg)

### 02The Critic

This cartoon series was first created in 1994 by the Simpson's writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss. This cartoon has ramped up its predecessor's non sequitur and sight-gag humor featuring Jon Lovitz's Jay Sherman, an unfortunate portmanteau of Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.

### 04Family Guy

Family Guy, the **snoopy cartoon** series, was first created on January 31, 1999, which goes for anything for a laugh style. However, you might not like the Griffin family or the other residents of Quahog, but you have to admit that the show stumbles on a great joke.
