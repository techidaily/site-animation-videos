03 [The Best 8 Places for High-Quality Royalty Free Gifs (Paid and Free)](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 2 **Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?**

All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not **copyright-free GIFs.** However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.

Animes have been one of the widely enjoyed forms of entertainment by people all over the world for decades. There are certain animes that attract people due to their scariness and the characters in them.

Even though girls are usually displayed as cute and pinkish and lovely, some animes display them as creepy. And believe me, these creepy anime girls have a huge fan base and are capable of giving the audience a chill over the spine while watching them.

The creepiness of the anime girls adds to the horror of animes and people enjoy watching them. So let’s find out more about these scary anime girls and why their scary character is loved by the fans.

## 10 Scary Anime Girls in the Scary Animes

There are a lot of animes with different genres. But some of the animes have some characters that stand out due to their weirdness and creepiness. Let’s talk about 10 such scary anime girls that still give the audience creeps:

* [1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)](#part1)
* [2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)](#part2)
* [3\. Sachiko Shinozaki (Corpse Party)](#part3)
* [4\. Shiro (Deadman Wonderland)](#part4)
* [5\. Megumi Shimizu (Shiki)](#part5)
* [6\. Esdeath (Akame Ga Kill!)](#part6)
* [7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)](#part7)
* [8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)](#part8)
* [9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)](#part9)
* [10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)](#part10)

### 1\. Ai Enma (Hell Girl)

Ai Enma is one of the cute-looking characters in Hell Girl, but do not be deceived by her looks. She was a girl who was buried alive when she was seven, by her own villagers. Enma crawled out of the ground and burned the entire village, killing every single person living there as an act of vengeance.

Later as a punishment for her horrific doings, she was cast out and sentenced to live out her afterlife as Hell Girl. Still, in her childhood, Ai was assigned the job of dragging dead souls to hell, whether they deserved it or not. The coldness in her eyes and the way she does things without a shiver is what makes her creepy.

### 2\. Shion Sonozaki (Higurashi: When They Cry)

Shion Sonozaki from Higurashi: When They Cry is a dark character who is not exactly what she seems outside. The town she lives in is cursed and she is trying to break that dark cycle that offers only death and tragedy.

### 10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)

Lucy in Elfen Lied is a character that sometimes gets sympathy and other times creeps the audience out. She has difficulty drawing a line between good and evil. She can be seen as being sadistically tormented and ruthlessly tormenting about the cruelty around her.

Her surroundings and the people are responsible for how she is and that is why despite being creepy she is loved by a lot of people.
