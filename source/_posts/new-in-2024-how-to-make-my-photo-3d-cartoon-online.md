PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

#### In this article

01 [6 Animated Powerpoint Templates with Interactive Features](#Part 1)

02 [How to Create a Moving Animation in Powerpoint](#Part 2)

03 [10 Moving Animation Powerpoint Techniques](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

![UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques4.png)

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

![Add Animation - Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques21.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

![Company Presentation PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques1.png)

### 02[**Move Animated PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/move-animated-powerpoint-template-AY6RG6D)

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

![Move Animated PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques2.png)

### 03[**40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint**](https://elements.envato.com/40-animated-conceptual-slides-for-powerpoint-QAANXAP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3OxV0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

Again, we have another modern and minimalistic kind of PowerPoint template with ‘40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint.’ It comes with 40 modern slides, all of which come fully animated are easy enough to customize with your own branding or content.

![40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques3.png)

### 04[**UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)**](https://elements.envato.com/unigraph-animated-creative-template-pptx-8V8DBFR?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O220U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

![UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques4.png)

### 05[**Graph & Charts PowerPoint Presentation**](https://elements.envato.com/graph-charts-powerpoint-presentation-QU6MKBV?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2UIU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

![Graphs & Charts PowerPoint Presentation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques5.png)

### 06[**Laststyle - PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/laststyle-powerpoint-template-2BGADZ7?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2X0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

This next PowerPoint template is most suited for businesses looking to promote their products. The creator of the template has provided five different colored versions of the template, each with 30 unique slides that were carefully sectioned with suitable animations.

![Laststyle - PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques6.png)

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH."

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It's a good way of starting if you're not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won't demand any immediate monetary commitment.

Now, as for its features, today, we'll be focusing on **Blender Rigging** features.

02 [The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]](#Part 2)

03 [Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Use Blender Rigging?**

**Blender Character Rigging** is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it's capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.

So, if you want to create video projects for your audience's entertainment or edification with animation, then **Blender Rigging** is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished **Blender Rigging** animations.)

![Blender Character Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes1.png)

## Part 2 **The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]**

For this next section, we're going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about **Blender Character Rigging**, **Blender Facial Rigging**, **Blender Muscle Rig**, and so on.

These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we've linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it's something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender' experience.)

### 01**Blender Character Rigging**

The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, **Blender Character Rigging**. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy **Blender character rigging**, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.

### 02**Blender Facial Rigging**

Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about **Blender Facial Rigging** from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of **Blender Rigging** tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face's character to become animated.)

### 03**Blender Muscle Rigging**

Creating a **Blender Muscle Rig** is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage' as you say, with your Animations. The video that we've attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of **Blender Rigging** in general and has extensively explained how to create a **Blender Human Rig** from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.

### 04**Blender Rigging**

Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional' methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It's an especially good skill to learn if you're more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)

### 05**Blender Rigging**

This next tutorial is an introduction to basic **Blender Rigging**. It's a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.

## Part 3 **Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course**

For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about **Blender Rigging**. Whether it be about **Blender character rigging**, **Blender facial rigging**, **free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs**, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.

### 01**Where to Learn the Course?**

The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters' **blender rigging** course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.

### 02**Other Tools to Learn Rigging**

As for other places to learn? We suggest the "Blender Fundamentals" course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is "Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of **Blender rigging** (including **Blender rigging** and **Blender rigging** videos.)

![Blender Fundamentals on YouTube. By Blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes3.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in trying out **blender rigging** yourself, you'll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.

**●** Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.

**●** For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common **Blender Rigging** subjects.

**●** If you're looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master's introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender's own "Blender Fundamental" series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you'll need to know.)

### 01Charlie

Charlie Brown, known as Charlie, is the main character in the comic strip Peanuts. This is a widely recognized American cartoon. Many people can relate to Charlie. Charlie is shy, nervous, and lacks confidence. These characteristics make him relatable to a chunk of common people. Charlie is referred to as the "Loveable Loser."Charlie is an overwhelmingly short and stout character physically. Have you ever imagined how Charlie's skeleton version would look?

### 02Fred Flintstone

I have known very few people who do not know about Fred Flintstone. Fred Flinstone is the protagonist of the famous American sitcom show Yabba-Dabba-Dinosaurs and the entire franchise. The Flinstone is another show that features Fred with his family. Of course, the show's main attraction is the Flinstone family and the way this show is set. This show is set in a way that romanticizes a family living in a cave. Coming to talk about skeletons, have you ever thought that what if a **skeleton cartoon show** version of The Flintstone were made. How would this short, fat man with almost a square look as a skeleton? We can look up here how the skeleton version of Fred Flintstone looks:

### 04Dexter

Dexter is the protagonist in the show Dexter's Laboratory. Dexter is one of the most outstanding kid scientists who have made great inventions in his secret laboratory.

Dexter is a short young boy with curly hair. Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious. But this is how Dexter would look like a **skeleton cartoon.**

It has been used to fashion dresses, bags, and many more. How would it be if we sat to think of a skeleton version of this furry creature? This may not a pleasant experience for everyone. The perfect way to demonstrate pikachu as a skeleton version would be:

## Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Skeletons With Step by Step

Have you ever tried drawing **a skeleton cartoon character**? You can use a **skeleton cartoon** to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw **skeleton cartoon**. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:

**Step 1:** To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let's start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.

**Step 2:** The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.

![start with head skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.

**Step 4:** To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body's center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.

**Step 5:** After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.

![draw ribs skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-7.jpg)

**Step 6:** After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.

**Step 7:** The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.

**Step 8:** Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.

**Step 9:** Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

**Step 11:** After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.

**Step 12:** To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.

**Step 13:** Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.

**Step 14:** After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.

![draw upper half of the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-9.jpg)

**Step 15:** Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.

**Step 16:** After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.

**Step 17:** Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.

**Step 18:** Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.

![add feet skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-10.jpg)

**Step 19:** You can color your skeleton drawing or give your shading style after your skeleton drawing is done.

You can make quirky **skeleton cartoon** animations and compile them to a video, adding music effects. You might think you need different apps for the video and the audio editing part. That might be the case for other apps. Here is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**; you can edit your video, make slideshows, and edit the background sound score.

### 02Fred Flintstone

I have known very few people who do not know about Fred Flintstone. Fred Flinstone is the protagonist of the famous American sitcom show Yabba-Dabba-Dinosaurs and the entire franchise. The Flinstone is another show that features Fred with his family. Of course, the show's main attraction is the Flinstone family and the way this show is set. This show is set in a way that romanticizes a family living in a cave. Coming to talk about skeletons, have you ever thought that what if a **skeleton cartoon show** version of The Flintstone were made. How would this short, fat man with almost a square look as a skeleton? We can look up here how the skeleton version of Fred Flintstone looks:

### 03Bubbles

The Bubble is one of the main characters of the popular TV cartoon show Powerpuff girls. The other protagonists are Blossom and Buttercup, her sisters. The Bubble is named Bubble because she is the bubbliest and most fun-loving among the three sisters. Bubble is a sweet little girl with a round face and big round eyes and short limbs. These characteristics in this character make it look cuter. But to think, how would we imagine Bubble in a skeleton version. This is how Bubble would look like a skeleton.

### 04Dexter

Dexter is the protagonist in the show Dexter's Laboratory. Dexter is one of the most outstanding kid scientists who have made great inventions in his secret laboratory. It would be more appropriate to call Dexter an anti-heroic protagonist. He works in his secret laboratory for various projects like stopping bullying worldwide. Dexter is a short young boy with curly hair. Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious. But this is how Dexter would look like a **skeleton cartoon.**

### 05Pikachu

Pikachu is one of the characters or one of the Pokémons in the famous animated Japanese series Pokémon. Pikachu is a small yellow furry Pokémon. It seems very sweet to the audience and the general public, but it acquires a dangerous skill to give out an electric shock. This small yellow furry creature has featured in many films with the protagonist of the famous show Pokémon Ash Ketchum. This cartoon character has a presence in the fashion industry. It has been used to fashion dresses, bags, and many more. How would it be if we sat to think of a skeleton version of this furry creature? This may not a pleasant experience for everyone. The perfect way to demonstrate pikachu as a skeleton version would be:

## Part 2 How to Draw Cartoon Skeletons With Step by Step

Have you ever tried drawing **a skeleton cartoon character**? You can use a **skeleton cartoon** to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw **skeleton cartoon**. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:

**Step 1:** To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let's start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.

**Step 2:** The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.

![start with head skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.

**Step 4:** To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body's center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.

**Step 5:** After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.

![draw ribs skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-7.jpg)

**Step 6:** After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.

**Step 7:** The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.

**Step 8:** Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.

**Step 9:** Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.

**Step 10:** Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.

![draw arms skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-8.jpg)

**Step 11:** After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.

**Step 12:** To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.

**Step 13:** Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.

**Step 14:** After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.

![draw upper half of the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-9.jpg)

**Step 15:** Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.

**Step 16:** After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.

**Step 17:** Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.

**Step 18:** Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.

![add feet skeleton cartoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-skeleton-cartoon-a-step-by-step-guide-10.jpg)

**Step 19:** You can color your skeleton drawing or give your shading style after your skeleton drawing is done.

You can make quirky **skeleton cartoon** animations and compile them to a video, adding music effects. You might think you need different apps for the video and the audio editing part. That might be the case for other apps.
