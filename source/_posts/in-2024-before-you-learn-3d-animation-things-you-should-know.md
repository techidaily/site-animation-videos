Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

![2d animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3danimation-01.jpeg)

animations are like the ones Dreamworks, Pixar, produce. They include the avengers, the bad guys, etc.

Several 3D animation software exists in the market, both free and paid. If you are a **animation** creator or love animation for fun, you can use the free software to make your videos, **cartoon photos, 3d cartoon faces,** etc.

With many **animation** software available in the market, you can only fully trust a few.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

If what you’re searching for is a **3D GIF Maker**, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.

01 [Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs](#Part 1)

02 [Create 3D animated GIFs online with Filmora](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs

First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some **3D GIF Maker** tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of **3D GIF Maker** tools and **3D GIF Generator** tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.

### 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first **3D GIF Maker** on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a **3D GIF Maker**, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.

 **Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)**

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 022\. Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere **3D GIF Maker**. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.

The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.

### 03EaseUS Video Editor

Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a **3D GIF Creator** quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.

The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)

## Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a **3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker**, and so on.)

### 02Step 2: Upload File(s)

Next, upload the file or files that you want to turn into a GIF.

As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media > Import Media File. However, you can also drag and drop your file(s) on the designated area of the UI..

**●**Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.

**●**Add Text or audio to video.

**●**Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.

And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.

Once you’re done editing your video, you can now convert it to a GIF.

## Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs

First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some **3D GIF Maker** tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of **3D GIF Maker** tools and **3D GIF Generator** tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.

### 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first **3D GIF Maker** on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a **3D GIF Maker**, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.

 **Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)**

### 022\. Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere **3D GIF Maker**. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.

The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.

### 03EaseUS Video Editor

Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a **3D GIF Creator** quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.

The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)

## Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

## Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?

A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry. These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.

## Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations

3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.

### 01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients

Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his/her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.

### 02Training Of Medical Professionals

Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.

### 03Educating New Professionals

For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.

### 04Used As A Marketing Tool

Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.

### 05Marketing To Medical Professional

While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.

![3D Medical Animation Uses](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/all-about-3d-medical-animation-and-its-uses-02.jpg)

## Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?

A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry. These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.

## Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations

3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.

### 01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients

Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his/her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.

### 02Training Of Medical Professionals

Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.

### 03Educating New Professionals

For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.

### 04Used As A Marketing Tool

Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.

### 05Marketing To Medical Professional

While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.
