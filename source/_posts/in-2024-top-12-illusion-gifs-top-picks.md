02 [Best 12 Illusion Gifs](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?

GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.

Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.

These are now used as everything from advertisements to commentary from all walks of life. The users of GIFs seem to be endless! They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.

## Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs

This curated list will help you to know the best **Illusion GIF** that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-

### 01Van Gogh Stare GIF

The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the "dazzle camouflage," is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye's instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.

### 02This brain-busting rotation

We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can't see it from every angle.

### 03This loop tea GIF

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE)

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj)

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik)

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE)

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj)

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik)

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

**Stars**: 7.9

**Votes**: 13,266

**Summary:** The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, 'Star vs. the Forces of Evil' This is an American animated 'magical-girl' television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.

**Duration**: 1995 \[78 min\]

**Genre**: Animation, Adventure, Comedy

**Rating**: G

**Metascore**: N/A

**Director**: Kevin Lima

**Stars**: 6.9

Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show. It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it's not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it's sure to provide a good time

In any case, the nostalgia factor is strong with this one The series has inspired many adaptations. And, with its revival on Disney XD in 2015, its popularity has only continued to grow

This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn't make it any less fun

**Stars**: 8.1

**Votes**: 7,522

**Summary:** While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), 'The Owl House' is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)

The story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.

02 [How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?](#Part 2)

03 [Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's Adobe Auto Rigger?**

Alright, so what is the **Adobe Auto Rigger** and how does it differ from **Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging** or **Adobe After Effects Rigging**? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.

It's all thanks to the third-party tool, **Mixamo**, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually **rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects**.) We'll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.

Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you're intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

![Upload Custom Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome2.png)

### 02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters

The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters' tab (shown in the image below.)

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

![Browse for Auto-Rigged Characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome3.png)

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

![Adobe 3D Rigging with Mixamo Adobe Auto Rigger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome4.png)

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.
