02 [Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder](#Part 2)

03 [Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films](#Part 3)

04 [How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?**

First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.

### 01**What is a Stop Motion Movie?**

The best way to introduce the concept of **stop motion animation movies** is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.

It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it's the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing 'motion' by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.

### 02**What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?**

There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever **stop motion movie** to be made? Which was "The Humpty Dumpty Circus" created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter's dolls.

You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Rudolph the Reindeer." And finally. You have "Chicken Run" which is considered the best performing **stop motion movie** of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.

## Part 2 **Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder**

Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the **stop motion movies** of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?

### 01**Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with **Lego Movie stop motion** animation. This **stop motion movie** animation style, also called 'Brickfilms', is the practice of using Lego to create **stop motion animation movies**. It's been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.

It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.

### 02**3D Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Alright, so how about 3D **stop motion movies**? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it's actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).

In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called "Tune with Tomorrow" but you might be more familiar with the title "Coraline."

## Part 3 **Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films**

Now for our list of the best **stop motion animation movies** of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the **stop motion movies** on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.

### 01**Coraline (2009)**

We mentioned this **stop motion movie** previously, but in case you haven't already watched it, it's a classic. The storytelling elements of "Coraline" really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn't all that it was chalked up to be.

### 02**The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)**

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is another **stop motion animation movie** that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington's obsession with ruining Christmas.

### 03**Chicken Run (1994)**

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.

### 04**Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)**

The next film, released in the same year as "Coraline", is called "Fantastic Mr. Fox." This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, 'Mr. Fox' and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.

### 05**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)**

Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.

### 06**Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)**

From the makers of Coraline is the **stop motion animation movie**, called "Kubo and The Two Strings" (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It's quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.

### 07**Alice (1988)**

This next stop motion film is quite unique. It's called "Alice" and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.

### 08**8\. Mary and Max (2009)**

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised 'tutorial'. It won't be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how **stop motion movies** are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Stop motion animation is a classic way of telling a story of fantastical characters and settings without having to draw everything frame by frame.

**●** It offers any film a very distinctive style that a lot of lovers of the classics find themselves constantly seeking out.

**●** If you go through the list that we organized out of some of the best **stop motion movies** in film history, you'll notice that they're all quite acclaimed for their masterful storytelling and fun graphics (which, before the creation of 3D animation as we know it today, was the height of entertainment.)

**●** This classic art form can be accomplished by just about anyone with the right equipment and a little bit of effort. It takes some patience, as we hoped to have explained in our tutorial, but the effort is worth the sense of fulfillment that comes when a story told in stills turns into a masterful animation that brings static objects and characters to life.

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen. It features quite a varied cast of chickens in a poultry farm all aiming to make an escape by learning how to fly.

### 04**Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)**

The next film, released in the same year as "Coraline", is called "Fantastic Mr. Fox." This was directed by Wes Anderson, who goes on to tell the story of the main character, 'Mr. Fox' and how his misadventures involving some of the local farmers in the area got—not only himself—but also his family in danger.

### 05**Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)**

Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer is another holiday classic. This one is a lot older than some of the films on this list but is no doubt just as well-known (and perhaps even more so when you consider the older generation.) Much like the nightmare before Christmas, you can usually find this film airing sometime during the holidays on any one channel.

### 06**Kubo and The Two Strings (2016)**

From the makers of Coraline is the **stop motion animation movie**, called "Kubo and The Two Strings" (2016). It tells the story of Kubo, who goes on a search for a suit of magical armor in an effort to destroy an evil plaguing him. It's quite a beautiful film and is critically acclaimed for the level of effort that went in to making sure that it was produced in a way that honored the timeless art of stop motion.

### 07**Alice (1988)**

This next stop motion film is quite unique. It's called "Alice" and it was released sometime in the late 1980s. The fun part of this story is that it begins with a live actress playing Alice. In fact, even the rabbit that leads her to wonderland, and eventually turns her into a porcelain doll, was a taxidermized hare that escaped from its display case. In this way, the stop motion aspect of the story is integrated in a fun way that matches the mood of the rest of the hypnotic story to come.

### 08**8\. Mary and Max (2009)**

Another **stop motion movie** that had been released in 2009 (a big year in stop motion animation) is called "Mary and Max." This one tells the story of a young girl and man. One living in Australia and the other in America. The two characters form a penpal-ship that takes them through both personal growth and development, making it quite heartwarming.

### 09**The Little Prince (2016)**

Categorizing this film as 'stop motion' one gave us pause because, technically, only half of the film was done in the stop motion style. However, that doesn't detract from the evident beauty in those scenes — which speaks not only of countless efforts but gives life to the exciting classic story of "The Little Prince."

### 10**Frankenweenie (2012)**

Another classic that you might recognize is "Frankenweenie" which was released in 2012\. It starts off quite grim, with a young boy bringing a dead dog back into life — only further adding to the goth aesthetic that the style of the characters is rocking.

## Part 4 **How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie**

For the last part of this article, we move on to the promised 'tutorial'. It won't be all that comprehensive, but it should give you a better idea of how **stop motion movies** are created and the kind of effort and hours that are put into it. Perhaps it will inspire you to try your hand at the process yourself.

### 01**Step 1\. Get a Camera.**

The first and most important part of setting up for a stop **motion movie** is to prepare your camera. As any little bit of jostling can cause a whole scene to look jarring, you'll need to make sure that this is taken care of. Otherwise, you might be forced to redo a scene unnecessarily.

In this case, the invention of tripods turned out to be a major boon, as it kept the camera at the correct vantage view.

### 02**Step 2\. Prepare Materials for the Set.**

Of course, as props and materials are important for bringing characters to life in a stop motion film, you'll need some pre-prepared in order to start.

This can be Lego action figures (if you're working on a **Lego stop motion movie**) or it can be a regular model or doll (if you're working on a 3D animation **stop motion animation movie**.)

![Prepare Props and Materials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss2.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Prepare the Set.**

For stop motion, it's important that both the scene and the camera are kept in stable positions. After all, the background will be captured too.

And, to allow for that illusion of motion, it's best if a still object is compared to one in motion. So, pay very careful when setting up your recording studio. It can make or break your project.

![Set Up Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-stunning-stop-motion-movies-that-you-should-not-miss3.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Editing Software**

For the last step, you'll need to pick out an editing software that you can use in order to put together your still images and create a video.

For that, we recommend the professional **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

02 [Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder](#Part 2)

03 [Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films](#Part 3)

04 [How to Make a Stop Motion Animation Movie](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What Movies Use Stop Motion Animation?**

First, that overview we promised. This will be a brief introduction to introduce certain key knowledge that you might not already know. Of course, for those who want to head straight to the recommendations, they can do so by skipping to of this article.

### 01**What is a Stop Motion Movie?**

The best way to introduce the concept of **stop motion animation movies** is to first reiterate that it is, literally, the oldest form of animation in film. This was what all the animators did before they figured out how to create the software required to make their characters come alive in a different way.

It involves a lot of crafting, a lot of maneuvering, a lot of careful and precise adjustments. To put it in the simplest way possible, it's the process of taking a still image of a scene. And then introducing 'motion' by changing the elements of said scene, little by little, and taking a picture at every opportunity in between. So that all the still images come together to create the illusion of movement and motion.

### 02**What is the Most Successful Stop Motion Movie?**

There are plenty of answers that could be given in this case. Perhaps it should be the first-ever **stop motion movie** to be made? Which was "The Humpty Dumpty Circus" created by Blackton and Smith with their own daughter's dolls.

You might also consider success by way of long-term watch ability. If so, then old classics like the "Nightmare Before Christmas" or "Rudolph the Reindeer." And finally. You have "Chicken Run" which is considered the best performing **stop motion movie** of all time. Having earned somewhere around $17.5 million in its first, weekend showing.

## Part 2 **Popular Stop Motion Movies You Might Wonder**

Now, how about some of the more popular stop motion practices to come out in the last couple of decades? Different from the **stop motion movies** of old but still the same at heart. What do we have to say about them?

### 01**Lego Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Well… Since our thoughts on the subject are distinctive, we thought to break it up. First starting with **Lego Movie stop motion** animation. This **stop motion movie** animation style, also called 'Brickfilms', is the practice of using Lego to create **stop motion animation movies**. It's been around since the 1970s, but it was only 2003 that the first official film was released by Lego, who partnered up with a production company to create films for them.

It ended up being one of the best choices for them. Especially in terms of marketing their toy products, and the practice had only grown in popularity since, with both kids and adults alike finding joy in the end product.

### 02**3D Stop Motion Animation Movies**

Alright, so how about 3D **stop motion movies**? How is it different from 3D animation movies and regular stop motion movies??? Well, it's actually a bit of a tricky term. The 3D in this case is to differentiate it from regular 2D stop motion animation as you see in a lot of animated films from the East (where each image is hand-drawn to show motion).

In this case, props, objects, character models, and other materials are used in order to sculpt a 3D model of a scene, and pictures are taken to capture motion. The first of the movies of this style is called "Tune with Tomorrow" but you might be more familiar with the title "Coraline."

## Part 3 **Top 10 Stop Motion Animation Films**

Now for our list of the best **stop motion animation movies** of our time. This will be somewhat subjective, but also not. Every single one of the **stop motion movies** on this list is highly rated everywhere and has received rave reviews — making it worth taking the time to watch every single one of them when you have the time.

### 01**Coraline (2009)**

We mentioned this **stop motion movie** previously, but in case you haven't already watched it, it's a classic. The storytelling elements of "Coraline" really matched the stop motion style of animation. It was released in 2009 as a 3D movie and it shares the story of a little girl that finds joy and excitement in an alternate reality. Only to realize that it wasn't all that it was chalked up to be.

### 02**The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)**

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is another **stop motion animation movie** that you might have already heard of before. It features the memorable character, Jack Skellington (the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown.) You can usually catch this film airing somewhere on television during the holiday season, as the story is all about Jack Skellington's obsession with ruining Christmas.

### 03**Chicken Run (1994)**

This next **stop motion movie**, called "Chicken Run" (1994) was also mentioned before. It is, as was previously discussed, the highest performing **stop motion animation movie** on the big screen.

Drawings will always have a special place in storytelling. Whether you are demonstrating a new concept to a child, highlighting the features of a product to your bosses, or showcasing the intricacies of a marketing campaign, drawings make it easier for the audience to understand what is being said.

That is why it is so important to learn how to **create whiteboard animation**. When you learn how to create a whiteboard video with **[animate pictures app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, you are in a unique position when it comes to selling your story, and convincing others of what you already know.

* [**Part1: What is Whiteboard Animation Video?**](#part1)
* [**Part2: How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation**](#part3)

## Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?

To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.

Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using [2D animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.

When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.

To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.

## Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?

#### Step 1: Write a Script

Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.

It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/write-a-script.JPG)

#### Step 2: Start with the Storyboard

Now you have a script. You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.

When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.

#### Step 3: Create Images

If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.

![create image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-image.JPG)

#### Step 4: Animate Those Images

Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.

![animate drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-drawing.JPG)

#### Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio

The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.

## Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation

#### Evoke Empathy

The goal of a whiteboard animation video is not just to explain information in a cold and impersonal way. You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.

By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.

#### Personalize the Images

Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.

## Conclusion

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 We all love GIFs and their impressive style of delivering stories. They not only contain set of frames rather they wrap inside lots of emotions and thoughts of creators. You can easily find numbers of eye catching GIF collections over social media sites.

 If you love these animated images then probably you might have initiated a search over internet about how to create GIFs. And search engine must have shown you a path to unlimited [GIF creator tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). That's common. But here we are going to talk about one professional recommendation for GIF creation. Yeah, it is Photoshop and it can instantly generate appealing animated Gifs for you.

 Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:

## How to make a GIF in Photoshop

* [Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop](#part1)
* [Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop](#part2)

### Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop

#### Step 1: Launch your software

 Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.

#### Step 2: Get your video clip imported

 As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.

#### Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings

 You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.

 It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:

**Colors:** Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.

**Dither:** The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.

**Lossy:** If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.

**Size:** Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.

#### Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file

 When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose "Save for Web" option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.

### Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop

 It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop's animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:

#### 1\.  Step 1

 First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts. It will provide you an option for Load Files into Stack. Now hit browse button and choose your images from desktop folder that you further want to use for development of GIF image. Hit OK. It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.

 Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.

 All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File > New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.

 Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have "Load Files into Stack" feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.

#### 2\.  Step 2

 Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.

 As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose "Make Frames from Layer" option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.

#### 3\.  Step 3

 Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.

 When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose "Save for Web" option.

### Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop

 It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop's animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:

#### 1\.  Step 1

 First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts. It will provide you an option for Load Files into Stack. Now hit browse button and choose your images from desktop folder that you further want to use for development of GIF image. Hit OK. It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.

 Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.

 All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File > New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.

 Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have "Load Files into Stack" feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.

#### 2\.  Step 2

 Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.

 As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose "Make Frames from Layer" option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.

#### 3\.  Step 3

 Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.

 We all love GIFs and their impressive style of delivering stories. They not only contain set of frames rather they wrap inside lots of emotions and thoughts of creators. You can easily find numbers of eye catching GIF collections over social media sites.

 If you love these animated images then probably you might have initiated a search over internet about how to create GIFs. And search engine must have shown you a path to unlimited [GIF creator tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). That's common. But here we are going to talk about one professional recommendation for GIF creation. Yeah, it is Photoshop and it can instantly generate appealing animated Gifs for you.

 Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:

## How to make a GIF in Photoshop

* [Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop](#part1)
* [Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop](#part2)

### Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop

#### Step 1: Launch your software

 Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.

#### Step 2: Get your video clip imported

 As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.

#### Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings

 You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.

 It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:

**Colors:** Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.

**Dither:** The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.

**Lossy:** If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.

**Size:** Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.

#### Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file

 When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose "Save for Web" option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.
