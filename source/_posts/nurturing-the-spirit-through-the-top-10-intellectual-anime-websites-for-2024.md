## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

While **importing 2D animations into Unity**, you can also configure its settings to ensure that it matches the overall game design. Ideally, we recommend keeping the Pixels Per Unit to the same size as all your visual components. This will allow you to maintain the desired consistency throughout the project and make it visually enticing.

Now, before proceeding any further, make sure to switch to the "Stripe Editor" window. With the "Stripe Editor", you'll be able to control the overall settings of each animation individually and control the movement to make it look crisper. In the Stripe window, you can also adjust the slice settings and save your work to avoid any potential data loss.

At this point, you can move towards creating the 2D animation with Unity. To do this, you'll have to bring both the Animation and the Animator tabs to UnityParts editing panel. You can make them visible by tapping the "Windows" option on your screen.

![animations in unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-2.jpg)

That's it; a timeline-based editing panel will appear on your screen. From here onwards, you can get started with animating the object. Each animation will depend on your specific game requirements. So, feel free to unleash your creativity and use different elements of Unity to bring your 2D animations to life.

## Part 1 The Difference Between A Video And A Gif

A GIF is a lot in use these days over social media platforms, and other online sites. Standing for Graphics Interchange Format, a GIF is basically a looping animation or a video that has a sequence of frames or images.

Though a lot of people can consider a GIF as a short video, there are a few key differences between the two. The first one lies in the name extension. A GIF file is saved as .gif while a video can be saved into several formats like .mp4, .mov, and more.

A video contains visual information having good quality frames as well as sound while a GIF is a short animation that uses some specific information created from a sequence of frames. Moreover, a GIF does not have a sound and the size is also very small.

![How to Animate Pictures in Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-pictures-in-canva-2.jpg)

#### Step 1: Add Static Elements

Start by creating an image through static elements. To make the design attractive, you can add sample texts, illustrations, doodles, and other entities.

Try to stimulate your creativity and come up with a layout beforehand. If possible, sketch on paper and replicate the same.

#### Step 2: Animate Your Design

Take a final glance at the layout. Make sure it's perfect. Once all the elements are placed as per your design, it's time to animate them. For that:

* Click on the white background page
* Go to the "Toolbar" section
* Select the "Animate" button

#### Step 3: Select Page Animation Style

Canva offers six animation styles, where five are for free users, and one is for pro users. To access the five animation styles, follow these steps.

* Select "Page Animations"
* There you will find options like Block, Pan, Fade, Rise, and Tumble
* Select the style as per your design

#### Step 4: Preview and Download

After selecting a page animation style, it will preview the effect. If you find it good, move on to downloading the GIF. Here's how to do so

* Go to the "Toolbar" option (present on your upper right hand)
* Choose GIF as the file type
* Check the page number and verify if it's correct
* Press the "Done" button

#### Step 5: Final GIF

After clicking on the "Done" button, your GIF will be downloaded. You will be able to see a display for five seconds. If you want to edit the image after this, click on the time button (near the "Animate" button).

So, that was all about how to animate a photo in Canva.
