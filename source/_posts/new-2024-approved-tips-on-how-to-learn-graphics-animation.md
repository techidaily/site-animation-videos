## Part 1 Why Study Graphic Design and Animation?

So, why should you care about graphic design and animation? The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.

However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why **graphics and animations** should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.

Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.

## Part 2 What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?

Now, whenever we talk about **graphic animation videos**, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.

### 01Motion Graphics

![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.

Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.

## Part 2 What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?

Now, whenever we talk about **graphic animation videos**, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.

### 01Motion Graphics

![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

![graphic design template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-2.jpg)

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

The best part about cartoons is that there's something for everyone. There are **iconic cartoon characters** that are humorous, cute, and cool.

Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

**Created:** 1941  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** William Hanna and various other voices

The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer's theatrical short films.

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

![charlie brown and snoopy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-6.jpg)

**Created:** 1950  
**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz  
**Voice:** Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

![Scooby doo and shaggy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-8.png)

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

![winnie the pooh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-9.jpg)

**Created:** 1926  
**Creators:** A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard  
**Voice:** Sterling Holloway. Hal Smith. Jim Cummings

The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.

Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children's books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie's friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.

### 10Pinky & the Brain

![pinky and the brain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-10.jpg)

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![powerpuff girls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-11.jpg)

**Created:** 1998  
**Creator:** Craig McCracken  
**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** Cartoons give valuable lessons about life. People of all ages can benefit from these life lessons. While comics typically target children, this does not rule out the possibility that adults will like them. There is a slew of animated sitcoms aimed squarely at adults! This means that individuals of all ages can enjoy and love cartoons.

**●** Thus, we listed the **most iconic cartoon characters** that made your childhood more exciting. So, enjoy your choice of **iconic cartoon characters** and have fun.

**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

The best part about cartoons is that there's something for everyone. There are **iconic cartoon characters** that are humorous, cute, and cool.

Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

**Created:** 1941  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** William Hanna and various other voices

The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer's theatrical short films.

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

![charlie brown and snoopy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-6.jpg)

**Created:** 1950  
**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz  
**Voice:** Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

![Scooby doo and shaggy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-8.png)

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

![winnie the pooh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-9.jpg)

**Created:** 1926  
**Creators:** A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard  
**Voice:** Sterling Holloway. Hal Smith. Jim Cummings

### 10Pinky & the Brain

![pinky and the brain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-10.jpg)

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

Anime is an elaborate form of animation with its bright colors and vivid imagination. It is a modified version of animation as we know it in the West with a peculiar Japanese taste of art. Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.

Now, who is the **coolest anime character** in the history of anime, and what are **[10 popular cartoon characters that you won't want to miss](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the **best anime characters** in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.

## Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever

* [1\. Light Yagami (Death Note)](#part1)
* [2\. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)](#part2)
* [3\. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)](#part3)
* [4\. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)](#part4)
* [5\. Levi (Attack on Titan)](#part5)
* [6\. Saitama (One Punch Man)](#part6)
* [7\. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)](#part7)
* [8\. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)](#part8)
* [9\. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)](#part9)
* [10\. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)](#part10)

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

## Final Words

Every anime character brings its feel and looks to the fictional world. As the vivid and ornate form of art, anime presents a different view of the world and the human mind's capabilities in creating such an intense augmentation of unreal to animated life.

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

Anime is an elaborate form of animation with its bright colors and vivid imagination. It is a modified version of animation as we know it in the West with a peculiar Japanese taste of art. Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.

Now, who is the **coolest anime character** in the history of anime, and what are **[10 popular cartoon characters that you won't want to miss](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the **best anime characters** in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.

## Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever

* [1\. Light Yagami (Death Note)](#part1)
* [2\. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)](#part2)
* [3\. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)](#part3)
* [4\. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)](#part4)
* [5\. Levi (Attack on Titan)](#part5)
* [6\. Saitama (One Punch Man)](#part6)
* [7\. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)](#part7)
* [8\. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)](#part8)
* [9\. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)](#part9)
* [10\. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)](#part10)

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around.
