## Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?

In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating **animation 3D models**.

The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.

## Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?

Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.

### 01Modeling

The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.

### 02Layout and animation

The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.

### 03Rendering

The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.

After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.

04 [Top 5 3D Animation Software](#Part 4)

05 [Top Animation Tips and Tricks](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?

In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating **animation 3D models**.

The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.

![3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/a-beginners-guide-to-explain-what-3d-animation-is-02.jpg)

## Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?

Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.

### 01Modeling

The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.

### 02Layout and animation

The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.

### 03Rendering

The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.

After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.

## Part 1 What is GIF & What is animated PNG

The GIFs are animated images and the picture moves in a sequence in a cycle. The movement repeats without stopping. This type of picture is popular on the webpages and the built-in templates are available in the digital space for quick downloads. The single-frame GIFs take more time to download and displays exciting moves that trigger laughter with audiences. GIF takes the abbreviation of Graphics Interchange Format. It came into existence in the year 1980s and is widely used globally. GIFs are animated images in a basic format. It adopts the safe LZW algorithm that tracks the colors optimally.

![GIF-and-APNG ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/gif-and-apng.jpg)

The superior form of the motion picture is animated PNGs. It stands for Portable Network Graphics. This format supports indexed color, grayscale, and true color images. Additionally, the animated PNGs has advantages like alpha channels, cross-platform gamma corrections and two-dimensional interlacing. APNG came into existence in the year 1995 and is compatible with a few web browsers.

## Part 2 GIF vs animated PNG, which is better?

When compared to GIFs and APNG, APNG seems to be technically strong with a wide range of supporting features. The quality of the file of APNG is good as it displays 24-bit images and 8- bit transparency. The APNG images can be compressed to the smallest value thereby encouraging the ease of transfer between devices. APNG has access to many color combinations whereas GIFs can use up to 256 colors. The new web browser versions are compatible with APNGs and the older browsers play the GIFs precisely. To view the APNG files in the older browsers you require external plugins or extensions. The higher quality APNGs are mostly used by professionals when compared to GIFs. The portability in moving the animated images is simple with APNGs. The GIF files have a poor compression rate and it is difficult to transfer at the digital space.

## Part 3 Can PNG be animated like GIF?

You can animate the PNG files like GIF using reliable tools in the online space. There are unique programs to establish this process.
