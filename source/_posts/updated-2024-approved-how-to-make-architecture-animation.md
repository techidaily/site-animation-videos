**Architecture Animation** is the practice of creating a 3D Animation of a structure. A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating **3D Architectural Animation** that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.

02 [Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design](#Part 2)

03 [5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

![Making Changes to Architectural Plans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation8.png)

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

![Promote Your Services with Architectural Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation9.png)

## Part 3 **5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio**

If your goal is to eventually make a name for yourself in the world of **3D Animation Architecture,** then it's a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with some of the more popular 3D Animation Services and Studios (who provide the kind of service required to create **architectural animations** like that you see in **Studio Ghibli Architecture**)

### 01**VisEngine**

The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is "VisEngine." They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you're curious as to the look of their finished **architectural animations**, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out

### 02**Exodo Animation Studios**

"Exodo Animation Studios" is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They've had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI

### 03**Promoshin**

Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn't mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they've worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)

### 04**ZOA Studio**

ZOA Studio brings us back to **Architecture Animation** services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it's a great resource for those looking for inspiration)

### 05**Studio Aiko**

Again, this next studio, called "Studio Aiko" is usually better known for its regular 3D Animation work. However, that doesn't mean that their **architectural animations** are any lesser in quality They produce very high-quality work fit for any kind of media platform. Making it a fitting solution for many professional architects

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Architectural Animations are now a staple for real estate projects. What with architects and construction engineers alike preferring to work with designers who can hand over a detailed look of their vision from the onset.

**●** There are many other benefits to **3D Architectural Animation**, of course, amongst which is better communication between you, as the designer, and your partners and clients **Architecture Animation** breathes life into a vision that may have previously existed only in your mind, and it smooths misunderstandings and eases progress

**●** If you're looking to start a career in **3D Animation Architecture**, we recommend that you look into some of the more popular service providers and studios in your area YouTube is a good platform to start looking if you're unsure. There, you can find many finished **architectural animations** that can serve as inspiration for future projects

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

![Making Changes to Architectural Plans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation8.png)

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

![2d animaiton reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reference.JPG)

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

![animation tips simplicity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simplicity.JPG)

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

![2D draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/draw-animation.jpg)

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

![feedback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feedback.JPG)

## Part 2: 3D Animation Tips for Beginners

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

![focus your frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-your-frame.JPG)

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

![ criticism](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/criticism.JPG)

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

![3D animation tips model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/model.JPG)

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

You can learn animation on your own, but that's not the best way. We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Conclusion

By taking the above animation tips, you can create engaging, inspiring, and unforgettable animations that will captivate your audience. Why not get started following these animation tips right now?

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

## Part 2: 3D Animation Tips for Beginners

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

![focus your frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-your-frame.JPG)

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

![ criticism](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/criticism.JPG)

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

![3D animation tips model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/model.JPG)

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

![2d animaiton reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reference.JPG)

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

**Cartoon character drawing** is usually a vital aspect of any child's life who loves to watch cartoon series and can sometimes be someone's favorite thing in the world.

![how to draw cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-1.jpg)

A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child's life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.

However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing **cool cartoon drawings** that will match different audiences, both older and younger.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

![how to draw with colour 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-6.jpg)

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

**Cartoon character drawing** is usually a vital aspect of any child's life who loves to watch cartoon series and can sometimes be someone's favorite thing in the world.

![how to draw cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-1.jpg)

A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child's life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.

However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing **cool cartoon drawings** that will match different audiences, both older and younger.

Step 1:

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**Step 7:** Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

![how to draw with colour 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-6.jpg)

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

03 [Best 5 Clay for Stop Motion and Ways to Get Started](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone

So, now that you are familiar with the basic concept of **clay stop animation**, let’s understand how you can get started with claymation animations. Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.

When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your **stop motion claymation** doesn’t feel jerky at all.

After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.

Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the **stop motion animation claymation**. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.

## Part 2 How to Edit a Stop Motion Claymation Animation

At this point, you would have several hundred photographs and a script in mind to make your **stop motion claymation**. So, the next part would be to turn these raw images into an animation. To do this, you can use different types of video editing applications. However, we recommend using Wondershare **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** for the job.

It’s a full-scale cross-platform video editing tool that’s designed to help creators showcase their creativity by turning RAW images/clips into visually engaging videos.

You can simply bring all the images to the timeline and merge them together to make a stunning animation within a few minutes. The tool also comes with a dedicated audio editing panel where you can add the voiceover or background tracks to bring life to your **stop animation claymation**. If you have edited any videos in the past, you may already know that the audio is the backbone for any video, even if you are editing a **stop motion animation using clay**.

Here’s a quick recap of all the features that make Wondershare Filmora an ideal video editing software for **stop motion claymation animation**.

## Part 3 Best 5 Clay for Stop Motion and Ways to Get Started

In case you are getting serious about **stop motion claymations**, you would also want to understand which clays are best for such animations. To be honest, you can find dozens of clays in the market. But, not every clay is worth using in a claymation. Here are 5 of the best clays for stop motion animations you can use in your projects.

### 01Puppet Putty

Puppet Putty is one of the most popular clay brands that’s specifically marketed towards claymation fanatics. As compared to other available options, the Puppet Putty is comparatively softer, which means you can easily mold it into different shapes using your hands only. While the Puppet Putty works great by itself, you can also combine it with other types of clay to make your clay models more appealing.

### 02Van Aken

Van Aken is another popular clay brand that’s ideal for **claymation animations**. It’s one of the inexpensive clays and that’s the reason why many claymation fanatics use it to create clay models for their projects. One of the best features of the Van Aken clay is that it’s available in different colors, which means you can get creative with your models by mixing different color combinations. Some animators also mix Van Aken with Pupper Putty to make the characters look more stunning under the perfect lighting conditions.

### 03Sargent Art

Sargent Art is a brand that primarily designs clays for sculpting. However, you can also use it to create clay models for your claymations. Sargent Art’s clay has the perfect blend of Wax and Oil, which makes it quite easier for the animator to sculpt different models.

### 04Sculpey

Sculpey is a clay brand that designs polymer-based clays that are relatively better than the traditional ceramic mud clays. This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.

### 05Plastilina

Finally, Plastilina is also a great option for **stop motion claymation** models. You can use Plastilina to design parts of the model that need to look as natural as possible. For example, you can use Plastilina to create parts such as teeth, eyes, and tongue so that your animation characters don’t contain any distortions.

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.

When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your **stop motion claymation** doesn’t feel jerky at all.

After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.

Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the **stop motion animation claymation**. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

## Part 1 **How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow**

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**●** It would be the user's profile URL + feed/RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser's URL. That is your profile URL.

**●** For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser's URL bar.

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

Click Save and view your blog.

## Part 2 **How to Upload Multiple Photos to Pinterest**

If you want to display multiple photos of your product or share your brand story with pictures, then this is a feature you will grab. Pinterest allows you to display various products at a time. But first, you must also have a business account to do this.

When you upload multiple photos on Pinterest, they are known as carousel pins. This feature is a great advertising tool and will help you during **the Pinterest slideshow**.

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

![Log into your Pinterest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-4.jpg)

**Step 2: Add Title**

Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe's title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.

**Step 3: Select a Board**

The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.

In the following section of this article, let us keep our focus on learning about some of the most amazing tips and tricks to upgrade your Insta story slideshow to the next level:

**●** **A Compact Photo Album**

You can use the feature to create a collection of amazing videos as well and share it too with your friends on social media without the guilt of becoming a feed-hog.

Want a practical experience of using Instagram slideshows? See through the following tutorial to understand the exact creation process:

**Step 1: Choose the First Image**

Begin with selecting the first image for your slideshow, just as you would ideally do for a normal, single image Instagram feed and long press the same.

**Step 2: Confirming the Selection**

Navigate to the bottom right corner of your selected image to locate a button similar to a photo slideshow. Tap the button to see a ‘1’ inscribed in a blue circle appear on your chosen image.

**Step 3: Make Further Selections**

You can now proceed to select other images or videos for the slideshow, in a similar fashion as the first one. You are allowed to include a maximum of 10 media files within the slideshow.

**Step 4: Customize Your Creation**

Tap the ‘Next’ button when you have finished making the required selections. The editor interface will now open to let you customize the selected images with a series of effects and filters, both one at a time, as well as the entire set altogether. You can also work with modifying the order of appearance of the photos and videos if required.

**Step 5: The Final Touches**

Once you are done with the editing process, continue to follow the remaining steps, as you would do to create a normal Instagram post. You can include captions, locations and tag your peers on the platform.

**Step 6: Time to Share!**

Your Instagram slideshow is ready to be posted. Upload it either to your feed or story to receive a hoard of likes and comments!

**●** **Animated Text Overlays**

If your Instagram story slideshows are missing out on the visual spunk, try complimenting their images and videos with animated transitions and text overlays. Short and quick animations are the best ways to enhance a slideshow story with an eye catching effect. Applying a variety of text overlays would help to keep the audience curious about the next visual delight.

**●** **Prefer a Vertical Aspect Ratio**

While the landscape mode tends to ward off certain portions of the visual media from a slideshow being played across multiple sized screens, using the portrait mode with a vertical aspect ratio suits best to almost every screen size. Taking care of this fact will ensure that your audience does not get distracted with the semi visible contents of the slideshow story.

**●** **Choose Your Editing Effects Wisely**

Regardless of the slideshow creation tool you prefer, there are a diversity of effects, templates, design elements and filters to uplift your craft with the perfect look. However, you should be cautious enough while making your choice so that the balance of colors, fonts and themes is affordably maintained, lest you would end up with a messy and loud Instagram story slideshow, that would not gather much appeal.
