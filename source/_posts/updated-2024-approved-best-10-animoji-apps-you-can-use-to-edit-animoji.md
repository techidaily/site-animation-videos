It's a very open subject.

### 01**GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads**

The best part of GIFs is that they are easily consumable media that you can share just about everywhere. For example, you can include them in your email marketing to bring a little life to what could have otherwise been a very dry message You can also have it play out on social media without prompting (different from videos, which the user usually has to play before it starts going.)

![Easy-to-Shared Ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/6-unexpected-ways-gif-animation-maker-can-affect-your-marketing6.gif)

### 02**GIFs Can Be Used for Promoting Events**

GIFs are also great for promoting events or holiday sales It's basically just a moving 2D advertisement (like the one that is shown below). Eye-catching in a way that keeps you looking to catch the movement — in compared to if you were just looking at a still image (which might catch your attention for a moment, but usually bores you the next)

![Animated Advertisements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/6-unexpected-ways-gif-animation-maker-can-affect-your-marketing7.gif)

### 03**GIFs Can Be Used for Call-to-Action Pop-Ups**

Perhaps you've seen this already in some YouTube videos (see the GIF attached for an example), but a lot of content creators now include GIFs on their content to prompt their audience to complete an action — be it subscribing, sharing, downloading a link, buying a product, etc. It's a great way of getting a message across in a way that is both fun and straightforward

### 04**GIFs Can Be Used to Set the Scene and Express Emotion**

GIFs are also a great way to just generally set the scene or express emotion. Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving' pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.

### 05**GIFs Can Be Used to Tell a Story**

You know the saying, "A picture can speak a thousand words?" Well, it's true, but in comparison to GIFs??? Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example. With just one look, you can probably create an entire story in your head about the woman that is featured This can be very useful for future marketing prospects.

![Tell a Story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/6-unexpected-ways-gif-animation-maker-can-affect-your-marketing10.gif)

### 06**GIFs Can Be Used to Explain or Share Instructions**

In the same way that you can create long infographics to offer instructions or teach a lesson on a particular subject, GIFs can be used to educate your audience. Only, it's a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below
