Unlike banners and pamphlets, videos are relatively more engaging and make it easier for marketers to establish a connection with the viewers. Now, each brand has different preferences when it comes to choosing the right video marketing strategy.

While some brands opt for conventional video advertisements, others get a bit creative and introduce **graphics animation** to their videos to make them more captivating.

03 [5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Why Study Graphic Design and Animation?

So, why should you care about graphic design and animation? The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.

However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why **graphics and animations** should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.

Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.

## Part 2 What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?

Now, whenever we talk about **graphic animation videos**, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.

### 01Motion Graphics

![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why **graphics and animations** should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.

Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.

## Part 2 What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?

Now, whenever we talk about **graphic animation videos**, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.

### 01Motion Graphics

![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

When it comes to animation, Adobe is recognized as one of the best tools. Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:

**●** Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.

**●** Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.

**●** Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.

**●** Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called "Repousse". By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space

**●** Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.

## Part 3 How to Create 3D Animations from a Single Still Image?

### 01Simple steps to create 3d animations from a single still image

When it comes to animation, Adobe is recognized as one of the best tools. Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:

**●** Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.

**●** Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.

**●** Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.

**●** Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called "Repousse". By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space

**●** Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.

The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.

The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.
