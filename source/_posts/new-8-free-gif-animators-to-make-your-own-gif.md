With present-day technology, **3D animation** has reached all spheres be it entertainment, advertising, architecture, education, and much more. With the increasing use of 3D animation, there is a rise in the tools and programs used for creating such animations.

So, to help you get all the details about 3D animation, **3D modelling and animation process**, best tools, tips, and tricks, keep reading the following parts.

01 [What Does 3D Animation Mean?](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Process of 3D Animation?](#Part 2)

03 [Types of 3D Animations](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 3D Animation Software](#Part 4)

05 [Top Animation Tips and Tricks](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?

In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating **animation 3D models**.

The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.

## Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?

Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.

### 01Modeling

The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.

### 02Layout and animation

The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.

### 03Rendering

The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.

After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.

![Process Of 3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/a-beginners-guide-to-explain-what-3d-animation-is-03.jpg)

## Part 5 Top Animation Tips And Tricks

Though 3D animation requires a lot of technical know-how of the process, there are several tips and tricks that can make your task quicker, easier, and smoother. We have gathered a few such tips below.

### 01Make realistic objects by observing real life

The more you will observe real-life the more you will be able to imitate it into your animations for giving life to your objects, models, and characters. Having some knowledge about real-life, gravity, and similar topics will help you work on your animations more interactively.

### 02Evolve with latest techniques and technology

The tools, programs, and technology are progressing every day and to make the best use of the same, you need to evolve with the technology. To use the features and functions of the software you need to keep learning and growing.

### 03Go with the basic first

While working with the animations, it is very easy to get carried away with the process and get into the trap of looking for details. This will eventually move you away from your main track and will lead to a waste of time and effort. Thus, it is always advisable to go with the basics first and then move towards the detailing.

### 04Learn about the human emotions

Facial expressions are an important element of any 3D animation that brings life to characters. A good animation will portray good and complex emotions and thus it is important to study these emotions in detail so that they can be incorporated into your objects, models, and characters.

With present-day technology, **3D animation** has reached all spheres be it entertainment, advertising, architecture, education, and much more. With the increasing use of 3D animation, there is a rise in the tools and programs used for creating such animations.

So, to help you get all the details about 3D animation, **3D modelling and animation process**, best tools, tips, and tricks, keep reading the following parts.

#### In this article

03 [Types of 3D Animations](#Part 3)

04 [Top 5 3D Animation Software](#Part 4)

05 [Top Animation Tips and Tricks](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What does 3D animation mean?

In simplest terms, animation is a process of manipulating the images so that they appear to be moving, and when this manipulation is done in three-dimensional space, it is called 3D animation. The objects and the models used for 3D animation can be rotated or moved like the real ones. Some tools can be used to scan real-life objects which can be then used as blueprints for creating **animation 3D models**.

The characters and the objects in 3D animations have to be moved to make them as realistic as possible. No matter, how interesting or perfect character you may create, if it does not move in an even manner, the overall effect will be ruined. The latest techniques and tools these days are capable of creating lifelike scenes.

## Part 2 What is the process of 3D Animation?

Creating a 3D animation is a complex process involving several phases. Below listed are the main 3 phases for creating an animation.

### 01Modeling

The main thing for any 3D animation is its objects, models, or characters and this phase involves creating these objects. Since the objects are based on 3D computer models, the process is termed 3D modeling. A model by a computer appears like a mesh of geometric shapes including curves, points, lines, and more. These shapes do not look anywhere like real objects and only after when the textures and colors are added to them, they appear like real things.

### 02Layout and animation

The next step is layout and animation where characters are placed in the scenes and the animation of their movements is done using 3D animation tools. Initially, keyframes are created which are the start and the end pose of any animation, and then later other details like the effects, lighting, camerawork, and more are added to get the desired animation that appears on the screen.

### 03Rendering

The final step in the 3D creation process is rendering where the created animation is finalized as well as exported. To make sure that the final animation plays seamlessly and looks absolutely perfect, it is essential to check all the minute details.

After the production of 3D animation is done, next comes the post-production which is the phase where effects, music, and voiceovers are added and combined to make the entire animation look complete.

### 02**PicMonkey**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.4/5**\]**

When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.
