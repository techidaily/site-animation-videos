02 [Top 3 Resources to Get Free Animated GIF Icons](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

02 [Top 3 Resources to Get Free Animated GIF Icons](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

![photoshop export gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-9.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Combine/Merge Animated GIFs Into One

### Method 1: Merge GIFs into one with Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is one of the top-rated photo editing software tools and nowadays it is popularly being used for GIF combining. Using Photoshop, you can easily play multiple GIF images side by side on the screen. Here are a few simple to follow steps to accomplish this task:

**Step 1:** Import GIFs to combine

First of all, users need to launch Adobe Photoshop on their device and then import both GIF images to individual tabs. This task can be easily done using Drag and Drop tools. Resize both tabs so that you can view both images at a time on screen.

**Step 2:** Save GIF with name

Go to the Window menu and ensure that the Timeline option is marked in the drop-down menu.

![GIF combiner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoshop-timeline.jpg)

Now open one empty file with height same as that of already imported GIF files. Save this file with any suitable name, for example Z.

![GIF combiner file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-an-empty-file.jpg)

**Note:** If you need a transparent view of your imported GIF images then go to Layer and select New and finally hit Layer option. You can now hide its bottom layer.

**Step 3:** Copy frames

It is time to move to GIF Z file, move to its timeline toolbar, and then select the menu icon from the top right corner of your screen. Paste your recently copied selection over here. Never forget to choose Paste Over selection option from Pop up Dialogue Box.

**Step 5:** Copy and paste

Simply repeat the process explained in Step 3 and 4 for the 2nd GIF image. After execution of these steps, your GIF Z file will be containing all layers of your imported GIF files but as you have pasted them one over another so it is important to separate their elements now.

**Step 6:** To make separation

To do this separation, go to GIF Z tab and then select layers of second GIF file and simply move them below the first GIF layer files. Users can now have a preview of both GIFs in the timeline window.

We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites.

### 02**PicMonkey**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.4/5**\]**

When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly.

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Creative Bloq: 4/5\]

The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an **online photo animator** and an application that you can download and install on your phone.
