The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.

Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.

## Part 1 How to Convert Video to GIF in Photoshop - Easy Way

If you want to **convert video to GIF** in Photoshop, here is a discussion of the easy way to go about it.

**Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right**

When you start to convert **mp4 to GIF using Photoshop**, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.

The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.

Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.

**Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop**

Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.

The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The "From Beginning to End" is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select "Selected Range Only." On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.

Last but not least, check the "Make Frame Animation" checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames.

The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.
