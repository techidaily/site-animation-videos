## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

![photoshop export gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-9.jpg)

### Method 2: Make Stunning Animated GIF Icons with Wondershare Filmora

Since Adobe Photoshop can be quite complicated to use, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora to create all kinds of animated GIF icons. It is a user-friendly media editing application that has a wide range of readily available assets and would also let you import files from your system.

Besides that, there are tons of stickers, visual elements, captions, animations, transitions, and so on that would let you create and customize funny GIF icons. Therefore, if you want to create animated GIF icons using Filmora, then you can simply follow these steps:

##### Step 1 Load Media Files (Images and Videos) on Filmora

## Part 1 Smart Ways to Create Your Own Animated GIF Icons

While there are so many ways to come up with animated GIF icons, I would recommend exploring the following options:

### Method 1: Use Adobe Photoshop to Create GIF Icons

If you are looking for a professional solution to create a live GIF icon, then I would recommend using Adobe Photoshop. While the application is not that easy to use, it will be an ideal long-term solution. In nutshell, you can create animated GIF icons by loading assets, duplicating layers, and then merging them in the following way:

##### Step 1 Load Assets on Photoshop

At first, you can simply launch Adobe Photoshop on your system and go to its File > Scripts to load media assets into your stack.

![photoshop load script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-2.jpg)

This will let you browse and load the media assets to your projects. In case you don’t have a layer created, then you can just go to its File > Layer and create a new layer.

![photoshop add layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-3.jpg)

You can now rename your layers and can go to its File > Window > Timeline to get a timeline view of the added assets.

![photoshop view timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-4.jpg)

##### Step 2 Work on the Video Timeline to Create a GIF

Great! Once you have got the timeline view on the application, you can click on its dropdown menu and choose to create a frame animation.

![photoshop create frame animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-5.jpg)

Afterward, you can select the added media and go to its Properties menu on the sidebar. From here, you can choose to create a new layer for each frame and then make frames from each layer.

![photoshop make frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-6.jpg)

This will create multiple frames on the timeline at the bottom. You can edit each frame on the timeline and can also set up its preferred duration.

![photoshop adjust duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-7.jpg)

You can also right-click the frames and select how many times your loading icon GIF would be repeated.

![photoshop video repeat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-8.jpg)

##### Step 3 Preview and Export your GIF from Photoshop

Lastly, you can get a preview of your animated GIF icons and can go to its File > Export and choose to save it for the web in a compatible (GIF) format.

![photoshop export gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-gif-icons-9.jpg)

### Method 2: Make Stunning Animated GIF Icons with Wondershare Filmora

Since Adobe Photoshop can be quite complicated to use, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora to create all kinds of animated GIF icons. It is a user-friendly media editing application that has a wide range of readily available assets and would also let you import files from your system.

Besides that, there are tons of stickers, visual elements, captions, animations, transitions, and so on that would let you create and customize funny GIF icons. Therefore, if you want to create animated GIF icons using Filmora, then you can simply follow these steps:

To get things started, you can just launch Wondershare Filmora on your system and go to its File > Import menu to load media files to it. You can also drag and drop your media files directly to the interface of Filmora.

![ filmora load media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 Create or Edit GIFs on Wondershare Filmora

After loading your images or video clips, you can drag and drop them to the timeline at the bottom. In case you can want to get rid of any video clip, you can just hover the mouse around and use its trimming tool to meet your requirements.

![filmora trim gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/trim-sides.gif)

Once you have edited your videos or images, you can just go to their properties from the sidebar. From here, you can scale, reposition, rotate, flip, and perform other edits on your media files.

![filmora rotate image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/rotate-image-filmorax.jpg)

##### Step 1 Select a Template of your Choice on Canvas

## Part 1 **Should You Study 3D Animation?**

![learning 3d animation 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginners-guide-for-learning-3d-animation-02.jpg)

3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with **3D animation courses online for free** to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.

As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:

**●** Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.

**●** 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.

**●** 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.

You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:

**●** **Modeling:** The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to **learn 3D animation and graphic design courses**.

**●** **Modeling:** The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to **learn 3D animation and graphic design courses**.
