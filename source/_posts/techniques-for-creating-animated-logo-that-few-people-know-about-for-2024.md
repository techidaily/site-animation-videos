**Step 3: Let’s Get Editing!**

When you have made your choice, navigate to the toolbar at the bottom of the app screen and click on the ‘Effects’ tab. Make a side scroll to choose a specific effect category, like that of ‘Artistic’ or ‘Magic’ to open a library of effects in the selected category.

As an example, selecting the ‘Cartoonizer’ option in the ‘Artistic’ effects category can add an immediate caricature feel to your selected real-time image. You can further include manual adjustments to get the perfect cartoon look by pressing and holding the ‘Cartoonizer’ option. There are a whole variety of magical effects, such as, Neo Pop, Soul, Badlands, Animation and Paw in the ‘Magic’ effects category, that are just perfect in giving your edit a fantasizing look with a Picsart cartoon background.

If you are looking for a quicker editing process, prefer adding cartoonized elements, like ‘Picsart Stickers’ to your image instead of going for a complete caricature edit. To do this, open the ‘Picsart Photo Editor’, navigates to the ‘Sticker’ symbol and click on it, followed by searching ‘Cartoon Sticker’. You can alternatively search a specific keyword with the ‘Cartoon’ descriptor, if you are clear on what you want to add.

You are free to take as many repetitions of the process as you wish, till you get the perfect result for saving to your device and sharing on your social media handles.
