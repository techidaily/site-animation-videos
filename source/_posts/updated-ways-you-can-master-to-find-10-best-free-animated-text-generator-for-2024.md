## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

![Aurora 3D Maker: Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator1.png)

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

![Xara 3D Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator7.png)

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

![TISFAT](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator10.png)

## Part 2 **8 Best Online Text GIF Generators to Make Animated Word GIFs**

And so, we move on to our next list! Here's where we introduce online solutions for animated text generation needs! So, all the tools on this list will not require any downloading, but they will require that you have internet while working!

### 01MotionDen

| PROS                                                                           | CONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

![MotionDen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator11.png)

### 02Wave.Video

**RATING:** 4.5/5

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

![Wave.Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator12.png)

### 03MakerMoon

| PROS                                                                                                                                                       | CONS                                                                                                                                                     |

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

![MakerMoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator13.png)

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

![Textanim](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator14.png)

### 05SnackThis

| PROS                                                                                                                                             | CONS                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

![SnackThis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator15.png)

### 06Animatron Studio

| PROS                                                                                                                    | CONS                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

![Animatron Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator16.png)

### 07Cool Text

| PROS                                                                        | CONS                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

![Cool Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator17.png)

### 08Loading.io

| PROS                                                                                                                                   | CONS                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

![Loading.io](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator18.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

## Part 2 **8 Best Online Text GIF Generators to Make Animated Word GIFs**

And so, we move on to our next list! Here's where we introduce online solutions for animated text generation needs! So, all the tools on this list will not require any downloading, but they will require that you have internet while working!

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

**RATING:** 4.5/5

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

![MakerMoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator13.png)

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

### 05SnackThis

| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

![Animatron Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator16.png)

### 07Cool Text

| PROS                                                                        | CONS                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

![Cool Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator17.png)

| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well).

### 08Easy Banner

**RATING:** 3.5/5

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |

| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

![Aurora 3D Maker: Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator1.png)

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

![Making Changes to Architectural Plans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation8.png)

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

## Part 3 **5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio**

If your goal is to eventually make a name for yourself in the world of **3D Animation Architecture,** then it's a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with some of the more popular 3D Animation Services and Studios (who provide the kind of service required to create **architectural animations** like that you see in **Studio Ghibli Architecture**)

### 01**VisEngine**

The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is "VisEngine." They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you're curious as to the look of their finished **architectural animations**, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out

### 02**Exodo Animation Studios**

"Exodo Animation Studios" is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They've had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI

### 03**Promoshin**

Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn't mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they've worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)

### 04**ZOA Studio**

ZOA Studio brings us back to **Architecture Animation** services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it's a great resource for those looking for inspiration)

### 05**Studio Aiko**

Again, this next studio, called "Studio Aiko" is usually better known for its regular 3D Animation work. However, that doesn't mean that their **architectural animations** are any lesser in quality They produce very high-quality work fit for any kind of media platform. Making it a fitting solution for many professional architects

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Architectural Animations are now a staple for real estate projects. What with architects and construction engineers alike preferring to work with designers who can hand over a detailed look of their vision from the onset.

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

## Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging

As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.

## Part 2 8 Tips for Character Rigging

### 01The Right Rig for the Job

Rigging is a skill all animators gets good at overtime. The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.

You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don't. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.

### 02Deformers for Facial Rigging

Constructing a realistic facial rig can be quite a task but is indeed satisfying once finished. Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

Though you can use one without the other, it is best to use both of them in an animation. You can't work without both arms can you? Applying both Inverse and Forward Kinematics in your rig design can help it make more stylistic.

### 04Learn Python and Maya API: Learn Python and Maya API

If you wish to take your rigging skills to the next level then learning Maya API and Python are great millstones. This way, you can create high quality and sophisticated rigs with high intense flexibility on Maya. Also, Python allows you to write new scripts for PlugIns.

### 05Delegate to an Animator

After rigging for several hours it is easy to feel like you are only seeing from one perspective. Get in touch with an animator earlier on in the project can help you get feedback to stay consistent in the rigging process.

### 06Learn Web Technologies: Learn Web Technologies

To be a good animator or rigging specialist involves a lot of learning. Animation technology is constantly changing therefore it is highly recommended to stay up to date with the latest web technologies. Learning HTML, Java Script and CSS is becoming vital to being a part of the gaming world.

### 07Use Scalable Tools

Not all the characters or objects you rig are going to be of the same size. Selecting the right rigging software is crucial for you to be able to scale your animations. You won't need to use everything, just the tools that serve your purpose.

### 08Use a Clean Interface

If you have ever heard of the phrase 'clean workplace – cleaner work' then you should know how an untidy interface can affect your workflow. This won't necessarily change the results but can surely better your experience.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

**●** What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.

**●** Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

**●** What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.

**●** Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.

The function of **character rigging** can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.

## Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging

As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.

## Part 2 8 Tips for Character Rigging

### 01The Right Rig for the Job

Rigging is a skill all animators gets good at overtime. The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.

You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don't. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.

### 02Deformers for Facial Rigging

Constructing a realistic facial rig can be quite a task but is indeed satisfying once finished. Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

Though you can use one without the other, it is best to use both of them in an animation. You can't work without both arms can you? Applying both Inverse and Forward Kinematics in your rig design can help it make more stylistic.

### 04Learn Python and Maya API: Learn Python and Maya API

If you wish to take your rigging skills to the next level then learning Maya API and Python are great millstones. This way, you can create high quality and sophisticated rigs with high intense flexibility on Maya. Also, Python allows you to write new scripts for PlugIns.

### 05Delegate to an Animator

After rigging for several hours it is easy to feel like you are only seeing from one perspective. Get in touch with an animator earlier on in the project can help you get feedback to stay consistent in the rigging process.

### 06Learn Web Technologies: Learn Web Technologies

To be a good animator or rigging specialist involves a lot of learning. Animation technology is constantly changing therefore it is highly recommended to stay up to date with the latest web technologies. Learning HTML, Java Script and CSS is becoming vital to being a part of the gaming world.

### 07Use Scalable Tools

Not all the characters or objects you rig are going to be of the same size. Selecting the right rigging software is crucial for you to be able to scale your animations. You won't need to use everything, just the tools that serve your purpose.

### 08Use a Clean Interface

If you have ever heard of the phrase 'clean workplace – cleaner work' then you should know how an untidy interface can affect your workflow. This won't necessarily change the results but can surely better your experience.
