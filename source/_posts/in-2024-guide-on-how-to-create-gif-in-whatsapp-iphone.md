Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

![2d animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3danimation-01.jpeg)

animations are like the ones Dreamworks, Pixar, produce. They include the avengers, the bad guys, etc.

Several 3D animation software exists in the market, both free and paid. If you are a **animation** creator or love animation for fun, you can use the free software to make your videos, **cartoon photos, 3d cartoon faces,** etc.

With many **animation** software available in the market, you can only fully trust a few.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

## 5 Different Animation Styles

Ready to enter into the world of animation along with us? We are all set to take you through a ride of different animation styles, their importance, and some of the videos that one should give a try!

#### 1\.  2D Animation

Let’s start with 2D as our fist animation style, which is the traditional or oldest form in practice for more than 100 years since 1908\. 2D has widely been in usage to create animated short films, cartoon characters, games, marketing videos, and educational materials. In 2D animation, the characters or items, creatures, and backgrounds get crafted in a two-dimensional space. It produces a graphic of movement with the drawings played serially one after another.

**Recommended Software**: At present, various free animator tools like Creatoon, Blender, and Pencil 2D, whereas, for professionals, Encore, Flash, Toon Boom Harmony, and Adobe Photoshop can be handy!

The above 2D animation style video is a short film “Dark Dark Woods” directed by the students at “The Animation Workshop.” It is all about the young princess, Maria, drenched, and tired of living a royal life being filled with rules, duties, lessons, responsibilities, and customs. One night, she enters into an adventurous event where she finds herself in a mysterious monster-filled dark wood. Watch the film and find did she find out there!

#### 2\.  3D Animation

As the next version of 2D, in the animation industry, 3D revolutionized the market since its first appearance in 1972\. Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.

**Recommended Software**: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.

Do you know how it feels if you are trapped alone on a deserted island? "It's a Cinch!" is a fantastic, funny 3D short film that is an adventurous movie made by the ESMA team at CGI. For sure, you will like this funny movie all about atrocities happening with a man and a pelican and enjoy it as much as I did!

#### 3\.  Motion Graphics

Our next animation style is motion graphics of the animated graphic design, where text appears to be the main enhancing factor. It is a piece of animation or digital footage that illuminates a motion or notation incorporated with audio. It is a new way of communicating to the audience and in driving them deep into the story. You can categorize it under the visual effect technique, which involves the movement of graphic images or elements like logos or text, sound, music, and motion. Motion graphics are best to be found in action and finds a place in multimedia projects, advertising agencies, branding, television title making, and storytelling.

**Recommended Software**: Tools that are best for motion graphics is Mocha AE, After Effects, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D.

The world is a great place, but we always forget another beautiful hidden green world behind the fantastic buildings we reside in. Yes, “Beautiful World” is a motion graphic video by Blasterjaxx & DBSTF feat. Ryder presents how we humans have developed a great empire by destroying the other beautiful part of the world.

#### 4\.  Stop Motion

Stop motion is one of the traditional animation styles that is the most popular filmmaking technique that uses hand-crafted or manipulated objects, mostly clay models. Puppets, silhouettes, and cut-outs can also be implemented as stop motion aids to produce animation. It is labor-intensive, a form of art, and has its flavor in animation, although 3D and visual effects have replaced it quite a long time before. But still, filmmakers like Tim Burton use stop motion in their films, making it to withstand the animation industry.

**Recommended Software**: You can make your stop motion video with software like Dragon frame, Stop Motion Pro Eclipse, and IKITMovie.

Although stop motion has gone before ages, there is still a fantastic introduction. Here is an award-winning short film, "Tokri (the basket)," which is a clumsy accident that leads a juvenile girl onto Mumbai's streets with the trust of making things correct. Studio Eeksaurus, an Indian bastion animation company, has depicted a father and daughter's tender emotive tale.

#### 5\.  Paint-On-Glass Animation

Here is a Paint-on-Glass animation style that is a technique used for making animated films that gives a lot of fun. Artists paint short stories on glasses using oil paints and film them by recording it frame-by-frame. Russian animator Aleksandr Petrov is a famous artist well known for making award-winning paint-on-glass animation. Animators use different objects like brick dust, sand, pastels, and charcoal, to create outstanding drama in their films.

**Recommended Software**: You can also become a paint-on-glass animator now with tools like Pencil 2D, Blender, Krita, and GIMP.

Suppose you are wondering whether you could find any paint-on-glass animated movie on social media sites. In that case, there are numerous animated films, like "The Old Man and the Sea," and "My Love," produced by the experts of pictures of Aleksandr Petrov animation. Surprisingly, this bind-blowing introduction is a result of oil paints on a sheet of glass.

### Conclusion

Do you aspire to become an animator and come up painting bright colors to videos? Choose animation styles that you most enjoy, find attractive today, and start working on it. Lastly, do not forget to give Filmora a chance to uplift your creation and give your animation style a life!
