## Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging

As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.

## Part 2 8 Tips for Character Rigging

### 01The Right Rig for the Job

Rigging is a skill all animators gets good at overtime. The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.

You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don't. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.

### 02Deformers for Facial Rigging

Constructing a realistic facial rig can be quite a task but is indeed satisfying once finished. Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

Though you can use one without the other, it is best to use both of them in an animation. You can't work without both arms can you? Applying both Inverse and Forward Kinematics in your rig design can help it make more stylistic.

### 04Learn Python and Maya API: Learn Python and Maya API

If you wish to take your rigging skills to the next level then learning Maya API and Python are great millstones. This way, you can create high quality and sophisticated rigs with high intense flexibility on Maya. Also, Python allows you to write new scripts for PlugIns.

### 05Delegate to an Animator

After rigging for several hours it is easy to feel like you are only seeing from one perspective. Get in touch with an animator earlier on in the project can help you get feedback to stay consistent in the rigging process.

### 06Learn Web Technologies: Learn Web Technologies

To be a good animator or rigging specialist involves a lot of learning. Animation technology is constantly changing therefore it is highly recommended to stay up to date with the latest web technologies. Learning HTML, Java Script and CSS is becoming vital to being a part of the gaming world.

### 07Use Scalable Tools

Not all the characters or objects you rig are going to be of the same size. Selecting the right rigging software is crucial for you to be able to scale your animations. You won't need to use everything, just the tools that serve your purpose.

### 08Use a Clean Interface

If you have ever heard of the phrase 'clean workplace – cleaner work' then you should know how an untidy interface can affect your workflow. This won't necessarily change the results but can surely better your experience.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

**●** What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.

**●** Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.

## Part 2 8 Tips for Character Rigging

### 01The Right Rig for the Job

Rigging is a skill all animators gets good at overtime. The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.

You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don't. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.

### 02Deformers for Facial Rigging

Constructing a realistic facial rig can be quite a task but is indeed satisfying once finished. Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

Though you can use one without the other, it is best to use both of them in an animation. You can't work without both arms can you? Applying both Inverse and Forward Kinematics in your rig design can help it make more stylistic.

### 04Learn Python and Maya API: Learn Python and Maya API

If you wish to take your rigging skills to the next level then learning Maya API and Python are great millstones. This way, you can create high quality and sophisticated rigs with high intense flexibility on Maya. Also, Python allows you to write new scripts for PlugIns.

### 05Delegate to an Animator

After rigging for several hours it is easy to feel like you are only seeing from one perspective. Get in touch with an animator earlier on in the project can help you get feedback to stay consistent in the rigging process.

### 06Learn Web Technologies: Learn Web Technologies

To be a good animator or rigging specialist involves a lot of learning. Animation technology is constantly changing therefore it is highly recommended to stay up to date with the latest web technologies. Learning HTML, Java Script and CSS is becoming vital to being a part of the gaming world.

### 07Use Scalable Tools

Not all the characters or objects you rig are going to be of the same size. Selecting the right rigging software is crucial for you to be able to scale your animations. You won't need to use everything, just the tools that serve your purpose.

### 08Use a Clean Interface

If you have ever heard of the phrase 'clean workplace – cleaner work' then you should know how an untidy interface can affect your workflow. This won't necessarily change the results but can surely better your experience.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

**●** What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.

**●** Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.

The function of **character rigging** can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.

## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

![animation tips simplicity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simplicity.JPG)

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

![2D draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/draw-animation.jpg)

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

## Part 2: 3D Animation Tips for Beginners

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

![focus your frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-your-frame.JPG)

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

![ criticism](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/criticism.JPG)

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

![3D animation tips model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/model.JPG)

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

You can learn animation on your own, but that's not the best way. We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Conclusion

By taking the above animation tips, you can create engaging, inspiring, and unforgettable animations that will captivate your audience. Why not get started following these animation tips right now?

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

You can learn animation on your own, but that's not the best way. We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Conclusion

By taking the above animation tips, you can create engaging, inspiring, and unforgettable animations that will captivate your audience. Why not get started following these animation tips right now?
