Our list of the top 8 beats places to download **royalty-free GIFs**. You may get a lot of **GIF libraries free** by visiting these websites. These websites allow animated GIFs for various purposes, including personal, educational, and commercial ones. You can use the GIFs you download on your websites, blogs, presentations, and emails, among other things. The most excellent part about most of these websites is that you don't have to pay anything or give them credit in exchange for royalty-free GIFs.

There are numerous websites to download **royalty GIFs** with stock sound effects and photographs. However, when it comes to **copyright-free GIFs**, only a few websites offer them up for download. So, after spending a much time on the internet, I've found five websites that can assist you in doing the same.

02 [Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?](#Part 2)

03 [The Best 8 Places for High-Quality Royalty Free Gifs (Paid and Free)](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 2 **Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?**

All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not **copyright-free GIFs.** However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.

You may not copy, modify, publish, transmit, distribute, perform, or display any content for commercial purposes or in any way violate these Terms of Service. Except for content in the public domain or the content you have permission to use in connection with the use of the Services and compliance with these Terms of Service.

Copyright laws in the United States and around the world protect their Services. Giphy has the right (but not the obligation) to remove, block, edit, or alter any content any time, without any notice, for any reason or no reason at all. Giphy, however, reserves the right to access, read, store, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is required to comply with applicable laws or protect our, our users' and the public's rights, property, or safety.

03 [The Best 8 Places for High-Quality Royalty Free Gifs (Paid and Free)](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)
