Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.

It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.

## Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva

There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.

The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.

Think of the text font you’re going to use.

![Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png)

Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.

![Animated elements Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png)

You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.

![Adding pictures to Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png)

Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.

### 2.1 Image

To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.

For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don't. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.

The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.

The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.

### 2.2 Text

Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.

### 2.3 Video

If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.

Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.

With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.

On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.

![Canva playback animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-6.png)

If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.

You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”

### How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?

The brilliant thing about Canva is that you can decide the order you want to create your animation. The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.

You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.

### How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva

Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.

If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.

## Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video

If you’ve decided Canva is not the tool for you, you can choose any video editing software to make your animation.

Wondershare Filmora is the tool that can help you level up your content creation. It allows users to increase precision and provides professional video editing options.

## Part 1 Benefits of Using Video Downloader Online

Today's information technology centered era has found a web solution for almost any and everything that can be possibly thought of. From informative articles to explanatory videos, you can find useful and need specific content in a diversity of ways. While reading does not sound a convenient cup of tea to most of us, videos are something more preferable.

When looking through descriptive solutions that could affordably serve your purpose, explanatory videos are the handiest choices owing to the 'see and learn' flexibility they provide viewers with. However, what attract more concern is, how to save these videos to your device. After all, you would never want to lose a useful video and most of us, of course have data pricing and usage limitations.

Online video downloader tools are certainly the most widely preferred and trusted solutions to the aforesaid concerns, and why not, they claim a range of choice benefits. Some of the obvious benefits of using these tools are listed below:

### 01Hassle Free Video Streaming

A seamless stream is something all of us would wish to be guaranteed of, before even thinking to watch a video. Whether looking through informative content or just as an entertainment choice, videos with frequent buffering intervals are always disapproving. One of the major reasons you should prefer an online video download is to escape the 'and…that's buffering again' notch.

### 02Information Sharing

Living within a bunch of social media platforms and utilities, content sharing has become more of a habit than a requisite need. Any and everything ranging from useful to entertaining, unusual to funny; is shared across social media platforms every seconds.

Well, that's absolutely fine, but what if you wish to share large video files through Instant Messaging tools and mails? Link sharing is not always convenient, owing to device version differences. To be on the safe side, it is quite better to download videos online and share them with your peers without having to worry about length and device compatibility.

### 03Cut Down on e-Learning Utilities

Imagine a scenario where you are into watching an explicitly useful video and the internet shuts down or you run out of data? This can be both annoying and critical at times. Why take the risk when you have dependable solutions? Just go for a quick video download using any of your preferred online tools and enjoy an uninterrupted streaming

### 04YouTube is not the End

Online video downloading tools provide you with the flexibility of surfing through a pool of content sites and support a range of video formats.
