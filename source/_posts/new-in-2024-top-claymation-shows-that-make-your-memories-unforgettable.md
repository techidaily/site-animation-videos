## Part 4 **Tips for Enhancing Your Insta Story Slideshow**

By far, you have come a long way reading through the credibility, usage and tools to create **Instagram story slideshow free** of cost as well as though paid subscriptions. In the following section of this article, let us keep our focus on learning about some of the most amazing tips and tricks to upgrade your Insta story slideshow to the next level:

**●** **A Compact Photo Album**

Do you land among those social media freaks how want to share just every moment of your day with your peers, or are you confused on selecting the best photos and videos of a cherished event, vacation or bringing home a new utility and end up posting a heap of media on your social media handles?

If your answer is a guilty ‘Yes’, you can try on giving up the habit now by creating an **Instagram story photo slideshow** to share mini album of your most loved images from the event or vacation. You can use the feature to create a collection of amazing videos as well and share it too with your friends on social media without the guilt of becoming a feed-hog.

Want a practical experience of using Instagram slideshows? See through the following tutorial to understand the exact creation process:

**Step 1: Choose the First Image**

Begin with selecting the first image for your slideshow, just as you would ideally do for a normal, single image Instagram feed and long press the same.

**Step 2: Confirming the Selection**

Navigate to the bottom right corner of your selected image to locate a button similar to a photo slideshow. Tap the button to see a ‘1’ inscribed in a blue circle appear on your chosen image.

**Step 3: Make Further Selections**

You can now proceed to select other images or videos for the slideshow, in a similar fashion as the first one. You are allowed to include a maximum of 10 media files within the slideshow.

**Step 4: Customize Your Creation**

Tap the ‘Next’ button when you have finished making the required selections. The editor interface will now open to let you customize the selected images with a series of effects and filters, both one at a time, as well as the entire set altogether. You can also work with modifying the order of appearance of the photos and videos if required.

**Step 5: The Final Touches**

Once you are done with the editing process, continue to follow the remaining steps, as you would do to create a normal Instagram post. You can include captions, locations and tag your peers on the platform.

**Step 6: Time to Share!**

Your Instagram slideshow is ready to be posted. Upload it either to your feed or story to receive a hoard of likes and comments!

**●** **Animated Text Overlays**

If your Instagram story slideshows are missing out on the visual spunk, try complimenting their images and videos with animated transitions and text overlays. Short and quick animations are the best ways to enhance a slideshow story with an eye catching effect. Applying a variety of text overlays would help to keep the audience curious about the next visual delight.

**●** **Prefer a Vertical Aspect Ratio**

While the landscape mode tends to ward off certain portions of the visual media from a slideshow being played across multiple sized screens, using the portrait mode with a vertical aspect ratio suits best to almost every screen size. Taking care of this fact will ensure that your audience does not get distracted with the semi visible contents of the slideshow story.

**●** **Choose Your Editing Effects Wisely**

Regardless of the slideshow creation tool you prefer, there are a diversity of effects, templates, design elements and filters to uplift your craft with the perfect look. However, you should be cautious enough while making your choice so that the balance of colors, fonts and themes is affordably maintained, lest you would end up with a messy and loud Instagram story slideshow, that would not gather much appeal.

Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.

Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.

## Part 3 How to Use a Variety of Photoshop Special Effects to Create the Final Caricature Look

Considering the extensive discussion on the credibility of the Photoshop Image Editor application in the realm of creating stunning caricature images in high end resolution, let us proceed to learn about using the diversity of Photoshop’s special effects to get the last stage cartoonized appearance of ordinary still images.

**User’s Guide to Create High End Cartoonized Look**

The following tutorial is a stepwise explanation of the process to **convert photo into cartoon Photoshop** in the easiest possible way. Stick to the method for getting affordable results in a quick span.

**Step 1: Download and Launch the Program**

Visit the official website of Photoshop Image Editor for a free download of the software program in your system, followed by installing and launching the same in your device.

**Step 2: Upload Your Image**

On a successful launch of the editor program, you will be directed to the ‘Photoshop Editor’ window, where you are required to upload any desired still image from your device for creating a cartoonized edit. To do this, either simply add your image to the editor workspace using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method, or navigate to the ‘File’ tab in the top toolbar and click on ‘Open’ in the dropdown menu.

**Step 3: Edge Enhancement**

Once your image appears in the editor timeline, proceed to sharpen the edges of the face and body of the portrait. Start with navigating to and clicking on the ‘Filter’ option, followed by tapping on ‘Filter Gallery’ and selecting the ‘Artistic’ folder, where you need to choose the ‘Poster Edges’ option. Observe the effect of these setting on the portrait and make necessary changes.
