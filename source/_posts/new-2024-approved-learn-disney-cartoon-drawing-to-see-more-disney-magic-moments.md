### 02How to Draw Captain America

Follow these simple steps to make a Disney cartoon drawing of Captain America:

**Step 1**: Draw the head and chest

Draw the outlines of his masked face using smooth lines. Draw a curved line across his face to divide his face from his mask. Draw a large letter A and add tiny wings beside it on his forehead. Draw his mouth, eyes, and nose. Use curved lines to indicate his shoulder and chest, then draw a star on his chest.

![draw the head and chest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-12.jpg)

**Step 2**: Draw his arm and waist

Draw a curved line on the shoulder to represent the bicep, then draw his gloved arm curled to form a fist. Draw curved lines beneath the chest to represent his muscular weight, then draw the pouches on his belt and use more curved lines to draw his waist.

![sketch his waist and arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-13.jpg)

**Step 3**: Draw his legs

![draw his legs in boots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-14.jpg)

**Step 4**: Draw his shield

Against his right arm, carefully draw a flattened circular shape. You can achieve this by drawing concentric circles with a large star in the middle. Draw his arm poking out from behind his shield.

![draw a circle for its head](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-disney-cartoon-drawing-18.jpg)

PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

![Company Presentation PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques1.png)

### 02[**Move Animated PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/move-animated-powerpoint-template-AY6RG6D)

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

### 04[**UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)**](https://elements.envato.com/unigraph-animated-creative-template-pptx-8V8DBFR?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O220U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

![UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques4.png)

### 05[**Graph & Charts PowerPoint Presentation**](https://elements.envato.com/graph-charts-powerpoint-presentation-QU6MKBV?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2UIU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

![Graphs & Charts PowerPoint Presentation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques5.png)

This next PowerPoint template is most suited for businesses looking to promote their products. The creator of the template has provided five different colored versions of the template, each with 30 unique slides that were carefully sectioned with suitable animations.

![Laststyle - PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques6.png)

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

![Add Animation - Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques21.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

### 06[**Laststyle - PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/laststyle-powerpoint-template-2BGADZ7?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2X0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

This next PowerPoint template is most suited for businesses looking to promote their products. The creator of the template has provided five different colored versions of the template, each with 30 unique slides that were carefully sectioned with suitable animations.

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

![Add Animation - Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques21.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

![Company Presentation PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques1.png)

### 02[**Move Animated PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/move-animated-powerpoint-template-AY6RG6D)

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

![Move Animated PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques2.png)

### 03[**40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint**](https://elements.envato.com/40-animated-conceptual-slides-for-powerpoint-QAANXAP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3OxV0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

Again, we have another modern and minimalistic kind of PowerPoint template with ‘40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint.’ It comes with 40 modern slides, all of which come fully animated are easy enough to customize with your own branding or content.

![40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques3.png)

### 04[**UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)**](https://elements.envato.com/unigraph-animated-creative-template-pptx-8V8DBFR?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O220U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

![UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques4.png)

### 05[**Graph & Charts PowerPoint Presentation**](https://elements.envato.com/graph-charts-powerpoint-presentation-QU6MKBV?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2UIU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

![Graphs & Charts PowerPoint Presentation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques5.png)

### 06[**Laststyle - PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/laststyle-powerpoint-template-2BGADZ7?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2X0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

This next PowerPoint template is most suited for businesses looking to promote their products. The creator of the template has provided five different colored versions of the template, each with 30 unique slides that were carefully sectioned with suitable animations.

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

![Add Animation - Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques21.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

## Part 3 History of Motion Graphics

Previously, before the presence of motion graphics in the world of technology the graphics worked just the images in the un-moving and flat formats.

Motion graphics first came into the scene when Oskar Fischinger and Norman McLaren were doing some experimental work. Later in 195some designers introduced motion graphics to the public in a bigger way. The designers later used in a few films that time and these films are still a great example of the motion graphics used at that time. Motion graphics in these films presented information such as the product company, actors, film directors, movie title, and many other things about the films in a very creative way.

Playing with the words or graphic elements was never seen by the people before the motion graphics. Later it’s started used in mostly all films and ad videos.

Now a day in the few years the advancement of animation software’s and the improvements in designs allowed people to learn more about motion graphics and try to produce new and eye-catching graphics.

## Part 4 Uses of Motion Graphics Today

Now a day due to the new technology every day the presence of the screen in multiple devices has extended the usage of motion graphics. **Motion graphics** are generally used in every device that has a screen such as opening the TV, introducing the information with the bumpers, and many other things. Below are a few examples where motion graphics are mainly used:

### 01Branding

Branding is the biggest channel and branding owners were looking for something different to refresh their brand and make it different from the other SKY channels. The Nerdo Creative Studio used motion graphics in their channel video and created a beautiful video with typography and text effects. This video makes it different from the other channels which generally people don’t see every day on television.

![Creating Awareness about Something](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/what-is-motion-graphics-5.JPG)

## Part 5 Motion Graphics vs. Animation: What’s the Difference?

Motion graphics are generally represented with moving images, text, and other objects and these graphics can easily display information with the help of moving objects such as the moving website logo, blurring text, bars in graphs, etc. Simply we can say the motion graphics can display the letters and shapes in the motion of the user’s choice. Sometimes things are very hard to explain with the still images whereas with the help of a few seconds of motion graphics you can clear everything perfectly.

If we talk about animation then this is a term under which motion graphics falls. Animation is used for more than 1years. So, we can say motion graphics are a part of animation itself. Any technique in the world which helps users to move static images or objects is known as animation. It can be Claymation, anime, cartoons, or motion graphics.

Mainly the content separates the motion graphics from the other types of animations because, in the motion graphic text, objects are associated with the other graphic designs.
