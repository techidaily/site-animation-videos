## How to Make Creative Animation Videos

Animation can explain whatever the mind of man can conceive – Walt Disney. Animation video is a craft in which images go through the process of conspiring, layout addition, and photographic chronology to create an illusion of action. In this article, let's learn the importance of video animations and when and why to use this technique.

![create catchy animation video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-catchy-animation-video.jpg)

## What are Video Animation and its importance?

Video as a marketing tool has become more popular but also more important. In this article, you can read more about why media marketing is getting more essential in comparison to text marketing. Therefore, an explainer video with Animation is an amazing way to show your target audience who you are, where you stand for, what you do and how you can solve the customer's problem.

Video animation is an engaging technique that can help you comprehensively tell your story. Animated meaning can be better comprehended as a simulation of motion created by showing a series of pictures. Animated videos for a business catch the viewers and make for an enjoyable story-telling experience.

Often, animation videos are used to explain a concept or process. It's straightforward to make these videos appealing and likable as you can primarily create them however you want. It can take longer to get the point across when people explain how to do something. Animations not only trigger emotions but spark conversations as well.

## What are most common types of Animation?

The purpose of this article is to take you through the complexity of the different types of animation styles and methods. It also covers the track you should take (and what that path entails) to become an animator for each of the five types.

This guide is not about learning how to animate. But instead, it breaks down the five types of Animation available to you and what you'll need to start animating: best software, schools, and courses.

**Motion Graphics (Key framing)**: Motion graphics focus on making dynamic and exciting presentations of moving text logos and fundamental illustrations.

* Motion graphics can be 2D and 3D, and you'll find them everywhere in news, sporting videos, the news, and other TV productions.
* Correct character animation is generally outside the scope of motion graphics, but many core animation principles also apply to motion graphics.
* Creating Motion Graphics depends on the plan used since video editing software often have different user interface or settings, but the idea is the same. Motion Graphics usually involves animating texts, pictures, or video clips using keyframing that is tweened to make a smooth motion between frames.

![key frame animation filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/key-frame-animation-filmora.jpg)

**Traditional Animation**: This is the classic type of Animation you're probably most well known with. In the past, animators drew characters frame by frame, and then those pictures were moved onto transparent sheets for painting. That's where the term animation comes from.

They started scanning drawings into the computer for digital coloring. The important thing is that hand-drawn animators still create their animation frame by frame using the same method and concept as in those old days of paper and cels.

## How to Use Motion Graphics Animation in Filmora

Keyframes specify the start or end of a transition in a shot. A series of keyframes can give the semblance of the movement of an object. Keyframes include parameters such as Position, Scale, Opacity, and Rotation. These values can be changed and customized to make animations using keyframing.

01 [What Is GIF Illustration?](#Part 1)

02 [Best 12 Illusion Gifs](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?

GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.

Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.

These are now used as everything from advertisements to commentary from all walks of life. The users of GIFs seem to be endless! They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.

## Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs

This curated list will help you to know the best **Illusion GIF** that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-

### 01Van Gogh Stare GIF

The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the "dazzle camouflage," is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye's instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/9tXAXIgFsKyuotYjDh)

### 02This brain-busting rotation

We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can't see it from every angle.

### 03This loop tea GIF

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/meme-image-know-K79kKDx86GMik)

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE)

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj)

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik)

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/brain-ca-optical-B45OfCUzIafQs)

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik)

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.

## Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs

This curated list will help you to know the best **Illusion GIF** that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-

### 01Van Gogh Stare GIF

The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the "dazzle camouflage," is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye's instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.

### 02This brain-busting rotation

We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can't see it from every angle.

### 03This loop tea GIF

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works.

## Part 1  5 Best Places to Find Animated Christmas GIFs for Free

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

![pinterest christmas gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-christmas-gif-2.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

If you are looking for funny Christmas GIFs, then Giphy would be one of the best places to explore. It has some of the most extensive GIFs collections of all styles, including Christmas wishes GIFs.

## Part 2 How to Create your Animated Christmas GIFs (with Music): A DIY Guide
