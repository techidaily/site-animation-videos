Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it's always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.

The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000\. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for.

"Where is everyone getting their **3D Text Animation** templates?"

To answer this request, we've compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like **3D Spinning Text (After Effects)** but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., **3D Text Animation** templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.

#### In this article

01 [Top 10 3D Text Animation Templates ](#Part 1)

02 [How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?](#Part 2)

03 [The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates](#Part 3)

04 [Secrets to Learning More Animation Tactics](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

![Add Graphic Elements to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates5.png)

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!

**●** You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.

**●** Of course, if you don't have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you're looking for.

**●** SECRET TIP! If you're looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It's a video editor, first and foremost, but that's not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!

"Where is everyone getting their **3D Text Animation** templates?"

To answer this request, we've compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like **3D Spinning Text (After Effects)** but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., **3D Text Animation** templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

![Add Graphic Elements to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates5.png)

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender.

Numerous effects to choose from

Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There's a surprisingly large amount of both **caricature photo maker** apps and **online caricature maker** tools.

Today, we'll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we've even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to **make a caricature of a photo**.

#### In this article

01 [The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects](#Part 1)

02 [How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/momentcam-cartoons-stickers/id687624831>

![MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330>

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743>

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voil%C3%A0-ai-artist-cartoon-photo/id1558421405>

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

![Caricature Hyper Face Morph Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cartoon-caricature-face-camera/id1424277519>

![Cartoon Caricature Face Camera Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects9.png)

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Caricature is now possible in an instant with the use of a **caricature maker** app. These tools render an existing photograph with the use of filters and effects to create a **caricature sketch** worthy of any artist's skill.

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.

We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There's a surprisingly large amount of both **caricature photo maker** apps and **online caricature maker** tools.

Today, we'll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we've even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to **make a caricature of a photo**.

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330>

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743>

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

![Caricature Hyper Face Morph Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743>

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

![Caricature Hyper Face Morph Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Caricature is now possible in an instant with the use of a **caricature maker** app. These tools render an existing photograph with the use of filters and effects to create a **caricature sketch** worthy of any artist's skill.

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.
