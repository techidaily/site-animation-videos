## Part 1 **Why GIF?**

Before we move on to the tutorials, let's do a brief account on GIF files We've also answered some of the more common questions regarding using a **GIF image maker** below for your edification

But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you're looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms

### 01**Why Gif from My Images Are Blurry?**

One of the biggest issues people tend to have when turning an **image into GIF** is that they come out of the process with a blurry end-product. No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you're using and your initial picture For the former, it's best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result.

This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome

For example, you can speed up the animation with the 'Speed' slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the 'Repeat' slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result

****Step 1: Import Images into an Image Stack**

First, starting on a new product, upload the images that you want to turn into a GIF into a photoshop 'Image Stack'. This can be done by clicking the 'File' tab and selecting the 'Scripts > Load Files into Stack…' option

Afterward, a pop-up window will appear where you will be prompted to browse your computer for the aforementioned images Click 'OK' when done

![Upload Images into Image Stack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif6.png)

![Loop Animation Forever](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif12.png)
