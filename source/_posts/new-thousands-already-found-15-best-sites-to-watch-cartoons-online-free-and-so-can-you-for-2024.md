Once done with the production stage, it is time to transition to post-production. Here, your stop motion animation will get its final posture. You need to place all the images you wish to include in the video's final cut into a folder and arrange them the same way as they should appear in the video. Even though **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** provides powerful video editing tools that enable you to improve the colors in the footage you are syncing with, it is best to edit your photos via dedicated photo editing software.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab. Moreover, you should also import all audio files you would like to use in your project before doing any actual editing. When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04\.

You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the **Play** button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04\.

You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the **Play** button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.

You need to place all the images you wish to include in the video's final cut into a folder and arrange them the same way as they should appear in the video. Even though **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** provides powerful video editing tools that enable you to improve the colors in the footage you are syncing with, it is best to edit your photos via dedicated photo editing software.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04\.

#### Method 1: Powerpoint Picture Insert Utility

 Select the Insert tab located at the top of the Powerpoint application.

![insert gif to powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insert-gif-to-ppt-1.jpg)

 The next step is to select the Picture icon located in the Images ribbon area located also at the top of the computer window. Look for the image that you desire to add to the Powerpoint slide, then make sure to double click on the file to successfully insert your image.

 You also have the option to move the GIF image on the page by clicking and dragging the image to the location that you want to place the picture.

#### Method 2: Copy and Paste

 A helpful step is to first locate your desired GIF image, using Control + C to copy it first. Then, paste your image on the Powerpoint slide by pressing Control + V.

 You can also highlight the file name, and then use the drag and drop feature to put your image directly into the Powerpoint slide of your choice.

#### Method 3: Embedding GIF's from the web

 The final method is to embed GIF images on the Internet into a Powerpoint slide. You can achieve this function by using the Insert Ribbon's Pictures icon.

 Select Pictures, then write in the image URL directly in the File input box. Then, select Insert. The Powerpoint application will download the GIF image that you selected into the current Powerpoint slide for your presentation. The GIF image is still available for you to access anytime if you are not connected to the Internet. It is due to being embedded.

 Here we recommend the method 1 and 2, the method 3 will take a little time while Powerpoint downloading the GIF picture.

## Customize the GIFs in Powerpoint

 There are some important ways to customize your GIF images in the Powerpoint application.

 If you desire on changing the physical size of your GIF file or changing the appearance of the image, you can right click on your desired image and select Format Pictures. It will open up a brand new Format Picture window that will have a good variety of image editing menus at your fingertips at the left side of the computer window.

 There is a feature where you can change the brightness and contrast on your images by selecting the Picture Corrections icon. Experiment and have fun.
