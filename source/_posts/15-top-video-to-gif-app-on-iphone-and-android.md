The function of **character rigging** can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.

02 [8 Tips for Character Rigging](#Part 2)

04 [How to Make 3d Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Intro to Character Rigging

As you already know by now that the process of rigging a character can be quite a tedious task. It involves a lot of creative thinking, precision and a keen eye to notice all the small details.

Once you have a model character to work on, riggers set off to creating a skeleton to match the character. These skele-animations can be used to move the entire model as if tugging on strings (not literally).

The movement of the chain of skeletons or rigs is interdependent. Which means if you pull on any one bone, it moves all the other bones in the same sequence. Similar to how bones move within the human body.

Riggers use programs and tools to create a series of bone like structures that can deformed and animated freely according to the preference of the animators.

Movements like positioning, curving and rotation can be recorded and then played back in the animation.

This requires the rigger to constantly coordinate between modelers, animators till the end of the project. This entire process can take weeks or even months.

Amazingly enough, its 20and there are online tools and tutorials you can use to easily learn complex animations like they make in large scale movies and games.

## Part 2 8 Tips for Character Rigging

### 01The Right Rig for the Job

Rigging is a skill all animators gets good at overtime. The more you practice the more familiar you are with the tools you are using. It will also help you understand that not all rigs are meant for the same set of movements.

You need to be able to discern what rig is it that you need and discard what you don't. If the rig is being used in a game, then the focus will be more on the experience while for movies its attention.

### 02Deformers for Facial Rigging

Constructing a realistic facial rig can be quite a task but is indeed satisfying once finished. Human facial features require a great degree of flexibility which is why using a variety of deformers for different parts of the face. They are better suited for creating joints over the face and can be done more quickly.

### 03IK and FK

Though you can use one without the other, it is best to use both of them in an animation. You can't work without both arms can you? Applying both Inverse and Forward Kinematics in your rig design can help it make more stylistic.

### 04Learn Python and Maya API: Learn Python and Maya API

If you wish to take your rigging skills to the next level then learning Maya API and Python are great millstones. This way, you can create high quality and sophisticated rigs with high intense flexibility on Maya. Also, Python allows you to write new scripts for PlugIns.

### 05Delegate to an Animator

After rigging for several hours it is easy to feel like you are only seeing from one perspective. Get in touch with an animator earlier on in the project can help you get feedback to stay consistent in the rigging process.

### 06Learn Web Technologies: Learn Web Technologies

To be a good animator or rigging specialist involves a lot of learning. Animation technology is constantly changing therefore it is highly recommended to stay up to date with the latest web technologies. Learning HTML, Java Script and CSS is becoming vital to being a part of the gaming world.

### 07Use Scalable Tools

Not all the characters or objects you rig are going to be of the same size. Selecting the right rigging software is crucial for you to be able to scale your animations. You won't need to use everything, just the tools that serve your purpose.

### 08Use a Clean Interface

If you have ever heard of the phrase 'clean workplace – cleaner work' then you should know how an untidy interface can affect your workflow. This won't necessarily change the results but can surely better your experience.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

**●** What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.

**●** Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.

The function of **character rigging** can easily be compared to that of bones, muscles and joints. They act as skeletons to virtual animations. You can also imagine them as strings used on dolls. These digitalized bones function inter-connectedly in a 3D animation.

## Part 4 How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy

**How to Make Character Rig? Are There Any Plugins or Easy**

When we imagine animation, most of the time we are baffled by the end product? But what really goes on behind the mesmerizing colors and whimsical characters.

The basic is of course building rigs to support the entire movement of the character and confine it to actual physical laws that makes it almost a mimic of reality. The entire process of rigging rather simplifies the path to achieve that goal.

In **Cinema, character rigging** has multiple layers that goes into creating the entire skeleton animation. Setting up a character rig can take anywhere between a few hours or a few days. It probably takes mainstream movies ten times that time.

Let us break down the process of making a rig so that it is simpler to understand.

The process;

**Weight Painting:** An integral part of the entire rigging process. Although, weight painting can be rendered automatically by the software that you are using, but that can end up making the animation look less realistic. You can instead fine tune the weight of each bone in the rig. You can also copy similar looking bones and apply them to different mesh and repurpose them to function differently.

**Placing Bones:** After designing a bone structure of character, you can copy the same and use it for similar characters. This is why in games and animation, you notice characters with similar features and traits.

**Inverse Kinematics:** Not all bones are meant to move in a forward direction. This is why inverses Kinematics are applied to certain bones like the legs, shoulders or even a dragon's tail. Setting up the IK of your rig would keep specific bones pointed in the right direction so as to make the animation look more natural.

**Applying Constraints:** The physical realm is built with restrictions. There are things you can do or can't do according to the natural order of things so as to make your character movement more naturalistic.

**Simulation Skeletons:** Now comes the part where the magic happens. After fully completing a skeletal animation you can now simulate the motion over the mesh and record the result of the simulation through a series of frames.

**Create an animated movie:** You can play back the simulation in an animation software such as Blender and then create your own animated movie with **Filmora with its easy drag and drop interface.** Movies are a collage of frames, so you need to animate according to the fps you want for your video.

**Facial Rigs:** Facial expressions are more complex than whole body movements. It requires the attention dedicated to a project of its own. Here is where you can play with deforming shapes together to replicate facial muscle movement.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Rigging has become science in its own right but that does not mean you can't be artistic with it.

**●** What you should remember that creating skeletal animation is all about movement and applying physical restrictions to it.

**●** Start simple and practice until you master the most complex features of any of the top rigging software services raging in the market.

01 [What Is GIF Illustration?](#Part 1)

02 [Best 12 Illusion Gifs](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?

GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.

Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.

These are now used as everything from advertisements to commentary from all walks of life. The users of GIFs seem to be endless! They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.

## Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs

This curated list will help you to know the best **Illusion GIF** that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-

### 01Van Gogh Stare GIF

The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the "dazzle camouflage," is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye's instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/9tXAXIgFsKyuotYjDh)

### 02This brain-busting rotation

We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can't see it from every angle.

### 03This loop tea GIF

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/meme-image-know-K79kKDx86GMik)

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE)

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj)

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik)

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/brain-ca-optical-B45OfCUzIafQs)

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

01 [What Is GIF Illustration?](#Part 1)

02 [Best 12 Illusion Gifs](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?

GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.

Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.

These are now used as everything from advertisements to commentary from all walks of life. The users of GIFs seem to be endless! They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.

## Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs

This curated list will help you to know the best **Illusion GIF** that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-

### 01Van Gogh Stare GIF

The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the "dazzle camouflage," is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye's instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/9tXAXIgFsKyuotYjDh)

### 02This brain-busting rotation

We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can't see it from every angle.

### 03This loop tea GIF

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/meme-image-know-K79kKDx86GMik)

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE)

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj)

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information.

## Part 1 What is Lip-syncing and Its Importance in Animations

In the simplest terms, lip-syncing can be termed as the process and way in which the sound is synchronized to the characters in animation. It is lip-syncing which brings life to the characters and makes them look talking. The process of lip-syncing in animations includes the dialogues and the mouth charts. The dialogues are broken into the phonetic syllables and the frames required for these syllables are then accessed.

Animations are moving and talking images and liveliness come from the dialogues that they speak. So, to make these talks appear real, flawless lip-syncing is very important.

## Part 2 Key Factors to Consider While Lip-syncing in Animations

To make the lip-syncing in your animation look perfect several factors need to be taken care of. Some of these important ones are enlisted below.

### 01 Perfect Match of the Keyframes

The keyframes for the shapes of the words phrase by phrase needs to be perfect to make it look right. The right lip sync will have the correct timings from the mouth open to the mouth close.

### 02 Adding Body Language

To make the characters in your animations look real and lively, adding gestures and body language will play a huge role. Moreover, lip-syncing along with facial expressions will add to the overall richness of the animations.

### 03 Watch Yourself or Record Sample Videos

To get the correct lip-syncing for your animations, you can first try and practice by using a mirror or recording some trial videos. In these videos, you can speak and observe the jaw motion.

### 04 Use Blending

The technique of blending can also be used where the focus is on the most important shape of the mouth rather than each syllable. These shapes can then be blended and used in different ways and combinations.

### 05 Emphasize Eyes

Eyes need special focus as they can be used for expressing several emotions. Especially during the close-up shots in animations, a person looks at the eyes before the rest of the face.

### 06 Use the Apt Voice

No matter how perfectly the lip-syncing is done, it will not look good if the voice does not match the characters in your animations. So, make sure to select the voice that matches the looks and the personality of your characters.
