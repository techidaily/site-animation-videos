Popeye – The Sailor Man is another famous cartoon series. Popeye is the main protagonist of this series. He has a girlfriend named Olive Oyl. This series depicts the love triangle between Popeye, Olive, and Bluto. He is an uneducated sailor man who gets energy by eating spinach. He often comes up with non-realistic solutions to different problems and helps the police by investigating different cases. He has a versatile tobacco smoking pipe that sometimes acts as a whistle, and he even intakes the spinach through his pipe.

In the cartoon films, he looks funny, but this 3D recreation of his character is a bit scary.
