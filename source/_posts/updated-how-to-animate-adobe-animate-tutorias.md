To do that, you need to work on different layers in Photoshop and then merge them as a single frame to provide a more animated appeal. Here are some basic steps that you can follow to come up with anime good night or morning GIFs.

##### Step 1 Launch Photoshop and Load Media Assets

You can start by launching Adobe Photoshop on your system and visiting its File > Scripts section to load your media files.

![adobe photoshop load media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-2.jpg)

##### Step 2 Start working on Animated GIFs in Photoshop

Now, to come up with a funny good morning/night GIF, you can go to its Menu > Layer and choose to create a new layer.

![photoshop add layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-3.jpg)

Since it is recommended to have a timeline for your media, you can go to its Window > Timeline to get a timeline view at the bottom.

![photoshop timeline view](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-4.jpg)

Afterward, you can go to the timeline at the bottom panel and choose work on frame animations to create any good morning/night animation.

![photoshop create animation frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-5.jpg)
