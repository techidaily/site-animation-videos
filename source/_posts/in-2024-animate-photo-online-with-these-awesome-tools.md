If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

#### In this article

01 [All You Need to Know About 2D Rigging](#Part 1)

02 [What is the Difference and Connection Between 2D and 3D](#Part 2)

03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

![2D Character Looking at a Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you2.png)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

![Storyboard Creation. Creating 2D & 3D Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you3.png)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

If you're looking to get a head start in **2D Rigging** or 2D Animation in general, then this guide should get you to where you need to go.

We'll be introducing **2D Rigging** in a comprehensive way — perfect for beginners who aren't familiar with the subject and want something more solid as their foundation.

03 [What Are the Best 2D Rigging Animation Tools?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **All You Need to Know About Rigging**

For this first part, we're going to talk about **Rigging** in a general way. Think of it as an introduction to the subject. One that should, hopefully, set you off on the right foot. It should also help clarify things that you might need to know as we delve into deeper and more advanced subjects in the next sections of this article.

### 01**What is the Meaning of Rigging in Animation?**

Alright, so what does **rigging 2D** characters actually do? What meaning, or effect, does it have? These questions can be quickly answered with this: Rigging (whether it's or 3D) is the practice of attaching ‘bones' to a character model. Bones that, in the future, you can use to create motion.

If you're an artist, then you're probably familiar with the concept of creating an initial sketch that you put the final drawing on top of — done with the sole purpose of creating a structure that will allow you to move forward more easily in your art.

That's exactly what you do when **Rigging**. You're building a structure that will allow you to easily create animated characters that you can move at will in the future.

![Person Drawing Initial Sketch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you1.png)

### 02**Why Use Animation?**

Alright, so what's the difference between creating a **Face Rig** and a Face Rig? Is there any? To answer this, the simple answer is, yes. There is quite the difference.

A lot of animators prefer to practice Animation over Animation because it is more traditional and requires less complicated software (not that it doesn't come with complications of its own.) Specifically, animation requires quite a lengthy character creation and rigging process.

You should consider the subject more based on what project you're working on. Things that you might want to keep in mind include your project timeline, project budget, character rig usability in the future, length of the project, and so on.

(There's also a more in-depth breakdown of this in of this guide.)

![2D Character Looking at a Screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/the-only-guide-you'll-ever-need-to-learn-that-make-2D-rigging-clear-to-clear-to-you2.png)

### 03**What is Animation Rigging Software?**

Now, for the last section of this **Rigging** overview, let's talk about **Rigging Animation Software**. You should be able to guess what it's meant for, but how you can use it is a little different, especially with the many different varieties of **Rigging Animation Software** available.

We'll be introducing some in the third part of this guide — so you can learn more about the differences there. For now, all you need to know is that it usually comes with advanced rigging and character deformer tools that you can use to easily (and efficiently) animate your characters.

## Part 2 **What is the Difference and Connection Between and 3D**

As promised, this next section will be devoted to clarifying the differences and similarities between Animation and Animation. As we mentioned previously, most animators prefer Animation. But, more often than not, they switch between both forms in order to create something suitable for their current project.

### 01**How and Animations Are Created**

First, let's talk about the process involved. In the end, this can be described simply as: it starts off the same, but then becomes significantly more and more dissimilar the further you go along. More specifically, whether you're working on a or Animation, you usually start with working through your vision for the project.

That means exploring ideas and creating hand-illustrated storyboards (which will serve as the foundation for the project as a whole). Then, the next steps involve media gathering (i.e., character creation, sound clips, voice-overs, sound effects, etc.) So that everything would be ready for the project.

This is when the difference starts. Animation involves hand-drawing characters in different poses and angles (with the standard being frames for a second) and can be completed with basic **rigging** (i.e., **face rig** for moving mouths or eyes). It's normal in Animation as well for characters to remain static for several frames. While, with 3D, it is the exact opposite — the characters must be in constant motion so as to remain realistic (which can be done with extensive rigging.)

### 02**Time Investments for Creating and Animations**

Next, let's talk about time investments. This can be a bit tricky to differentiate. Animations, as mentioned, are generally easier to create because it requires less rigging (but more drawings for certain scenes and angles makes it take more time). Meanwhile, Animation usually involves a front-heavy timeline — since you're looking at intensive character creation and rigging. Once all this is set up though? The rest of the process is much faster than Animation.

You'll also have to consider the work that you have to put in after your animations have been created. For example, the work you'll need to put into finalizing your project with a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which would work great with animations especially, as it will allow you to actively add into the timeline as you go.)

## Part 3 **What Are the Best Rigging Animation Tools?**

For this final section of the guide, we're finally moving on to our introduction to **Rigging Animation Software**. As mentioned, we've picked quite the variety to make sure that you have a good idea of how each will work. (A sample video has also been attached to make sure that you know what kind of projects can be created with these **Rigging** tools. Take the opportunity to explore those, too. If only for further edification.)

### 01**Reallusion – Cartoon Animator 4**

The first of the **Rigging Animation Software** on this list is Reallusion's Cartoon Animator 4 (previously known as CrazyTalk Animator). This software was originally developed in order to allow everyone (from beginners to professionals) to create advanced animations with very little effort. To that end, it comes with a lot of motion templates and **Auto Rig** functions (i.e., audio lip-syncing) that the user can use to seriously cut down on the work required.

### 02**Harmony ToonBoom**

Harmony ToonBoom is well-known in the **Rigging Animation Software** industry. It's the software that is used by many professionals. According to the Toon Boom Harmony website, this software was even used to create popular television shows like Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers, The Simpsons, and Futurama. It's considerably more difficult to use for beginners, but it comes with many advanced functions that allow its users to create truly complex and beautiful Animations.

### 03**Synfig Studio**

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing).

The best thing about Synfig Studio (right from the onset), is that it is FREE. There are two versions of this tool — one that is ‘stable' and the other in ‘development.' The developmental version offers more advanced functions, of course, but for most beginners, the ‘stable' version would serve just as well.

### 04**Adobe Animate**

Adobe Animate is software that belongs in Adobe's long line of professional-level products. It's a part of the classic ‘Adobe Suite.' As a professional software, however, keep in mind that it might be more difficult to get used to at first (there's a steep, learning curve right off the bat). But, if used correctly, it can be used to create quite impressive and eye-catching interactive animations (i.e., game content or website elements.)

### 05**Animaker**

Animaker is quite popular for beginners. It offers templates, so you can start off with an easy project if that's what you'd like. But it also offers a lot of custom-creation tools that can be used for creating complex and professional Animations — although perhaps not at the level as the ones you might see from other alternatives (this software is most suitable for simple animations.)

### 06**Moho Pro**

Moho Pro (previously known as Anime Studio Pro) is a popular Animation program that fans of anime really love. This is one of the best software to use if you're more interested in traditional animation (which involves a lot of free-hand drawing). Although, despite that fact, it has many advanced **rigging** functions as well (so you can create a mix of traditional and modern animation if you wish.)

### 07**Pencil 2D**

Pencil 2D, much like Synfig Studio, is FREE, cross-platform software. It's quite old, but it's matured over the years to include more and more functions (you might already be personally aware of it, in fact. It had its time to shine in the early 2010s.) The important thing to remember though is the fact that this is definitely more of a ‘traditional animation' software. It does offer some basic rigging, but it's best used by those who would prefer to practice the art of frame-by-frame animation.

### 08**OpenToonz**

OpenToonz is another free **Rigging Animation Software** (although it should be noted that there is a premium version, called Toonz, that is quite well known.) The best part about it is that it is a combination of software. One that you can use both for traditional animation and Animation. It's also pretty easy to use, making it a good option for those just starting out.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** 2D Rigging is the practice of creating ‘structure' or ‘bones' from which you can move characters or models. In these are usually ‘pins' placed in bendable areas (i.e., the elbow, for bending the arm.)

**●** There are many differences between Animation and Animation. What you end up choosing should be decided by your project.

**●** Remember though, that Animations usually take longer to create even though Animations require more complex riggings.

**●** If you're serious about getting into **Rigging**, make sure to consider the **Rigging Animation Software** that you choose to use very carefully. Each one has its own pros and cons.

"Where is everyone getting their **3D Text Animation** templates?"

To answer this request, we've compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like **3D Spinning Text (After Effects)** but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., **3D Text Animation** templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.

#### In this article

01 [Top 10 3D Text Animation Templates ](#Part 1)

02 [How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?](#Part 2)

03 [The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates](#Part 3)

04 [Secrets to Learning More Animation Tactics](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

![Add Graphic Elements to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates5.png)

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!

**●** You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.

**●** Of course, if you don't have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you're looking for.

To answer this request, we've compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like **3D Spinning Text (After Effects)** but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., **3D Text Animation** templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode
