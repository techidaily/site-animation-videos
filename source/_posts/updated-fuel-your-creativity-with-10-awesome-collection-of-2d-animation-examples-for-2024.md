**Creative logo tips:**

![creative logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animate-discord-profile-picture-18.jpg)

Some tips you can keep in mind while creating logo are as follows:

**‚óè** Be specific to your brand. Be sure that you are not choosing a logo that may deviate customers from your brand perspective.

**‚óè** Always choose colors in contrast because a single color logo does not seem to be appealing.

**‚óè** Make sure to choose a template that is easy to understand. If the template seems to be difficult to understand, a user will not be able to get it.

**‚óè** Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.

**‚óè** Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.

**‚óè** Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.
