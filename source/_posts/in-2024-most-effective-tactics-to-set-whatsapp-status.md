To answer this request, we've compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like **3D Spinning Text (After Effects)** but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., **3D Text Animation** templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!

**●** You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.

**●** Of course, if you don't have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you're looking for.

**●** SECRET TIP! If you're looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It's a video editor, first and foremost, but that's not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!

**●** You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.

**●** Of course, if you don't have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you're looking for.

**●** SECRET TIP! If you're looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It's a video editor, first and foremost, but that's not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

Claymation videos appear to be more appealing as compared to other graphical or pictorial videos we create. However, some people still believe that making such a video is not their forte and that they cannot achieve mastery in the field.

![claymation intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/ways-you-can-master-to-make-claymation-videos-1.jpg)

So, if you have the same question and want to learn how to make a claymation video quickly and easily, stay tuned with us. In this article, we are covering all the relevant details to help you create the best claymation video possible and the outcome will be as expected. Let’s get started!

#### In this article

01 [What is Claymation and How It Works](#Part 1)

02 [History of Claymation Movies](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Claymation Videos of All Time](#Part 3)

04 [How to Make Claymation Videos](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is Claymation and How It Works

With the name Claymation, you might be thinking that there is a use of clay in creating such videos. Well, you are right. These videos are representations of stop-motion animation, which is created with the help of plasticine clay.

![what is claymation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/ways-you-can-master-to-make-claymation-videos-2.jpg)

The use of platicsine is not only restricted to the animated characters, but these are also considered for creating the ultimate surroundings. The videos are recorded in such a manner that synchronization must be established with background and character, and viewers will be able to enjoy the same. After creating the videos, they are played in quick succession to get the right appearance of the movement.

## Part 2 History of Claymation Movies

### 01The Beginning of Claymation Movies

Well, you will be surprised to know that the Claymation videos came into existence after the introduction of plasticine. It was founded in 189and since then, clamaytion videos have been able to find their way to silver screens. In earlier times, people used to dip their toes into color and then try to create artwork. But with innovation, the process has been changed and the oldest known extant clay animation film is **Long Live the Bull (1926)** by Joseph Sunn. The main procedure for creating this film is Claymation.

![history of claymation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/ways-you-can-master-to-make-claymation-videos-3.jpg)

This is because people would see your carousel on their home feed just like any other pin you have posted. They may also tap on the carousel and swipe through the different photos on the carousel. When the pinner saves it, they have kept the entire image.

Here is a step-by-step method to upload multiple photos to Pinterest.

**Step 1: Log into your Pinterest**

First, log into your Pinterest business account to access the feature. If you do not have a business account, it is elementary to do so. There is no need for you to enter any billing information if you are wondering about that. It is a straightforward process. Just open your account, click on the drop-down menu near your profile picture, see 'convert to business,' then upgrade your account, and you are good to go.

You should also ensure that the photos you want to upload are on your computer. If you have originally planned to use it to explain an article visually, then make sure the particular image that represents that article is correctly saved on your computer. The images should be 1:1 or 2:3 in ratio, and the format either 'png' or 'jpeg.'

Add your pictures and upload. If you want to reorder your pin, you can replace or remove images within the carousel.

![Log into your Pinterest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-4.jpg)

**Step 2: Add Title**

Add a title, description, and website of the carousel pin. Your title will be a snippet of what the blog post or article will be about or the recipe's title. Your description should be the same as your Pinterest text, and you can also choose to let it appear only on your first image on your carousel pin.

**Step 3: Select a Board**

The last step is to select a board relevant to your carousel pin. Thus, you have your carousel pin and images. However, you cannot view this immediately as in a standard pin or video pin. But you can go back to your board to view your pin when it is ready.

Slideshows are a collection of images arranged together that an audience can quickly swipe through to view the content. Pinterest is known for its one-pin to one post feature. You cannot post more than one image or video in a pin.

Thus, business people could start sharing all of the images or products, services, or articles mostly because it can be stressful to do that. But with the **Pinterest slideshow**, you can now upload all the images you want to at once in one pin. Moreso, even have people view the pins simultaneously just by swiping through.

## Part 1 **How to Display Pinterest Latest Pins in A Slideshow**

Using Pinterest's latest pins in a slideshow is another way to display the latest pins from any Pinterest user or blogger's blog. Each image is linked to its pin page on Pinterest instead of the board or profile page if you use the Pinterest profile or board widget.

To install this widget, you need the user or board's RSS feed URL, then use it as the input for a blogger slide show gadget.

Here are the tricky steps to follow for **the Pinterest slide show**;

**Step 1: Constructing Pinterest RSS feed URL**

The Pinterest RSS feed URL of a user is different from aboard.

**●** It would be the user's profile URL + feed/RSS for a user. To get your Profile URL, click on your username in the top right corner of your screen, and you will see a URL in your web browser's URL. That is your profile URL.

**●** For the board URL, you will get that after clicking on the board from the homepage. The URL would appear on your browser's URL bar.

![Construct Pinterest Feed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Reformatting the feed for the slideshow gadget:**

The RSS feed from step one is not very compatible with the blogger slideshow gadget. It accepts RSS feed in Media RSS format, but you can convert with Yahoo pipe. Simply plug in your feed URL in the Yahoo pipe URL.

You have to replace the value of the feed URL with the feed URL you got in step one and the pin count with the number of pins displayed on the slide show.

With this, you have successfully converted your feed URL to the media version of the Pinterest feed.

**Step 3: Add the slideshow widget**

Take the following step to add the slideshow widget.

Go to Dashboard > Layout and click on 'Add A Gadget.'

Now Add, A Gadget window, scroll down and select Slideshow.

![Add the Slideshow Widget](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-2.jpg)

Under Source, select Other.

![Add the Slideshow Widget 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-pinterest-slideshow-3.jpg)

Put in the converted Pinterest RSS feed URL from step 2 into the Feed URL text box.

Click Save and view your blog.

Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.

**●** First, you draw the face but make sure you don't add a nose but do a black outline.

**●** Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don't use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.

**●** Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.

**●** Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-8.png)

![how to draw your own cartoon character 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-9.png)

**Step 3:** Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png)

**Step 4:** Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-11.png)

**Step 5:** Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-12.png)

![how to draw your own cartoon character 06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-13.png)

**Step 7:** Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 07](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-14.png)
