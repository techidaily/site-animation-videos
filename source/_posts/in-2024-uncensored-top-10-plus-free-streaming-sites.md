## Part 1: Top 10 Banned Anime List

Here is a list of the 10 banned animes you should know about and why they are banned:

### 1\. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）

It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.

![shoujo-tsubaki](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-shoujo-tsubaki.jpg)

### 2\. Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)

Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series' first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show's first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.

![osomatsu-san](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-osomatsu-san.jpg)

### 3\. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)

Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it's too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.

![excel saga](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-excel-saga.jpg)

### 4\. Death Note (Banned in China)

Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it’s gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.

![death-note](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-death-note.jpg)

### 5\. Attack on Titan (Banned in China)

Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!

![attack-on-titan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-attack-on-titan.jpg)

### 6\. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)

With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.

![high-school-dxd](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-high-school-dxd.jpg)

### 7\. Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)

Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni _Puny Poemy_ is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.

![puni-puny-poemy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-puni-puny-poemy.jpg)

### 8\. Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)

Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.

![hetalia-axis-powers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hetalia-axis-powers.jpg)

### 9\. Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)

Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps _THE_ most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?

![pokeman-banned-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-pokeman-banned-anime.jpg)

### 10\. Kite (Banned in Norway)

Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.

The show is about death, justice, murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on kids.

![death-note](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-death-note.jpg)

### 5\. Attack on Titan (Banned in China)

Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the best anime out there!

![attack-on-titan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-attack-on-titan.jpg)

### 6\. High School DxD (Banned in New Zealand)

With very high viewer ratings, it’s a bit of shock to see this show on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset. This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.

![high-school-dxd](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-high-school-dxd.jpg)

### 7\. Puni Puny Poemy (Banned in New Zealand)

Puni Puny Poemy sounds super cute and childish but don’t let the name fool you. Puni _Puny Poemy_ is a spin-off inspired by Excel Saga – no wonder is it banned. This anime has a lot of sexual content surrounding very young characters. The nudity, explicit sexual scenes and harem inspired content is what makes this show so questionable. Thus, it is banned in New Zealand for being overly vulgar and sexual for young viewers. The show does not have a high viewership such as popular titles like Death Note or Attack on Titan, so many countries ignored it.

![puni-puny-poemy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-puni-puny-poemy.jpg)

### 8\. Hetalia: Axis Powers (Banned in South Korea)

Every character in this show represents a country and the role they played in World War II. Even though it is a comedy anime, it offended a few countries. South Korea actually banned the show on the grounds of “offensive stereotypes” and was called a “national crime” by the country. Hetalia: Axis Powers continued to air, the character and all the references to South Korea were completely removed due to backlash. The censored version of this anime is still available in some parts of the country.

![hetalia-axis-powers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-hetalia-axis-powers.jpg)

### 9\. Pokémon (Banned in Saudi Arabia)

Pokemon banned? Pokemon is perhaps _THE_ most famous and innocent anime ever. It’s kid friendly and super clean. So, why is a show about Satoshi and his pocket monster banned? The religious authorities of Saudi Arabia declared that Pokemon promotes gambling and Jewish sentiments. Since then, there have been many conspiracy theories revolving around the show claiming it to be a Zionist conspiracy. Thus, it is banned in Saudi Arabia. Crazy right?

![pokeman-banned-anime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-pokeman-banned-anime.jpg)

### 10\. Kite (Banned in Norway)

Kite follows the story of a girl who uses bullets to kill people and make them explode. Now, you must be thinking that the violent nature of the show got it banned in Norway. Nope! not the case. Kite is banned in Norway due to a very graphic sexual assault scene on a minor. Norway has very strict laws against child pornography, thus the entire anime got banned. Similarly, the United States also censored and removed certain parts of the movie but it is not banned there.

## Part 1: Top 10 Banned Anime List

Here is a list of the 10 banned animes you should know about and why they are banned:

### 1\. Shoujo Tsubaki (Banned Everywhere）

It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs anything. So, after her mother’s death, she goes to find the man and ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers traumatized – so much so that the tapes of this film were also destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere, including Japan itself.

![shoujo-tsubaki](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-shoujo-tsubaki.jpg)

### 2\. Osomatsu-San (Banned in Japan)

Osomatsu-San is banned in Japan due to copyright issues. The series' first episode had parodies of famous anime shows including Attack on Titan, Naruto, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, and more. Thus, due to copyright, the show's first episode was removed from airing. It is still not available on mainstream anime websites. You can find the DVD version of the show, but even those do not have the first episode.

![osomatsu-san](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-osomatsu-san.jpg)

### 3\. Excel Saga (Banned in Japan)

Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination. The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last episode, called “Going Too Far” – very fitting indeed. It is even banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got banned is that it's too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive. Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.

In the recent few years, videos have become the primary tool for marketers to attract their target customers. Unlike banners and pamphlets, videos are relatively more engaging and make it easier for marketers to establish a connection with the viewers. Now, each brand has different preferences when it comes to choosing the right video marketing strategy.

While some brands opt for conventional video advertisements, others get a bit creative and introduce **graphics animation** to their videos to make them more captivating. Of course, if you want to maximize the user's attention and retain more customers, you would prefer the latter. Animated videos are more engaging and also sets the brand apart from the rest of the crowd.

02 [What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?](#Part 2)

03 [5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics](#Part 3)

04 [How to Create Animated Graphics That Stand Out](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Why Study Graphic Design and Animation?

So, why should you care about graphic design and animation? The answer is pretty simple - because these two concepts can help you step up your brand’s marketing game and attract maximum leads. By incorporating graphics and animations into your videos, you’ll be able to make them highly engaging.

However, user engagement isn’t the only reason why **graphics and animations** should be a part of your marketing strategy. They can also be used to simplify complex topics and explain them in an interactive manner. Let’s say you want to explain the overall working of a particular product. Instead of creating a boring tutorial, you can design explainer white paper animations to explain each step in detail and help viewers understand the overall dynamics of the product more conveniently.

Similarly, the applications of animated videos are endless. From product promotion to everyday marketing, they can help businesses in different scenarios and maximize the results.

## Part 2 What's the Difference Between Motion Graphics and Animation?

Now, whenever we talk about **graphic animation videos**, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.

### 01Motion Graphics

![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

![graphic design template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-2.jpg)

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

![use gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-5.jpg)

Now, whenever we talk about **graphic animation videos**, people often get confused between motion graphics and simple animations. While both these terms are in correlation, there are certain factors that separate motion graphics from animations. In layman terms, all motion graphics are animations, but not all animations are motion graphics. To give you a better clarity, we have explained both motion graphics and animations in detail.

### 01Motion Graphics

![motion graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-1.jpg)

Motion Graphics are one of the sub-categories of animations that are primarily created to add motion to still images. The flashing logos you see on different websites are the perfect example of motion graphics. The primary objective of motion graphics is to make designs more appealing. A traditional website logo may not grab the visitor’s attention, but if it has a slight movement, it’ll most likely draw the eyeballs, even if someone is visiting the website for the first time. In general, designers apply motion graphics to objects and texts to enhance their visual appearance.

Moreover, motion graphics can also make it easier to educate people on a certain topic. For instance, a still image may not clarify the overall USPs of your brand. However, by designing a dedicated motion graphics, you’ll be able to explain everything and connect with the potential customers more effectively. Some designers also use motion graphics to simply uplift the overall visual appearance of their designs.

Whatever the reason, using motion graphics in 20can make you reach your marketing objectives more conveniently.

### 02Animations

Animation, on the other hand, is a general broader Umbrella term that’s used to define a wide variety of visual representations. As we mentioned earlier, motion graphics are also a part of **graphics animations.** However, animations aren’t just limited to moving text/objects. According to the official definition, an animation can be explained as a video in which motion is introduced to make static objects move in the landscape.

The general idea of an animation is to convey a storyline in an interactive manner while keeping the customers engaged. Animations are usually divided into two categories, i.e., animations and animations. White paper animations are a great example of animations as the entire movement is in a two-dimensional landscape. In animations, on the other hand, the movement is not restricted to two dimensions only. Cartoons and animated series are the perfect example of animations as the objects are allowed to move in a three dimensional landscape.

## Part 3 5 Graphic Design Techniques for Motion Graphics

So, now that you know how motion graphics differ from the regular animations, let’s understand the tactics to design motion graphics as a beginner. Of course, if you are planning to step into the world of animated videos, you are less likely to start with **graphic animation videos**. A better starting point would be something as simple as a motion graphics animation. Here are 5 tactics that’ll guide you the right way while creating a **motion graphics animation** for the first time.

### 01Start With a Template

Now, when it comes to designing a motion graphics animation, you can either start on a blank canvas or choose one of the ready-to-use templates to speed up the entire designing process. As an absolute beginner, it would be better to choose the latter as it’ll require less designing from your part.

Working on a blank canvas is quite a challenging task, especially when you don’t have years of experience as a designer. But, with a ready made template, you can start with the editing process right away. There are a plethora of editing platforms like Canva, PicArt, and Visme where you’ll find motion graphics templates. These templates are fully customizable, which means you can manipulate their design to meet your specific brand requirements.

### 02Be Subtle With Personal Branding

Now, even if you are choosing a built-in template, it would be crucial to customize its color scheme so that it matches the overall theme of your brand. Let’s say you are using red and white colors on your website. So, while designing the motion graphics, make sure to change its existing color scheme with red and white so that it can go with your website in a hassle-free manner.

In addition to the color scheme, you can also use other visual elements that represent your brand in the digital landscape. However, do not overdo the personal branding as it may also backfire and affect the quality of your **motion graphics animation.**

![subtle personal branding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-3.jpg)

### 03Do Not Add Unnecessary Elements

It’s also worth noting that any unnecessary element in your motion graphics design will only make it cluttered and damage the overall user experience. Before you publish the motion graphics on any online portal, make sure to analyze it from users’ point-of-view. In case you find any invaluable elements, go ahead and remove them from the design.

![unnecessary element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tips-for-learning-graphics-animation-4.jpg)

### 04Design Multiple Variations

It’s not necessary that the first motion graphic you design will be worth publishing on your website. That’s why it’s always necessary to design multiple variations so that you can upload the most appealing design on your website. Some designers also A/B test their motion graphics design to choose the best design among all the variations. In any case, having multiple variations will only help you maintain the high market standards.

### 05Use GIF Format

Finally, once your **motion graphics animation** is ready, go ahead and save it in GIF format. With GIF format, you’ll be able to upload the picture across all platforms and ensure that the object movement inside the motion graphics doesn’t get affected at all.

## Part 1  5 Best Places to Find Animated Christmas GIFs for Free

While there are plenty of websites and apps, I would recommend exploring the following sources to find Merry Christmas animated GIFs for free.

### 1\. Pinterest

Pinterest has to be one of the best sources to get free Christmas GIFs of all kinds. While some GIFs can readily be downloaded from Pinterest, you might be redirected to third-party websites at times. Also, before you use any GIF from Pinterest, make sure you check its copyright policy.

Mostly, you would find aesthetically pleasing Merry Christmas wishes GIFs on Pinterest about DIY activities, food, animations, and so on. The only issue is that the range of GIFs at Pinterest is pretty extensive, and there are no inbuilt categories or filters.

It all started in the 1960s in Japan and until now anime has only changed people’s lives and their thinking with the pseudo content. People these days especially teenagers and university students are watching a lot of anime shows online because they have found it much better than the real world where the anime series online would encourage them to be good friends, socially active, and intelligent.

Recently one of my friends asks me if I could recommend some anime series to her. Then I wrote this article to show the **best 10 anime series of all time**. And I also list some new anime series in 2020.
