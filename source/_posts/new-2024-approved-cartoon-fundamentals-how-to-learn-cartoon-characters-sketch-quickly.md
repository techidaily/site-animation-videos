The WhatsApp feature on your iPhone as well as Android devices comes integrated with a GIF library powered by Tenor that allows you to search for GIFs using desired keywords. The steps to send GIFs through the method for both iPhone, as well as Android, are almost the same.

Step 1\. Open WhatsApp and select the contact or the group chat to whom you wish to send the GIF.

On your Android phone, click on the smiley emoji at the input section and then choose GIF at the bottom of the screen. A sample of GIF will appear. On your iPhone, you need to click on the sticker icon to launch GIF options.

Step 2\. Enter the desired keyword at the search icon to look out for a more specific GIF.

Step 3\. Tap on the selected GIF and then if needed add a caption as well.

Step 4\. Finally, click on the Send icon to share the GIF to the chat.

## Part 3 How to create WhatsApp GIF using videos

Step 2\. After the video is added, trim it under 6 seconds using the slider at the top. Add the caption or other available elements if needed.

Step 3\. Click on the GIF button and then tap on the Send icon.
