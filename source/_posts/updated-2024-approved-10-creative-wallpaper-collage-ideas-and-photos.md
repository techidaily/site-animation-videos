### 01Step Arrange images

The first thing is to place all the images you want to use in the final production of the video into a folder. Then arrange them accordingly in the same ways they should appear in the video.

### 02Step Launch Software

Launch Filmora and click on create a new project and add the project you made to the Filmora media tab. Also, import all audio files you want to use in your project before doing any actual editing.

### 03Step Edit Media

Move to the File menu, click on the preferred option, and go to the edit tab to set the maximum duration of a photo in the video you are creating. The value you are inserting into the photo duration box is determined by the number of frames in your video.

Please note that Filmora does not allow you to reduce a video frame rate below 23.97FPS. Therefore if you want your LEGO animation to have frame-per-second, you should send the photo duration value to 00:00:04.

### 04Step Preview

After that, you can add your media access to the timeline and click on the Play button to preview the results. When satisfied with the results, you can export your LEGO animated video from Filmora.
