## Part 1  How to Create Your Own Custom Animated Whatsapp Stickers

Now, before we go any further, I would like to point out that Whatsapp doesn’t allow users to directly create a custom cartoon sticker. There’s no AR feature that’ll turn your face into a cartoon character. So, to use a **cartoon Whatsapp profile picture**, you’ll have to rely on a third-party tool to get the job done. Based on which platform you use to access Whatsapp, you can choose a wide variety of Whatsapp animated sticker creators and use them to design custom cartoon stickers to make traditional Whatsapp conversations more fun.

One of the easiest ways to create custom stickers for Whatsapp is to use Wondershare **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. Filmora is a full-scale video editing software that’s specifically designed to help editors unleash their creativity and create stunning movies for different platforms.
