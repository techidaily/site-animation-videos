It's a very open subject.

### 01**GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads**

The best part of GIFs is that they are easily consumable media that you can share just about everywhere. For example, you can include them in your email marketing to bring a little life to what could have otherwise been a very dry message You can also have it play out on social media without prompting (different from videos, which the user usually has to play before it starts going.)

### 02**GIFs Can Be Used for Promoting Events**

GIFs are also great for promoting events or holiday sales It's basically just a moving 2D advertisement (like the one that is shown below). Eye-catching in a way that keeps you looking to catch the movement — in compared to if you were just looking at a still image (which might catch your attention for a moment, but usually bores you the next)

### 03**GIFs Can Be Used for Call-to-Action Pop-Ups**

Perhaps you've seen this already in some YouTube videos (see the GIF attached for an example), but a lot of content creators now include GIFs on their content to prompt their audience to complete an action — be it subscribing, sharing, downloading a link, buying a product, etc. It's a great way of getting a message across in a way that is both fun and straightforward

### 04**GIFs Can Be Used to Set the Scene and Express Emotion**

GIFs are also a great way to just generally set the scene or express emotion. Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving' pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.

### 05**GIFs Can Be Used to Tell a Story**

You know the saying, "A picture can speak a thousand words?" Well, it's true, but in comparison to GIFs??? Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example.

### 06**GIFs Can Be Used to Explain or Share Instructions**

In the same way that you can create long infographics to offer instructions or teach a lesson on a particular subject, GIFs can be used to educate your audience. Only, it's a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below

**Stars**: 7.9

**Votes**: 13,266

**Summary:** The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, 'Star vs. the Forces of Evil' This is an American animated 'magical-girl' television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)

The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

**Summary:** We go back into the older **Disney animated shows** a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called 'Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles' instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action/adventure show.

It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.

The demographics for this one mainly comprises of very young children. But, if you like, it's a safe-for-viewing show that you can have your kids watch and keep distracted And, perhaps, along the way, you can find some joy in these classic characters coming back to life.

## Top 7 **A Goofy Movie**

**Duration**: 1995 \[78 min\]

**Genre**: Animation, Adventure, Comedy

**Rating**: G

Which, spoilers, sees the main characters (Goody and his son, Max) into their newest adventures Max is in high school in this film, far older than he was in the TV show. It gives the film a different sort of feel. But it's not less comedic than before And, with the extra splash of adventure, it's sure to provide a good time

In any case, the nostalgia factor is strong with this one The series has inspired many adaptations. And, with its revival on Disney XD in 2015, its popularity has only continued to grow

Just in case you're unfamiliar with this zany cast of characters. It all starts off with Donald Duck, who kicks off the show by joining the US Navy and handing off the care of his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie to his uncle Scrooge McDuck

**Summary:** The fourth most popular of the **Disney animated shows** on IMBD is Phineas and Ferb This is an action/comedy series that ran all from 2007 to 2015 And yes, that does mean that this show is 100% now binge-able from start to end

This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn't make it any less fun

**Stars**: 8.1

**Votes**: 7,522

**Summary:** While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), 'The Owl House' is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)

The story's main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She's a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.

There she meets "The Owl Lady" Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn't stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.

Previously, before the presence of motion graphics in the world of technology the graphics worked just the images in the un-moving and flat formats.

Motion graphics first came into the scene when Oskar Fischinger and Norman McLaren were doing some experimental work. Later in 195some designers introduced motion graphics to the public in a bigger way. The designers later used in a few films that time and these films are still a great example of the motion graphics used at that time. Motion graphics in these films presented information such as the product company, actors, film directors, movie title, and many other things about the films in a very creative way.

Playing with the words or graphic elements was never seen by the people before the motion graphics. Later it’s started used in mostly all films and ad videos.

A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 2 **Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?**
