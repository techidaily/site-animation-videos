## Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps

We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.

Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.

### 1\. GIPHY

![giphy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg)

The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.

Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.

It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.

### 2\. Motionleap

![motionleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg)

Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.

Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there's a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn't put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.

The app's primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.

You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.

Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you've paid for a Pro account.

### 3\. Movepic

![movepic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg)

Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.

The only limitation is that you wouldn't be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.

### 4\. ImgPlay

![imgplay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg)

ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can't remove unless you update to a complete account.

The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.

### 5\. Zoetropic

On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you're considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.

### 6\. StoryZ

![storyz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg)

Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.

One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.

### 7\. Lumyer

![lumyer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg)

Lumyer is one of the useful animated photo collage apps on our list, which lets you add hundreds and thousands of effects to your pictures to animate them. So whether you wish to include sparkle or subtle weather effects, seasonal animations for Christmas and Halloween, or all-out scene transformations like appearing on a rollercoaster, Lumyer can do it.

If you're okay with the watermark, Lumyer is a good choice, but otherwise, you may prefer one of our other recommended photo animation college apps.

### 8\. VIMAGE 3D

![vimage 3d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-9.jpg)

VIMAGE got recognized with Google Play award in 2018\. It can make some pretty good-looking animated photos in just a few clicks. There's a wide variety of animations, filters, and sounds to select among a bundle of options.

### 9\. Photo Bender

![photo bender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-7.jpg)

Photo Bender is an Android-specific animated photo collage app that helps you warp to animate photos digitally by coloring your image by stretching it, bending it, and using brushes. You can then export your transformed images as GIFs, JPEGs, MP4s, and PNGs.

While this app doesn't contain ratings like others on this list, it is highly rated, so it's still worth a look.

### 10\. Werble

![werble](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-10.jpg)

The primary purpose of Werble is to animate your images, and while the basic account is free, in-app purchases are also available. Most of Werble's animations come through different filter effects that you can add on top of your images.

A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they're ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.

02 [Wondershare Filmora: The Advanced Editing App of 2022!](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps

We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.

Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.

### 1\. GIPHY

![giphy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg)

The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.

Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.

It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.

### 2\. Motionleap

![motionleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg)

Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.

Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there's a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn't put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.

The app's primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.

You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.

Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you've paid for a Pro account.

### 3\. Movepic

![movepic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg)

Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.

The only limitation is that you wouldn't be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.

### 4\. ImgPlay

![imgplay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg)

ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can't remove unless you update to a complete account.

The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.

### 5\. Zoetropic

![zoetropic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg)

If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren't as extensive as other apps we've mentioned, it does the job pretty well.

To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.

On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you're considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.

### 6\. StoryZ

![storyz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg)

Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.

One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.

### 7\. Lumyer

![lumyer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg)

Lumyer is one of the useful animated photo collage apps on our list, which lets you add hundreds and thousands of effects to your pictures to animate them. So whether you wish to include sparkle or subtle weather effects, seasonal animations for Christmas and Halloween, or all-out scene transformations like appearing on a rollercoaster, Lumyer can do it.

If you're okay with the watermark, Lumyer is a good choice, but otherwise, you may prefer one of our other recommended photo animation college apps.

### 8\. VIMAGE 3D

![vimage 3d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-9.jpg)

Those who make it big are known to brave the storm. The ones who follow the crowd just turn out to be ordinary. However, those who innovate, rise to a higher level. Here is why you should go for a **website with animated logo**!

### 01They grab viewers attraction

The human mind chooses to believe in the supremacy of what appeals to them visually. It is highly important to grab the user's attention in order to make a mark. Animated logos help your website to visually appeal to the viewer and grab his/her attention. Potential customers will tend to remember the logo of your website and this would directly impact the conversion rates of your website.

![grab viewers attention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-websites-with-animated-logos-that-can-catch-your-eyes-01.jpg)

### 02Increase in brand awareness

Brand awareness is key to a website’s success. As we saw earlier, people often tend to remember brands by their logo and not name. An attractive animated logo will help you create a strong brand awareness among potential customers and help your brand gain popularity.

![Increase in brand awareness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-websites-with-animated-logos-that-can-catch-your-eyes-02.jpg)

### 03Animated logos can convey more

A brand logo is supposed to be the identity of a brand. The logo should be capable enough of explaining your website’s understanding about the field. For instance, if your company is in the cyber security domain, the logo should be good enough to justify your company’s expertise. Animated logos help you establish trust by conveying more through the medium of a logo.

![Increase in brand awareness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-websites-with-animated-logos-that-can-catch-your-eyes-03.jpg)

## Part 2 4 Awesome Ways to Use Logo Animation

### 01They can serve as introductions to marketing videos

Video marketing is one of the most commonly used marketing techniques. Research suggested that about 99 percent of brands use video marketing in order to enhance their brand image. Starting of your video with an animated logo will not just look catchy but also make the video all the more professional.

### 02They can make great outros

Just like animated videos can serve as amazing introductory bits of the video, they can also be the perfect outros to videos. If you haven’t added your animated logo in the introduction of the video then they can be added at the end. This will lead to your viewers remembering your brand for a longer time.

### 03Look very attractive at trade shows

Trade shows are opportunities where websites and company owners can interact with investors and potential customers face to face. It’s an excellent opportunity to make your mark on the big stage. Logos of companies may be projected on the big screen in such events. At such events when you have just a few seconds to make a mark, you need your logo to grab the viewer's attention. Hence, animated logos could be very useful.

### 04They could be a great addition to your company’s email signature

Emails are regarded as the 3rd largest information sources in the B2B industry. It is one of the largest means of communication and marketing. Email signatures have been around for years; however the traditional email signatures have now gone out of fashion. Contemporary email signatures include animated logos to leave a bigger impact on the receiver. Using animated logos, you can add grace to your email signatures and escape the ordinary.

## Part 3 6 of the Best Animated Logos

### 01Mastercard

Mastercard is one of the first companies to use animated logos. The logo is simply fantastic due to the meaning it conveys without any complex animation. The animated logo involves the traditional venn diagram logo of mastercard morphing into several objects. These objects include everything from food to groceries to luxurious products. It basically includes the various kinds of commodities people buy using mastercards.

### 02Burger king

Another popular brand that uses animated logos is the american fast food giant, burger king. The logo is not highly flashy like we see in mastercard. However, the animated logo does obviously look more attention seeking than the conventional static logo. The logo shows the stacking of the different elements of the logo one by one over each other. This resembles the process of making a burger.

### 03Fedex

Another logo that would classify as a flashy animated logo is the fedex logo. Initially, fedex had experimented with several logos before sticking to the arrow logo which continues even today. The animated logo involves an arrow making the letter “Fedex” with its trajectory and then finally settling in between letters X and E. The logistics giant delivers couriers from one corner of the world to another, and the arrow symbolizes exactly that!

### 04Flickr

Flickr is a popular stock image and video hosting platform. Anyone can use the stock images and videos in their content. The logo starts with a blue and pink dot initially. These dots later expand in a whirlpool like motion. The logo starts off with the static logo before it expands. The idea is to show that the online stock image portal goes beyond limits and has every picture and video you’d need

### 05Bundle

## Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs

First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some **3D GIF Maker** tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of **3D GIF Maker** tools and **3D GIF Generator** tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.

### 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first **3D GIF Maker** on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a **3D GIF Maker**, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.

 **Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)**

### 022\. Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere **3D GIF Maker**. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.

The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.

### 03EaseUS Video Editor

Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a **3D GIF Creator** quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.

The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)

## Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a **3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker**, and so on.)

### 01Step 1: Launch **[Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

First things first, launch the **3D GIF maker** that you intend to use. In our case, that is Filmora (a screenshot has been provided below for your edification and reference. We’ll be using Filmora as our example.)

### 02Step 2: Upload File(s)

Next, upload the file or files that you want to turn into a GIF.

As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media > Import Media File. However, you can also drag and drop your file(s) on the designated area of the UI..

![Upload Files to Create GIF](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-3-ways-to-create-gif-images-with-great-3d-gif-maker5.png)

### 03Step 3: Drag Uploaded Media to Timeline

To create a GIF withFilmora , you’ll need to first create a video. Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.

Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked \[1\] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked \[2\] in the image below) in order to create a video.

**●**Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.

**●**Add Text or audio to video.

**●**Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.

### 05Step 5: Create Video > GIF

Once you’re done editing your video, you can now convert it to a GIF.

This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.

## Part 1 Tips for Brilliant Cartoon Character Design

As a **cartoon character designer**, here are 10 tips you need to put in place to make a brilliant **cartoon character design**. They are;

**●** **Do not lose the magic**

Make sure you try not to polish all the charm from your characters. Many character designers usually begin their project with a sketch and agree that this is often where the essence of the character gets captured. Therefore, when you start working up a design, make sure you do not lose that magic.

The first thing is to decide what you are trying to communicate and then create loose sketches with flow, acting, and movement. As soon as you tighten up the drawing, some of the dynamics will automatically loosen, so it is crucial to have as much life in the early stages as possible. In addition, movement is all but impossible to add later. Thus, you need to ensure that it is in the initial sketch.

![cartoon character design tips 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cartoon-character-design-2.jpg)

**●** **Avoid reference material**

Although inspiration needs to come from somewhere, the aim is to create something original, and you shouldn't have the reference material right in front of you as you work.

Also, if you take a look at something and when you try and hazily remember it in your mind, that is when you can end up making something new, rather than making a pastiche of something.

**●** **Make research on other characters**

For guidance purposes, it can be much help when you try to deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some do not work. Also, there is no shortage of research material to be found, as illustrated characters are appearing everywhere like stickers on fruit, TV commercials, shop signs, cereal boxes, animations on mobile phones, etc. Make sure you study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and the particular thing you like about them.

**●** **Also, take a look elsewhere**

It is also a great idea to look beyond some character designs when hunting for inspiration because most times, when you begin a project, you might start with the feeling to evoke. The process usually starts with the designer taking a video of himself as a reference and capturing something of the character's posture or idea's movement.

**●** **Try not to lose sight of the original idea**

It is elementary to allow your favorite designs to influence you subconsciously. Sometimes when you look back at your initial artworks, it will bring back the feeling you had when you were creating them, and the project you are trying to develop will shift back on track.

**●** **Exaggerate**

When you exaggerate the defining features of your character design, it will help it appear larger than real life. Also, exaggerated features help viewers identify the characters' essential qualities. Exaggeration is key in cartoon caricatures and also helps emphasize certain personality traits. In addition, if your character is strong, try not to give it normal-sized bulging arms, but soup them up so that they are five times as big as they should be. Note that the technique of exaggeration can also apply to characteristics.

**●** **Decide the aim of your character design**

When creating a character design, consider your audience as character designs mainly aim at young children, typically designed around bright colors and basic shapes. Also, commissioned character designs are no less creative but are usually more restrictive. Most clients usually have specific needs but want you to do your 'thing.' Usually, you need to break down the core features and personality. For example, if the eyes are essential, you will focus the whole design around the face, making this the key element that stands out.

**●** **Make your character distinctive**

Whether you are creating a monkey, monster, or robot, you can guarantee that there will be a hundred other similar creations out there. Therefore, your character design is required to be exciting and robust in a visual sense to captivate people's attention.

**●** **Create clear silhouettes**

A silhouette is required to help you understand the character's gesture which is another good way to differentiate your character and improve its pose. This lets you see how the character 'reads' and requires you to make the gesture clearer. It answers the question of; can things be simplified? Do you have a basic understanding of character, emotions, and how the line of action works? In addition, try not to overlap everything and keep the limbs separately.

**●**   **Consider line quality**

Finally, curved and straight curved lines read by your eyes are at different speeds. The lines drawn are from which your character design is composed can go some way to describing it. Soft, thick, round, and even lines may suggest acute and approachable character, whereas sharp, uneven, scratchy lines may indicate an erratic and uneasy character.
