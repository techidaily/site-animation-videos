**Architecture Animation** is the practice of creating a 3D Animation of a structure. A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating **3D Architectural Animation** that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.

01 [What is Architectural 3D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design](#Part 2)

03 [5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

![Explore Real Estate Projects with Architecture Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation1.png)

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

![Making Changes to Architectural Plans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation8.png)

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

![Promote Your Services with Architectural Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation9.png)

## Part 3 **5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio**

If your goal is to eventually make a name for yourself in the world of **3D Animation Architecture,** then it's a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with some of the more popular 3D Animation Services and Studios (who provide the kind of service required to create **architectural animations** like that you see in **Studio Ghibli Architecture**)

**Architecture Animation** is the practice of creating a 3D Animation of a structure. A lot of animation studios offer it as part of their packages, creating **3D Architectural Animation** that you can explore to the fullest and make use of as clips for projects for your partners or share with your audience for marketing purposes.

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

![Improved Architectural Animation Software = Higher Demand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation2.png)

## Part 2 **Top 7 Benefits of 3D Animation in Architecture Design**

We answered this just now in a very broad kind of sense. However, to be truly able to explain why the demand for **3D Architectural Animation** has only continued to grow over the years, we've also included this section on the many benefits of **Architecture Animation** and how it can improve your business offerings and help you compete on more even grounds with your competitors

### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

![Making Changes to Architectural Plans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation8.png)

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

![Promote Your Services with Architectural Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation9.png)

## Part 3 **5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio**

If your goal is to eventually make a name for yourself in the world of **3D Animation Architecture,** then it's a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with some of the more popular 3D Animation Services and Studios (who provide the kind of service required to create **architectural animations** like that you see in **Studio Ghibli Architecture**)

### 01**VisEngine**

The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is "VisEngine." They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you're curious as to the look of their finished **architectural animations**, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out

### 02**Exodo Animation Studios**

"Exodo Animation Studios" is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They've had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI

### 03**Promoshin**

Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn't mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they've worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)

Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.

## Part 3 Selecting Between 2D Animation and 3D Animation?

Confused between 2D animation and 3D animation? Several factors can be considered to select between the two types of animations. Major ones are enlisted below.

**●** Target audience: For general explanation and use, 2D animations are a good choice as they are interesting, engaging, and also pocket-friendly. If the target audience is professional people that need in-depth and important information about something, 3D animations are a better choice.

**●** Availability of software: There are different software used for different types of animations. The availability of the software can also be a deciding factor for selecting between a 2D animation or 3D animation.

**●** Budget: This is another important factor to be considered. Since 3D animation requires more complex tools and procedures, creating them is expensive. So, depending on how much you are willing to spend, you can choose between the two.

## Part 4 Part Merging 2D Animation and 3D Animation

Why choose one, when both can be used? Yes, to get the best of both worlds, 2D animations can be used along with 3D animations depending on the type of the project. Both the styles can be adjusted as per the requirements and for this, good professional software is needed.

Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.

| Features/Type of Animation | 2D Animation                                                                                               | 3D Animation                                                                                               |

04 [5 Great 2D Character Animation Templates](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?

**2D animation** is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.

However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.

We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.

With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various **2D character animation** software.

In this guide, we'll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let's proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within **animation character 2D**.

## Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks

### 01Look for a real-time reference

Using a real-world reference for **2D character animation** can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.

If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.

### 02Observe real life

You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of **2D character animation** is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.

Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don't spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.

### 03Simplicity is the key

**2D character animation** is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene's realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.

### 04Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can't complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For **2D character animation**, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.

You can't master the skill of **animation character 2D** quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.

### 05Feedback is important

Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It's wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.

## Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online

Let's now look at making an illustrated **2D character animation** move on a screen.

While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.

**Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects**

### 01Step 1: Download and Install Duik

You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters' entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.

While this isn't an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you'll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from [Rainbox Laboratory.](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/)

### 02Step 2: Design Your Character

You need a moving character before you're able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.

Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character's limbs.

In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.

![draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg)

Check the character's joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.

![character animation joints](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg)

### 03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork

Now, you'll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.

So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg's segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).

![import character artwork](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg)

To import your character artwork, go to **File**, click the **Import** tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.

### 04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging

Now, the **2D character animation** is almost over by the initial rigging.

Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.

Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It's simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character's layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the **2D** **character animation**.

The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs' section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg's upper portion, where it meets the body).

![character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg)

Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs' sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.

It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.

Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the **2D character animation**, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.

### 05Step 5: Create Your Rig

Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.

You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.

The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.

Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.

### 06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character

You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character's movement. The character's legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.

Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.

Moreover, you can add 'easing” to the animation via **2D character animation After** **Effects'** **Easy Ease** tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.

It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.

![add keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg)

Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.

As you practice, you'll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic **2D animation character design** capabilities.

## Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?

**2D animation** is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.

However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.

We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.

With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various **2D character animation** software.

In this guide, we'll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let's proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within **animation character 2D**.

## Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks

### 01Look for a real-time reference

Using a real-world reference for **2D character animation** can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.

If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.

### 02Observe real life

You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of **2D character animation** is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.

Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don't spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.

### 03Simplicity is the key

**2D character animation** is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene's realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.

### 04Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can't complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For **2D character animation**, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.

You can't master the skill of **animation character 2D** quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.

### 05Feedback is important

Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It's wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.

## Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online

Let's now look at making an illustrated **2D character animation** move on a screen.

While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.

**Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects**

### 01Step 1: Download and Install Duik

You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters' entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.

While this isn't an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you'll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from [Rainbox Laboratory.](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/)

### 02Step 2: Design Your Character

You need a moving character before you're able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.

Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character's limbs.

In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.

![draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg)

Check the character's joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.

![character animation joints](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg)

### 03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork

Now, you'll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.

So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg's segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).

![import character artwork](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg)

To import your character artwork, go to **File**, click the **Import** tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.

### 04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging

Now, the **2D character animation** is almost over by the initial rigging.

Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.

Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It's simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character's layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the **2D** **character animation**.

The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs' section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg's upper portion, where it meets the body).

![character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg)

Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs' sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.

It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.

Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the **2D character animation**, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.

### 05Step 5: Create Your Rig

Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.

You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.

The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.

Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.

![create character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character

You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character's movement. The character's legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.

Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.

Moreover, you can add 'easing” to the animation via **2D character animation After** **Effects'** **Easy Ease** tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.

It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.

![add keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg)

Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.

As you practice, you'll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic **2D animation character design** capabilities.

You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of **2D character animation** is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.

Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don't spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.

### 03Simplicity is the key

**2D character animation** is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene's realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.

### 04Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can't complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For **2D character animation**, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.

You can't master the skill of **animation character 2D** quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.

### 05Feedback is important

Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It's wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.

## Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online

Let's now look at making an illustrated **2D character animation** move on a screen.

While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.

**Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects**

### 01Step 1: Download and Install Duik

You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters' entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.

While this isn't an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you'll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from [Rainbox Laboratory.](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/)

### 02Step 2: Design Your Character

You need a moving character before you're able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.

Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character's limbs.

In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.

![draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg)

Check the character's joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.

![character animation joints](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg)

### 03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork

Now, you'll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.

So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg's segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).

![import character artwork](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg)

To import your character artwork, go to **File**, click the **Import** tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.

### 04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging

Now, the **2D character animation** is almost over by the initial rigging.

Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.

Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It's simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character's layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the **2D** **character animation**.

The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs' section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg's upper portion, where it meets the body).

![character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg)

Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs' sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.

It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.

Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the **2D character animation**, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.

### 05Step 5: Create Your Rig

Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.

You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.

The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.

Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.

![create character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character

You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character's movement. The character's legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.

Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.

Moreover, you can add 'easing” to the animation via **2D character animation After** **Effects'** **Easy Ease** tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.

It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.

![add keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg)

Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.

As you practice, you'll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic **2D animation character design** capabilities.

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

![erase and shade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-16.jpg)

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.
