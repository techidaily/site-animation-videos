School's number one beauty, the red-haired Rias Gremory, deserves a spot on our list. She is the only daughter of Zeoticus Venelana Gremory and the next head of the Gremory clan. We love when she is called the Crimson-haired Ruin Princess. While she has charming features, she is very kind and compassionate even to her servants – something which makes her a fan favorite,

### 6\. Nobara Kugisaki- Jujutsu Kaisen

![nobara kugisaki](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-nobara-kugisaki.jpg)

Out of the many unique anime characters in Jujutsu Kaisen, Nobara Kugosaki is a tough girl most anime fans are drawn to. She is one of the Jujutsu manga's three primary protagonists who moved to Tokyo. Nobara isn't your typical strong lady; she is confident and outspoken about her appearance and herself as a person.

As a rebellious fighter, she has shown superhuman pain tolerance while fighting foes even larger than herself. Nobara fans love her proficiency with various curse-infused weaponry, such as the hammer and nail, straw dolls, and the rubber mallet.

### 7\. Mikasa Ackerman-Attack on Titan

![mikasa ackerman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-mikasa-ackerman.jpg)

As the favorite of many anime fans, Mikasa Ackerman had to make it to our list of the best **anime girl characters.** The lead female of Attack on Titan, Mikasa, is portrayed as one of the strongest characters, both physically and mentally.

Once a cheerful, outgoing, and innocent child living with her parents, Mikasa grows up to be quite stoic and dangerous at times. Despite the trauma of witnessing the carnage during the Survey Corps and her biological parent's brutal murder, Mikasa Ackerman retains humanity in her kind heart. But with a reserved, emotionally withdrawn personality who rarely speaks or losses her cool. Her character in the Attack on Titan series causes us to question our endurance.

### 8\. Motoko Kusanagi-Ghost in the Shell

![motoko kusanagi](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-motoko-kusanagi.jpg)

Who doesn't know this quick-witted girl from the very popular Ghost in the shell manga-anime franchise, with a characteristic cyborg body?

Motoko connects with the audience on a greater level, for she is strong, cool, intellectual, and artificial at the same time.

### 9\. Touka Kirishima-Tokyo Ghoul

![touka kirishima](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-touka-kirishima.jpg)

Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.

In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation. And as humans and ghouls come to peace, she marries Ken Kaneki and gives birth to their first daughter Ichika Kaneki.

### 10\. Tsukuyo-Gintama

![tsukuyo anime character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-tsukuyo-anime-character.jpg)

Tsukuyo from Gintama anime and manga is a fan-favorite, often known as "Courtesan of Death." She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia. And so, she grows to be a competent, highly skilled ninja currently serving as a leader of an all-female law enforcement squad—no wonder all feminist anime fans look up to her interesting personality and powerful character.

### 11\. Lucy Heartfilia- Fairy Tail

![lucy heartfilia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-lucy-heartfilia.jpg)

There are so many likable qualities about Lucy – she is fair and beautiful, responsible, with impressive magic skills, and a desire to become a world-famous author. Lucy Heartfilia leaves her home after her mother's death with an ambition for independence, something admired by the fandom.

### 12\. Yui Komori- Diabolik Lovers

![yui komori](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-yui-komori.jpg)

Yui is living with Cordelia's heart in her. When Cordelia was dying, she asked Richter to cut out and implant her heart into another human body, so he did it in the abandoned kid Yui. Later, she was adopted by a priest and vampire hunter, Seiji, and is forced to live with six vampire brothers.

When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it's not a surprise that Diabolik Lover's Yui Komori is everyone's favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty. But there's more than just beauty about Yui Komori – she is still-willed and brave, with an optimistic personality. She is seen to keep a cool head about threats and not mind any mean comments from the other vampires.

### 13\. Revy-Black Lagoon

![revy anime character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-revy-anime-character.jpg)

No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can't really relate to this complex **female anime character** until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.

### 14\. Shoko Nishimiya- A Silent Voice

![shoko nishimiya](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/14-shoko-nishimiya.jpg)

This entry has had a long-lasting impression on most anime fans because of her sweet and forgiving nature, who fakes smiles even when it's hard to. Her character is one of a kind being clinically deaf but still the leading protagonist of the A Silent Voice series. Unfortunately, she has always been an easy target for bullies, especially her classmate Shoya, who later becomes her friend due to her forgiving nature. Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.

### 15\. Esdeath- Akame ga Kill

![esdeath female anime-character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/15-esdeath-female-anime-character.jpg)

Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath's spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General's apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father's death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.

## What Makes a Female Anime Character Stand out?

A bunch of unique and exciting anime characters is released every year. While some of these turn out lovable gems, others prove long-forgotten failures. But what is it about an anime character that makes it stand out?

Everything shapes the perfect leading anime character, from their personalities to their clothes and styling to the character development. Memorable **anime girl characters** are rare, well-written protagonists with profound nature, exciting stories, and emotions that relate to anime fans.

So, which **female anime character** is your favorite?

Here comes a ferocious ghoul; one of the most talked-about female protagonists from the Tokyo Ghoul series is Touka Kirishima, aka Rabbit. While she tries not to resort to violence most of the time, sometimes she hunts with a Rabbit mask on, hence the alias.

In the past, she was a waitress at the famous coffee shop in Anteiku. With the progression of the series, Touka becomes the manager two years after the Owl Suppression Operation.

She is a blondie with a scar over her forehead that tells the tales of her loyalty to her master when he asked her to reject her identity as a woman. Orphaned as a child, Tsukuyo was raised and trained by a ruthless and deadly assassin, Jiraia.

When it comes to lovely vampire anime ladies, it's not a surprise that Diabolik Lover's Yui Komori is everyone's favorite. Her wavy platinum blonde hair and glistering sherbet pink color eyes have caught the attention of the viewers. Not to mention the pretty pink flower hair clip on the left side of her hair adds to her beauty.

### 13\. Revy-Black Lagoon

![revy anime character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-revy-anime-character.jpg)

No, we did not forget the heroine, Revy, or as you may call her Rebecca Lee from the Black Lagoon anime series. Everything about Revy is ferocious. In her mid to late twenties, Revy is a Chinese-American tan-skinned woman with a wild temperament. In the old days, she is shown as a thief and murderer who shot an unknown man as her first murder. You can't really relate to this complex **female anime character** until you dive deeper into her intriguing story and understand the verbal and physical trauma she has faced over the years. Though she is a little rude, sarcastic, and troubled, her forgetful and humorous side touches our hearts once in a while.

Despite the bullies, the pain, Shoko Nishimiya is a strong girl who cares about her family and friends but cries in silence when she is hurt.

### 15\. Esdeath- Akame ga Kill

![esdeath female anime-character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/15-esdeath-female-anime-character.jpg)

Without a doubt, Esdeath is the best dark character in the history of the darkest anime series or films. If you are an action lover like us, Esdeath's spectacular fight skills will wow you. As a high-ranking general of the Empire, her attire consists of a General's apparel with long sleeves, a blue scarf around the neck, and high-heeled boots. Soon, the Prime Minister appoints her as the leader of the Jaegers since she is stronger (emotionally and physically) than most characters. Now a manipulative and sadistic woman, Esdeath did not always lack empathy. Sadly, it was her father's death in her own arms that hardened her heart to a point she humiliated and tortured anyone she finds weaker than her.

## What Makes a Female Anime Character Stand out?

A bunch of unique and exciting anime characters is released every year. While some of these turn out lovable gems, others prove long-forgotten failures. But what is it about an anime character that makes it stand out?
