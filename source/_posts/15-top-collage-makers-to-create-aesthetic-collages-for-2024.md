Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn't be easier. A lot of the 'whiteboard animation' generators also work as **blackboard animation** generators.

In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.

03 [How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?**

**Blackboard animation** some may say is as outdated as the concept of 'blackboards' themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.

However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, **chalkboard animation** is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it's just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you're looking for — especially if you're looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)

![Traditional Blackboard with Chalk](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation1.png)

## Part 2 **How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?**

But alright, so how do you make it so that your **blackboard animation** is just as suited for the modern generation as it is for the older generation?? Well, that's easy really. You'll need images Or, rather, you'll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with **chalkboard animation**.

With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your **chalkboard animation video** and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.

![Black Blackboard and Drawing Pencils](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation2.png)

## Part 3 **How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?**

Alright, so onto actually talking about how you can go about creating a **chalkboard animation video** Take note, this is going to be an 'overview' kind of tutorial. We've also decided to choose a more 'custom' method, rather than using one of the premium **blackboard animation** generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)

### 01Step 1\. Pick Your Software

The first step in creating **chalkboard animation** is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more 'animation-specific', like After Effects. Or something more 'video-editing-specific' like Filmora.

Again, because this is meant to be more of a 'general' tutorial, we won't be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your **blackboard animation** videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project

![Filmora - Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation3.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Create a Storyboard**

Next, to make the actual **blackboard animation** creation process go smoother, it's important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create

The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don't necessarily have to draw every single frame of your **chalkboard animation** beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won't have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future

![Blackboard Animation - Storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation4.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Draw Characters**

For this step, we say 'characters' and use the word 'draw.' But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you'll need for each scene (if not each frame)

If you're not the 'drawing' type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you're really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind

![Prepare Characters for Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation5.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Put Together Project**

Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That's also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go

In the image below, we're only showing the start of a potential project. We've only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video

![Use Software to Create Blackboard Animation Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation6.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes **blackboard animation** videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you're doing it to promote your services/goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another

**●** Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn't make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals

**●** In our brief 'overview' tutorial, we expand on the subject of **blackboard animation** some more. Be warned, it's not the kind of project you should go into if you're not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.

**●** Still, there's something satisfying about a well-done **chalkboard animation video** that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.

### 03**Step 3\. Draw Characters**

For this step, we say 'characters' and use the word 'draw.' But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you'll need for each scene (if not each frame)

If you're not the 'drawing' type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you're really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind

### 04**Step 4\. Put Together Project**

Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That's also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go

In the image below, we're only showing the start of a potential project. We've only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video

Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn't be easier. A lot of the 'whiteboard animation' generators also work as **blackboard animation** generators.

In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.

## Part 1 **Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?**

**Blackboard animation** some may say is as outdated as the concept of 'blackboards' themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.

However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, **chalkboard animation** is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it's just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you're looking for — especially if you're looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)

![Traditional Blackboard with Chalk](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation1.png)

## Part 2 **How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?**

But alright, so how do you make it so that your **blackboard animation** is just as suited for the modern generation as it is for the older generation?? Well, that's easy really. You'll need images Or, rather, you'll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with **chalkboard animation**.

With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your **chalkboard animation video** and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.

## Part 3 **How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?**

Alright, so onto actually talking about how you can go about creating a **chalkboard animation video** Take note, this is going to be an 'overview' kind of tutorial. We've also decided to choose a more 'custom' method, rather than using one of the premium **blackboard animation** generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)

### 01Step 1\. Pick Your Software

The first step in creating **chalkboard animation** is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more 'animation-specific', like After Effects. Or something more 'video-editing-specific' like Filmora.

Again, because this is meant to be more of a 'general' tutorial, we won't be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your **blackboard animation** videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project

![Filmora - Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation3.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Create a Storyboard**

Next, to make the actual **blackboard animation** creation process go smoother, it's important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create

The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don't necessarily have to draw every single frame of your **chalkboard animation** beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won't have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future

We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There's a surprisingly large amount of both **caricature photo maker** apps and **online caricature maker** tools.

Today, we'll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we've even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to **make a caricature of a photo**.

#### In this article

01 [The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects](#Part 1)

02 [How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

![MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330>

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743>

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voil%C3%A0-ai-artist-cartoon-photo/id1558421405>

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

![Caricature Hyper Face Morph Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cartoon-caricature-face-camera/id1424277519>

![Cartoon Caricature Face Camera Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects9.png)

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-distortion-screw-up-your-face/id1188623179>

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Caricature is now possible in an instant with the use of a **caricature maker** app. These tools render an existing photograph with the use of filters and effects to create a **caricature sketch** worthy of any artist's skill.

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Caricature is now possible in an instant with the use of a **caricature maker** app. These tools render an existing photograph with the use of filters and effects to create a **caricature sketch** worthy of any artist's skill.

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find.

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Caricature is now possible in an instant with the use of a **caricature maker** app. These tools render an existing photograph with the use of filters and effects to create a **caricature sketch** worthy of any artist's skill.

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.
