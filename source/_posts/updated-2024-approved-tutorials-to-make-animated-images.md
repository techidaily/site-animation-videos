From the drop down menu that follows, choose the ‘Crop to Fit’ option to adjust the aspect ratio of your imported images in line with the slideshow project.

When all the images and videos have been added, proceed to arrange them in the desired order of appearance in the slideshow, followed by adjusting their screen time and play durations through any of the methods explained above.

**Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts**

The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.

Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.

![Wondershare Filmora Slideshow Creator- Adding Slide Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Top-8-tools-tell-you-how-to-make-slideshows-for-instagram-19.JPG)

Post the timeline adding of a transition, you can double click on the same to reach the ‘Transition Setting Window’, where you are allowed to customize the play duration and select its ‘Transition Mode’. Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.

**Step 5: Add Overlays and Filters for an Improvised Colour Scheme**

To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.

To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.

**Step 6: Include Motion Graphic Elements**

To supplement your slideshow with elegant motion graphics, navigate to the ‘Elements’ tab in the editor timeline. From here, you can access and choose any suitable motion graphic template from a diversity of available choices, to include within the project timeline. The step is completely optional and you should pay attention to the style of content presentation and the cause of creation of your slideshow when choosing to add these elements to the same.

**Step 7: Record Voiceovers and Create Soundtracks**

To record a voiceover for your slideshow, navigate to the ‘Media’ tab and tap the ‘Record’ dropdown menu. Click on ‘Record Voiceover’ in the list of options that appears.

****Step 4: Edit or Adjust GIF**

Before moving forward, you should take this chance to make adjustments to the media that you uploaded into your timeline There are many things that you can do at this stage so feel free to experiment

For our example, we cut down the video that we uploaded by using the 'Trim' option (which you can find by right-clicking on video media).

## Part 1 **Why GIF?**

Before we move on to the tutorials, let's do a brief account on GIF files We've also answered some of the more common questions regarding using a **GIF image maker** below for your edification

But, first: Why GIF? Well, it all comes down to what you're looking for A lot of people use GIF files to create animated icons that they can use for their accounts. Some just genuinely want to create a GIF file that they can share with their friends and families (either for a laugh or something else) GIF files are a convenient vessel for doing this because they have a lot of flexibility and are accepted by most platforms

### 01**Why Gif from My Images Are Blurry?**

One of the biggest issues people tend to have when turning an **image into GIF** is that they come out of the process with a blurry end-product. No one wants that But, how are you supposed to avoid it? Well, it all depends on the tool that you're using and your initial picture For the former, it's best to review the upload requirements of your chosen GIF maker to get a better end result. For the latter, it's best to pick a good, high-quality GIF creator for a better outcome

### 02**There Are Jaggy Strokes Around Gif?**

Another issue that you might suffer from while trying to **create GIFs from photos** is jaggy or raggedy strokes around the GIF when converted. These occur often with GIF makers that support transparency If you find these happening to you, adjust the transparency settings to get rid of the white pixel outline around your converted GIF.

## Part 2 **How to Add an Image to a GIF?**

Now it's finally time for the tutorials that we promised at the beginning of this article These tutorials will range from online to software solutions — so that you can get a clear idea of what you can expect from all these different GIF makers. To be more specific, we'll be demonstrating with an online **images to GIF converter**, how to create **animated GIF photoshop**, and how to easily turn any image **into GIF** with the **photo GIF creator**, Wondershare Filmora Video Editor.

### 01Image to GIF: How to Turn Photos into Animated GIFs

****Step 1: Go to Loading.IO**

Of course, we start off this tutorial by opening the GIF maker. In this case, since the tool is hosted online, that's as easy as opening the link that we've provided below It will take you directly to the online GIF creator.

URL: <https://loading.io/animation/icon/>

![Launch Online GIF Creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif1.png)

![Upload Photo to Turn into GIF](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif2.png)

****Step 3: Choose animation Style**

****Step 4: Adjust Settings**

This step is technically optional, as there are default settings already prepared if you have no other specifications for your image-turned GIF. But, if you want, you can adjust certain settings for a better outcome

For example, you can speed up the animation with the 'Speed' slider. Or, you can increase the number of times the GIF loops by adjusting the 'Repeat' slider. Test out a couple of settings to get the best result

![Adjust Slider Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif4.png)

![Loop Animation Forever](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-10-best-and-fast-ways-to-turn-image-into-gif12.png)

To get the correct lip-syncing for your animations, you can first try and practice by using a mirror or recording some trial videos. In these videos, you can speak and observe the jaw motion.

### 04 Use Blending

The technique of blending can also be used where the focus is on the most important shape of the mouth rather than each syllable. These shapes can then be blended and used in different ways and combinations.

### 05 Emphasize Eyes

Eyes need special focus as they can be used for expressing several emotions. Especially during the close-up shots in animations, a person looks at the eyes before the rest of the face.

### 06 Use the Apt Voice

No matter how perfectly the lip-syncing is done, it will not look good if the voice does not match the characters in your animations. So, make sure to select the voice that matches the looks and the personality of your characters.
