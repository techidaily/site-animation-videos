## Part 4 How To Make A Stop Motion Video Super Easily?

Once done with the production stage, it is time to transition to post-production. Here, your stop motion animation will get its final posture. You need to place all the images you wish to include in the video's final cut into a folder and arrange them the same way as they should appear in the video. Even though **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** provides powerful video editing tools that enable you to improve the colors in the footage you are syncing with, it is best to edit your photos via dedicated photo editing software.

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab. Moreover, you should also import all audio files you would like to use in your project before doing any actual editing. When finished, head over to the File tab, and choose the Preferences option.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04\.

You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the **Play** button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps.
