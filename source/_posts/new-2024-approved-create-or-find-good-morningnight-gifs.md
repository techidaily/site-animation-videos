## Part 1 Create Good Morning/Night GIF Images with Adobe Photoshop

If you are familiar with Adobe Photoshop or are willing to learn it, you can also use its assistance to create good morning/night GIF images. Even though the application is mostly used to edit images, it can also help you develop all kinds of funny good morning/night GIFs.

To do that, you need to work on different layers in Photoshop and then merge them as a single frame to provide a more animated appeal. Here are some basic steps that you can follow to come up with anime good night or morning GIFs.

##### Step 1 Launch Photoshop and Load Media Assets

You can start by launching Adobe Photoshop on your system and visiting its File > Scripts section to load your media files.

![adobe photoshop load media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-2.jpg)

##### Step 2 Start working on Animated GIFs in Photoshop

Now, to come up with a funny good morning/night GIF, you can go to its Menu > Layer and choose to create a new layer.

![photoshop add layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-3.jpg)

Since it is recommended to have a timeline for your media, you can go to its Window > Timeline to get a timeline view at the bottom.

![photoshop timeline view](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-4.jpg)

Afterward, you can go to the timeline at the bottom panel and choose work on frame animations to create any good morning/night animation.

![photoshop create animation frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-5.jpg)

You can now duplicate your files or adjust them on the timeline to develop an animated GIF. Afterward, you can go to its properties to create a new layer for your frames and then merge them.

![photoshop make frame from layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-6.jpg)

##### Step 3 Make Final Adjustments to your Animated GIFs

As you would have different good morning/night GIF funny animations, you can right-click on the timeline and set up their respective durations.

![photoshop set duration for frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-7.jpg)

Besides that, you can also right-click any frame and select how many times it would be repeated.

![repeat frames on photosho](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-8.jpg)

Childhood crushes and idolization of **animated characters** were very normal things! **Popular animated characters** were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!

Today, in order to reminisce a little, we'll be going through some of the more **famous animated characters**!

Although we initially promised only 15 **animated characters**, we've stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more **popular animated characters** to reminisce about! We've also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!

### 01Mickey Mouse

**Movie(s)**: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)

**First Appearance**: Steamboat Willie (1928)

**Voiced by**: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine

When it comes to admirable **animated characters**, Disney's Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune! He merited the top spot simply for that fame, even though, in all honesty, his time on the big screen had been pretty limited (with his biggest performance having been from Fantasia).

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 02Woody

**Movie(s)**: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)

**First Appearance**: Toy Story (1995)

**Voiced by**: Tom Hanks

We of course also cannot forget Toy Story's Woody in a discussion of **famous animated characters**. This cowboy toy comes equipped with a pull-string that just oozes personality (both good and bad), leading up to a very satisfying movie-watching experience as we watch him grow from the selfish toy that he had been in the beginning to the generous, and forgiving toy that he developed into by the fourth movie in the series!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 03Buzz Lightyear

**First Appearance**: Toy Story (1995)

**Voiced by**: Tim Allen

Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as **animated characters** go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear's growth from a delusional 'space-ranger-wannabe' into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 04Dory

**Movie(s)**: Finding Nemo (2003), Finding Dory (2016)

**First Appearance**: Finding Nemo (2003)

Dory was undoubtedly the underdog of the Finding Nemo franchise! This lovable fish, **Voiced by** the equally loveable Ellen DeGeneres, stole the show and earned herself her own feature film that all the animated movie lovers came to watch in 2016! Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 05Totoro

**Movie(s)**: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)

**First Appearance**: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)

**Voiced by**: Hitoshi Takagi

Speaking of cute characters, how can one forget about Totoro!

And of course, this is all things to the loveable animated character, Totoro — who is cuddly, gentle, and peaceful!

**Related Movie Clips**:

**Movie(s)**: Aladdin (1992), The Return of Jafar (1994), Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996)

If you're the type to want to **make your animated character**, taking inspiration from Robin William's Genie would surely not lead you astray! In fact, you can get started on it today, if you wanted! All you have to do is pick up a good mic and a professional video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** Pro that can help you in your quest to bring your characters to life!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 07Wall-E

**Movie(s)**: Wall-E (2008)

**First Appearance**: Cameo in Cars (2006)

**Voiced by**: Ben Burtt

Wall-E broke the box office for its underlying message regarding how we humans treat our world, but also because of its loveable characters! Who can say that they did not fall in love with Wall-E and his darling Eve? Despite his almost-mute character, he was brought to life in a way that made him very easy to love and would be remembered for years to come.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 08Donkey

**Movie(s)**: Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek 3, Shrek Forever After, a Christmas short

**First Appearance**: Shrek

**Voiced by**: Eddie Murphy

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 09Cruella de Vil

**Movie(s)**: 101 Dalmatians

**First Appearance**: 101 Dalmatians

**Voiced by**: Betty Lou Gerson

When it comes to classic villain **animated characters**, one cannot forget about the illustrious Cruella de Vil! This character was pure evil in a feminine form! Designed to be the enemy of puppy lovers everywhere all while bringing a little spice into what would have otherwise been a sweet, slice of life film.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 10Boo

**Movie(s)**: Monsters Inc.

**First Appearance**: Monsters Inc.

**Voiced by**: Mary Gibbs

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 11Mike Wasowski

**Movie(s)**: Monsters Inc

**First Appearance**: Monsters Inc

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 12Toothless

**Movie(s)**: How To Train Your Dragon, How to Train your Dragon 2

**First Appearance**: How To Train Your Dragon

**Voiced by**: N/A

A more modern, but no-less loveable **animated character** that we all know and love is Toothless from 'How to Train Your Dragon!' Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 13Chihiro

**Movie(s)**: Spirited Away (2001)

**First Appearance**: Spirited Away (2001)

**Voiced by**: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase

The story of Chihiro from 'Spirited Away' is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget!

She's a part of a long line of greatly designed and developed characters whose journey you just can't look away from.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 14Lumiere

**Movie(s)**: Beauty and the Beast (1991), The Enchanted Christmas (1997)

**First Appearance**: Beauty and the Beast (1991)

**Voiced by**: Jerry Orbach

'Beauty and the Beast' is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved **Disney Animated Characters**, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (**Voiced by** Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the 'Be Our Guest' track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast's love story.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 15Sophie

**Movie(s)**: Howl's Moving Castle (2004)

**First Appearance**: Howl's Moving Castle (2004)

**Voiced by**: Chieko Baisho; Emily Mortimer & Jean Simmons

**Movie(s)**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**First Appearance**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**Voiced by**: Eleanor Audley

Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty' also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent's LIVE action form merited a sequel.

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo

**Movie(s)**: Dumbo (1941)

**First Appearance**: Dumbo (1941)

**Voiced by**: N/A

Dumbo joins the cast of cute and cuddly characters that manage to make an impact with little to no words! His amazing animation managed to convey his entire story despite his muteness, speaking to the great talent of his animators!

**Voiced by**: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase

The story of Chihiro from 'Spirited Away' is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget!

**First Appearance**: Beauty and the Beast (1991)

**Voiced by**: Jerry Orbach

'Beauty and the Beast' is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved **Disney Animated Characters**, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (**Voiced by** Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the 'Be Our Guest' track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast's love story.

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo

**Movie(s)**: Dumbo (1941)

**Cartoon character drawing** is usually a vital aspect of any child's life who loves to watch cartoon series and can sometimes be someone's favorite thing in the world.

![how to draw cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-1.jpg)

A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child's life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.

However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing **cool cartoon drawings** that will match different audiences, both older and younger.

## Part 1 **How to Draw Cartoon Characters Step by Step**

Note that in the world we live in, Professionals were once students, and experts were once beginners. This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: "learning." Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician's assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.

Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of **cartoon character drawing** and practice some **easy, simple cartoon drawing** before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world.

![how to draw cartoons characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

Step 1:

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**Step 7:** Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

![how to draw with colour 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-6.jpg)

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

## Part 3 FAQs About Watching Anime Online

Here we summarized some FAQs you may be interested in when watching an anime online.

#### 1\. What is anime?

In Japan, anime refers to any animated cartoon, whereas outside Japan, it refers to cartoon videos made specifically in Japan. Anime is basically a hand or computer-drawn animated series. Owing to their gripping storylines, these series, as well as movies, have their separate fan base.
