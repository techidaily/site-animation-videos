## Part 1 **Is Blender best for animation?**

The answer to if the Blender is suitable for animation is yes. **Blender animation** is the best for making animations and bringing any living to animator. This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let's talk about why **Blender 3D animation software** is the best and more helpful.

Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.

There are many animation effects other than animating characters. **Blender 3D for free** has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.

Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.

Blender's animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.

Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.

## Part 2 **How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.**

This is a series for people who want to learn how to create **3D blender animation** characters from keeping a reference image. Blender's ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.

### 01Step 1: Importing

Initially, import a **Blender 3D** **animation** character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.

Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0

Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.

![Importing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/blender-3d-animation-2.jpg)

### 02Step 2: Add Keyframes

There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.

Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet 'G' on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.

Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.

### 03Step 3: Get Reference Materials

It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let's discuss how to add it.

Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select "Image" and then choose the "Background." Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.

Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.

### 04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound

This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let's see how to add it.

Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.

There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.

Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let's discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.

Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the "Sound." Now select the sound that you wish to add.

Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between "No Sync" to "AV Sync" in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.

### 05Step 5: Rendering

Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.

Initially, click on "scene" and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as "WebM" and video Codec as "WEBM/VP9\. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to "Vorbis." Choose output quality and speed.

After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select "Render Animation" in **Blender Animation**.

Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using **Blender 3D animation software**. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the **Blender 3D mouse**.

## Part 1 **Is Blender best for animation?**

The answer to if the Blender is suitable for animation is yes. **Blender animation** is the best for making animations and bringing any living to animator. This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let's talk about why **Blender 3D animation software** is the best and more helpful.

Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.

There are many animation effects other than animating characters. **Blender 3D for free** has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.

Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.

Blender's animation tools are making motion graphics possible by advancing the features than it was four years ago.

Nowadays, many people are using Blender to do professional works, including freelancers, small studios, and even game developers.

## Part 2 **How to Create 3D Animated Characters with Blender in 15 Minutes.**

This is a series for people who want to learn how to create **3D blender animation** characters from keeping a reference image. Blender's ringing tools will be more helpful for this process.

### 01Step 1: Importing

Initially, import a **Blender 3D** **animation** character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.

Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0

Download the character file from the cloud to any destination folder on the computer. Open the Blender and place the cursor on the origin point on the screen. Later select import present in the File menu and choose the file format. And now, allow the Python script to run for the selected character folder.

![Importing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/blender-3d-animation-2.jpg)

### 02Step 2: Add Keyframes

There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.

Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet 'G' on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.

Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.

### 03Step 3: Get Reference Materials

It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let's discuss how to add it.

Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select "Image" and then choose the "Background." Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.

Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.

### 04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound

This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let's see how to add it.

Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.

There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.

Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let's discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.

Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the "Sound." Now select the sound that you wish to add.

Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between "No Sync" to "AV Sync" in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.

### 05Step 5: Rendering

Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.

Initially, click on "scene" and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as "WebM" and video Codec as "WEBM/VP9\. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to "Vorbis." Choose output quality and speed.

After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select "Render Animation" in **Blender Animation**.

Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using **Blender 3D animation software**. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the **Blender 3D mouse**.

The best part about cartoons is that there's something for everyone. There are **iconic cartoon characters** that are humorous, cute, and cool.

Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

**Created:** 1941  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** William Hanna and various other voices

The series, founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, is perhaps most known for Metro-Goldwyn-161 Mayer's theatrical short films.

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

![charlie brown and snoopy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-6.jpg)

**Created:** 1950  
**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz  
**Voice:** Bill Melendez, Peter Robbins and other.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy came to life through a few TV specials and later series, even though not all of the characters made it to television. Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them. These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

![Scooby doo and shaggy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-8.png)

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

![winnie the pooh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-9.jpg)

**Created:** 1926  
**Creators:** A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard  
**Voice:** Sterling Holloway. Hal Smith. Jim Cummings

The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.

Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children's books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie's friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.

### 10Pinky & the Brain

![pinky and the brain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-10.jpg)

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![powerpuff girls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-11.jpg)

**Created:** 1998  
**Creator:** Craig McCracken  
**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** Cartoons give valuable lessons about life. People of all ages can benefit from these life lessons. While comics typically target children, this does not rule out the possibility that adults will like them. There is a slew of animated sitcoms aimed squarely at adults! This means that individuals of all ages can enjoy and love cartoons.

**●** Thus, we listed the **most iconic cartoon characters** that made your childhood more exciting. So, enjoy your choice of **iconic cartoon characters** and have fun.

These two are from the well-known Peanuts cartoon series. They are famous children's characters who are appreciated by many.

### 07Bugs Bunny (Looney Tunes)

![bugs bunny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-7.jpg)

**Created:** 1940  
**Creators:** Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery  
**Voices:** Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman and other voices

The most fabulous cat cartoon in history is a rabbit, alternatively, a hare. This little taxonomic distinction went unmentioned in numerous shenanigans. Regardless of whether the rabbit was hunting with Elmer Fudd's shotgun, Yosemite Samantha's pistols, or Marvin Martian's ACME Disintegration Gun, he maintained an enviable insouciance. The iconic visage of Warner Bros. had one flaw: terrible direction sense, particularly while digging across New Mexico.

Bugs Bunny is a late-thirties animated cartoon character created by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Mel Blanc provided his voice for him, and he has acted in several short films and television series. Many children were enthralled by the show, while the characters and stories fascinated others.

### 08Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers

**Created:** 1969  
**Creators:** Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  
**Voices:** Don Messick, Casey Kasem and a variety of others

Scooby-Doo and Shaggy's narrative has been a popular one for a long time. They have similar personalities and chemistry, as well as the same interests. They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

### 09Winnie the Pooh

![winnie the pooh](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-9.jpg)

**Created:** 1926  
**Creators:** A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard  
**Voice:** Sterling Holloway. Hal Smith. Jim Cummings

The Disney adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh were as famous as his books. Winnie-the-Pooh was famous for his lovely temperament and generous heart who also admitted to have a sweet tooth.

Winnie-the-Pooh, an anthropomorphic teddy bear, is one of the most well-known children's books. A. Milne wrote the book, and E. H. Shepard illustrated it. Winnie's friendship with Eeyore, Christopher Robin, Kanga, Rabbit, Piglet, Roo, Owl, and Tigger is depicted in the story.

### 10Pinky & the Brain

![pinky and the brain](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-10.jpg)

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![powerpuff girls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-11.jpg)

**Created:** 1998  
**Creator:** Craig McCracken  
**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation. The eventual lesson was that working together is the most robust play, regardless of who you identified with the most.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

The best part about cartoons is that there's something for everyone. There are **iconic cartoon characters** that are humorous, cute, and cool.

Since Paste first published this list a decade ago, a lot has changed in the world of cartoons. New episodes of The Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, and SpongeBob Squarepants get released regularly, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have spawned new and exciting animated characters and settings while streaming services have enabled even more creators to produce the animated shows they want.

We thought to update our list of the 12 most **iconic cartoon characters** of all time, considering the cultural influence, relatability, and significance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, and other creatures had within the sphere of animation in 2020\. Many of these characters have gone beyond their cartoon origins into other media. Still, for this list, we'll only look at them as they appear in cartoons, whether they're from the program itself or related comics and books.

### 01Fred Flintstone

![fred flintstone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-1.png)

**Created:** 1960  
**Creators:** William Hanna, Joseph Barbera  
**Voices:** Jeff Bergman and Alan Reed, as well as a variety of others

Fred, the patriarch of his modern-day stone-age clan, was an outspoken supporter of cartoons. The original series was one of the most contentious shows on television in the 1960s, despite its benign appearance (the Flintstones are better recognized for their cereal and vitamin advertising).

Fred Flintstone, the **iconic cartoon character**, is not the best-drawn cartoon character ever. He is pleasant and faithful to his wife, Wilma, despite not being a terrific boxer. The character carries a lump of granite on his shoulders and shows no fear of jeopardizing his marriage and children. He's still a hominid, a caveman with extraordinary strength and agility.

### 02Mickey Mouse

![mickey mouse](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-2.jpg)

**Created:** 1928  
**Creators:** Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks  
**Voices:** Walt Disney, BretIwan, and other voices

Mickey Mouse, the Disney mascot, is easy to overlook. Without the joys of an adventurous, passionate mouse, there might not be a Disney kingdom. In 2024, nearly a century after Disney's legendary Disney short "Steamboat Willie," the public domain will glimpse the mouse.

Walt Disney initially produced the **most iconic cartoon character** Mickey Mouse in 1928\. His unique red shorts and white gloves have helped him become one of the most well-known fictional characters in the world. He usually wears a white glove and a white cap, and his enormous, yellow shoes are a common sight. Mickey also sports a pair of white gloves and his white gloves and shorts. He also wears a giant red bow and his clothes, which makes him a versatile character.

### 03SpongeBob Squarepants

![spongebob squarepant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-3.jpg)

**Created:** 1999  
**Creator:** Stephen Hillenburg  
**Voice by** Tom Kenny  
  
Although Sponge's nautical nonsense was probably not to most parents' liking, Tom Kenny's renowned chuckle has become ingrained in viewers' brains all across the world after two decades of programming.

For almost 30 years, the SpongeBob Squarepants series has been a hit. It's a cartoon about Patrick, a yellow sea sponge which is enthusiastic about life. He works as a chef at the Krusty Krab and lives in a pineapple house. Patrick, who is also his best friend, is his best friend.

The characters are likable and harmless in general, while some of the songs in the show deal with contentious topics, many based on actual events. The show has been chastised for portraying kids as unpleasant, obnoxious, and even defiant and using many caustic languages. While the show is often entertaining, its messages can be contentious.

SpongeBob is a young adult who lives independently and works full-time despite his immaturity.

### 04Tom and Jerry

![tom and jerry](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-4.jpg)

Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse, the **iconic cartoon characters** star in the original shorts. They don't always get along, but they're usually delighted with each other and often laugh at their misfortunes. Each short features the two attempting to catch the other. This is a desperate attempt to make the other person unhappy, but it rarely works.

Tom and Jerry were minor characters in the early years of the show. There were a few distinctions between them and the human characters in the film. The first one focused more on the mouse than the human cast, but the second was more centered on the human.

### 05Homer Simpson

![homer simpson](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-5.jpg)

**Created:** 1987  
**Creator:** Matt Groening  
**Voice:** Dan Castellaneta

The Simpsons' first two seasons centered on Bart. But it was genuinely stunning as the show became more Homer-centric. He is the average man at his most sluggish, hungry, dumb, intoxicated, and idiotic. Thanks to his tremendous heart, he is still the hero, hidden beneath all the doughnuts.

Homer is a talented pianist in addition to expressing his love for Marge. He can play the guitar and keyboard, and his barbershop music has garnered him a Grammy. His most remarkable musical gift is his powerful operatic voice, which he uses in his band, Babysitter Bandit. His singing voice has won him fans worldwide, and he has played in hundreds of bands.

### 06Charlie Brown and Snoopy (Peanuts)

**Creator:** Charles M. Schulz

Snoopy's Red Baron fantasies and friendship with Woodstock were popular with children. They were also fans of Lucy's crush. Charlie was well-liked by the older crowd. Charlie Brown, the hapless Charlie Brown, elicits as much sympathy as any animated character. We pull for him even though we know it will all be for naught.

Charlie Brown and Snoopy are part of the Peanuts Gang, an iconic group of cartoon characters. You've undoubtedly seen these two cartoon heroes previously if you haven't heard of them.

They are close friends and have a passion for numerous types of food. They are mostly eating and lounging around, screaming in panic when presented with something frightening. They are the easiest to fall in love with. Despite all Scooby-countless Doo's incarnations, this man-dog pair remains timeless.

Norville "Shaggy" Rogers is a fictitious character in the Scooby-Doo series. He is well known as the cowardly slacker with whom Scooby-Doo is constantly conversing. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy are the two primary characters in Mystery Incorporated. They both came from the same puppy farm.

**Created:** 1995  
**Creator:** Tom Ruegger  
**Voices:** Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche

While many **iconic cartoon characters** have desired to be rulers of the world, none could ever envision being a benign tyrant like The Brain. Pinky, The Brain's not-so-reliable companion, may give him headaches, but his zeal is contagious, and his loyalty makes him easy to love.

### 11Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)

![powerpuff girls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-11.jpg)

**Created:** 1998  
**Creator:** Craig McCracken  
**Voices:** Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others

The Powerpuff Girls, the i**conic female cartoon characters** and the ideal vanguard of "you can be pretty and yet kick-ass," emerged on the 90s cartoon landscape eager to inspire and amuse a generation.

### 12Finn the Human and Jake the Dog (Adventure Time)

![finn and jake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-12.jpg)

**Created:** 2010  
**Creator:** Pendleton Ward  
**Voices:** Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio

This dynamic team, our two brave protagonists from the Land of Ooo, whose humor, sadness, loyalty, and bravery catapulted this fantastic, strange, emotionally deep series to must-see status for viewers of all ages, are impossible to ignore.

### 13BoJack Horseman

![bojack horseman](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-13.jpg)

**Created:** 2014  
**Creator:** Raphael Bob-Waksberg  
**Voice:** Will Arnett

The redemption arc of Will Arnett's anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse is one of the most nuanced and profoundly felt of any TV character. Even when he didn't love himself, we could love him because he was damaged and created damage wherever he went. Never has a cartoon covered such complex and challenging subjects with such finesse. It was an added advantage that it was continuously funny, and at the center of it all was a washed-up '90s sitcom actor dealing in the aftermath of his success.

### 14Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender)

![zuko](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-14.jpg)

**Created:** 2005  
**Creators:** Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko  
**Voice:** Dante Basco

That's right: Zuko, not Aang! Zuko does not appear to be the same character in the first and end episodes. The former is a haughty prince with a ponytail who can't seem to keep his fury and angst in check. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent figure, embracing his uncle and pleading for forgiveness with tears in his eyes. However, when viewed in order, the transition between the two is seamless. Zuko's narrative is tragic yet uplifting, shaped by both hate and love, making him one of the best characters in animation, if not all of television.15.Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)

![ninja turtles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/iconic%20cartoon%20characters-15.jpg)

### 15Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

**Created:** 1984  
**Creators:** Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird  
**Voices:** Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others

For this list, we'll concentrate on the original team, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet tastefully named after some of history's finest painters who became legendary for 90s youth. It's impossible to choose the "best" **iconic cartoon character** in this soap because it depends on personal preference. They are, nonetheless, indispensable to pop culture history in all of their manifestations (even as a peak of "the show is for the toy").

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**Claymation** sculptures originate from blobs of clay. Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. **Clay animation** not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.

**Clay animation** also uses stop- motion animation. It includes capturing minute movements and of models to make it look like the characters is acting on their own.

04 [8 Famous Claymation Movies in 2022](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How Does Clay Animation Work?

**Claymation** sculptures originate from blobs of clay. Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. **Clay animation** not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.

**Clay animation** also uses stop- motion animation. It includes capturing minute movements and of models to make it look like the characters is acting on their own. In stop motion animation, animators typically shoot at fps or fps. Though some claymators prefer to capture it at half the rate, fps or fps whereas fps is frame per second these captured still images are edited then converted into a video or film using stop motion software.

In recent times use of editing software and developed cameras has made the shooting process easier. Also, armatures clay models have eased the process of creating sculptures. Though, time is still a great deal while making clay animation.

## Part 2 What Are Some Famous Clay Animation Characters?

**●** **Wallace:** The character was born during the 80’s, back when stop motion was relatively unheard of. Wallace is the star of the franchise featuring Wallace and Gromit. The idea of this dynamic duo took about seven years to turn into a full scale television show. It went to becoming an Oscar winning work of art.

**●** **Victor Van Dort (Corpse Bride):** The persona of a handsome man in his prime. Short and messy brown vest over a slim structure with big brown eyes. The protagonist of the corpse bride, Victor is a character in conflict stuck within an epic love triangle involving the dead. This amazing dark satire brings out the best in clay animation with precise movements and amazing music.

**●** **Rocky (Chicken Run):** Mel Gibson went out on a foot with Rocky, though he is known for the same. Rocky is the second character with prominence in the film. The plot is about chickens attempting to escape their inevitable demise. Rocky crash lands in the coop pretending to have figured out how to fly.

**●** **Coraline:** Not your everyday story about an eleven year old. Coraline Jones continues to haunt/impact us all even today and has a strong cult backing. It was initially meant to be live action but was later shifted to Claymation which took over four years to make.

**●** **Shaun the Sheep:** Shaun is a sheep (obviously) who goes on world adventures. The movies was featured as the TV spin off. The character was meant to appeal to both children and family. The entire movie was dependant on movement and expressions rather than dialogue making Claymation the perfect medium to bring out the character.

## Part 3 How Many Changes Does a Clay Animation Movie Require?

It is difficult to say what is the exact time taken by a Claymation production as all stop motion movies are unique and require a considerable amount of time to make.

An estimate made by Fords depicted that that it took a single two minute footage of ‘Boxtrolls’ a week to make. The total running time ended at 1 hour minutes.
