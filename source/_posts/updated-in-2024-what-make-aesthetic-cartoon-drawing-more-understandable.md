## Part 1 Create Good Morning/Night GIF Images with Adobe Photoshop

If you are familiar with Adobe Photoshop or are willing to learn it, you can also use its assistance to create good morning/night GIF images. Even though the application is mostly used to edit images, it can also help you develop all kinds of funny good morning/night GIFs.

To do that, you need to work on different layers in Photoshop and then merge them as a single frame to provide a more animated appeal. Here are some basic steps that you can follow to come up with anime good night or morning GIFs.

##### Step 1 Launch Photoshop and Load Media Assets

You can start by launching Adobe Photoshop on your system and visiting its File > Scripts section to load your media files.

![adobe photoshop load media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-2.jpg)

##### Step 2 Start working on Animated GIFs in Photoshop

Now, to come up with a funny good morning/night GIF, you can go to its Menu > Layer and choose to create a new layer.

![photoshop add layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-3.jpg)

Since it is recommended to have a timeline for your media, you can go to its Window > Timeline to get a timeline view at the bottom.

![photoshop timeline view](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-4.jpg)

Afterward, you can go to the timeline at the bottom panel and choose work on frame animations to create any good morning/night animation.

![photoshop create animation frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-5.jpg)

You can now duplicate your files or adjust them on the timeline to develop an animated GIF. Afterward, you can go to its properties to create a new layer for your frames and then merge them.

![photoshop make frame from layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-6.jpg)

##### Step 3 Make Final Adjustments to your Animated GIFs

As you would have different good morning/night GIF funny animations, you can right-click on the timeline and set up their respective durations.

![photoshop set duration for frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-7.jpg)

Besides that, you can also right-click any frame and select how many times it would be repeated.

![repeat frames on photosho](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-8.jpg)

A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

So, after spending a much time on the internet, I've found five websites that can assist you in doing the same.

02 [Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?](#Part 2)

03 [The Best 8 Places for High-Quality Royalty Free Gifs (Paid and Free)](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is GIFs Royalty Free?

There is no legal method to licensing the usage of GIFs for business purposes. Given the preceding, commercial companies' use of GIFs remains a bit of a grey area.

The following are some excellent general guidelines to follow for **royalty-free GIFs**:

**●** Avoid using GIFs in a way that can irritate the copyright holder. In most cases, you can determine fair use by context rather than content. A reasonable rule of thumb is to put yourself in the position of the copyright owner and ask yourself, "Would I disprove this to the point of commencing litigation?"

**●** Provide acknowledgment to the original owner where GIFs are "stolen" from known copyright content (e.g., Credit: Universal Studios)

**●** If in doubt, stay away from GIFs derived from extremely litigious sources, and search out alternatives (or develop your own!)

## Part 2 **Are GIFs on Giphy Free to Use?**

All property rights in the Services are owned and retained by Giphy and their licensors, and hence these are not **copyright-free GIFs.** However, Giphy grants users a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use Gifs on Giphy, subject to these Terms.
