Good animes take you to a different world where you forget about the stress and tensions of real life and have fun. Choosing an anime for Binge watching is very different than watching any anime on a regular day. As you are planning to spend a lot of time, you must be careful to choose among the best animes shows available.

You can record and share your favorite anime shows with your friends very easily with Filmora. While recording through Filmore video quality nor audio quality is lost and hence you enjoy the show to the fullest. Choose one of the shows we have mentioned for binge-watching and enjoy.

Afterward, you should go and launch Filmora, do a new project and add the folder to Filmora's Media tab.

Once the option pops up on the screen, hit the Edit tab to set the max duration of a image in a video you're making.

The value you insert into the **Photo** **Duration** box is based upon the number of frames your video contains. Filmora doesn't let you minimize a project's frame rate below 23.97fps. Thus, if you want your animation to have frames per second, you need to set the value of the Photo Duration to 00:00:04\.

You can then add your media assets to the timeline, hit the **Play** button to preview the results, and export the video from Filmora if you like the results.
