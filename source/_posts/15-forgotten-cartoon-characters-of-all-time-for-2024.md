Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.

It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.

## Part 1 Does Adobe Have 3D Animation Software?

You'll be able to create a range of animation styles using After Effects CC once you grasp the basic concepts. This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.

Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.

Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.

This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although **Adobe 3D animation** can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.

This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.

It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.

### 01How is After Effects used?

The primary uses of After Effects categorize into three sections:

**Effects**,

**Animation**, and

**Compositing.**

The kind of animation for which After Effects is widely used is Motion Graphics, which includes making the motion of traditionally static objects such as text, logos, and other graphic elements.

Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.

It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.

### 02Who uses After Effects?

The After Effects is valuable to animators, visual artists, advertising agencies, video editors, video artists, video producers, social media professionals, motion graphics designers, UX professionals, etc. Gaining proficiency in After Effects comes in-depth from training, tutorials, and other hands-on use courses.

## Part 3 How to Quickly Make Adobe 3D Animation with Adobe Stock 3D Assets?

For this example, we're taking a coffee mug and creating a scenario of emitting particles around the mug via step by step guide as follows. However, the tutorial will be quick, as the subtitle suggests, without wasting much of your time.

### 01Step 1: Download model

Go to Adobe Stock and download your 3D model to proceed with. We'll use the same model for our entire scene. Also, make sure that the model has an excellent volume to it.

![download 3d model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-create-adobe-3d-animation-06.jpg)

Now, the cup is needed to enter the screen of your 3D software, as shown below.

### 02Step 2: Fill Up The Composition

Then, try to fill up the composition. Thus, the whole animation or the main subject will be this 3D model we've just downloaded.

![fill 3d model composition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-create-adobe-3d-animation-07.jpg)

Now, we'll apply primary material to the model that all comes with downloading the model from the Adobe Stock Assets.

### 03Step 3: Set Up Animation

Then, you need to set up animation from that one package of 3D files. We'll have the particles emit out from the coffee mug, and they will be the spherical particles. These particles will drive the entire animation.

![set animation 3d model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-create-adobe-3d-animation-08.jpg)

Now, you're all done with the primary 3D animation, as shown below!

![3d model animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-create-adobe-3d-animation-09.jpg)

Since it's the basic animation, you can play with the colors, masks, and other selections afterward for final rendering.
