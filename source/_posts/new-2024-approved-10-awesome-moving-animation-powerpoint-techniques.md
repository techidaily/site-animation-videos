PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

![Company Presentation PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques1.png)

### 02[**Move Animated PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/move-animated-powerpoint-template-AY6RG6D)

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

![Move Animated PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques2.png)

### 03[**40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint**](https://elements.envato.com/40-animated-conceptual-slides-for-powerpoint-QAANXAP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3OxV0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

Again, we have another modern and minimalistic kind of PowerPoint template with ‘40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint.’ It comes with 40 modern slides, all of which come fully animated are easy enough to customize with your own branding or content.

![40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques3.png)

### 04[**UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)**](https://elements.envato.com/unigraph-animated-creative-template-pptx-8V8DBFR?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O220U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

![UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques4.png)

### 05[**Graph & Charts PowerPoint Presentation**](https://elements.envato.com/graph-charts-powerpoint-presentation-QU6MKBV?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2UIU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

![Graphs & Charts PowerPoint Presentation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques5.png)

### 06[**Laststyle - PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/laststyle-powerpoint-template-2BGADZ7?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2X0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

This next PowerPoint template is most suited for businesses looking to promote their products. The creator of the template has provided five different colored versions of the template, each with 30 unique slides that were carefully sectioned with suitable animations.

![Laststyle - PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques6.png)

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

![Add Animation - Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques21.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

![Add Animation - Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques21.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

PowerPoints can be quite dull without anything to spice it up. So, this question is more than 100% warranted. Fortunately, we were able to pull together a tutorial on creating **moving animation PowerPoint** presentations.

Complete with some templates that you can start off with (if you’d prefer to make it as simple as possible for yourself.)

## Part 1 **6 Animated PowerPoint Templates with Interactive Features**

The default people tend to-go-to when it comes to presentations are videos. As they tend to be more engaging on their own. For that, you’ll see people gravitating towards software like Filmora, which can create beautiful, eye-catching presentations that you can easily and quickly share. Not just to an immediate audience, but also on social media and the like.

However, of course, sometimes a personal touch is important in a presentation — important to have a ‘voice’ attached to the image on the screen. But just because this is the case, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t go all out on your presentation. Hence, why **moving animation PowerPoint** templates are such a big deal:

### 01[**Company Presentation PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/company-presentation-powerpoint-template-NEKX8KP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O0yoU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For the first of the **Moving Animation PowerPoint** templates that we have to introduce, we chose the ‘Company Presentation PowerPoint Template.’ As you can perhaps guess from the name, it’s a very professional template. It comes with a total of 500 sample slides that you can choose from (50 of which are unique), and it’s set up with professional animations that can spice up your presentation without making it look gaudy or over-the-top.

![Company Presentation PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques1.png)

### 02[**Move Animated PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/move-animated-powerpoint-template-AY6RG6D)

Next is the modern, minimalistic template called "Move Animated." This one is a lot more versatile, with every single one of the 144 unique slides available suitably animated. The best part of it is definitely the easy way in which it can be used. With the modern, minimalistic style, it’s easy enough to remove the presets and replace them with suitable company or product images to promote your content, idea, or project.

![Move Animated PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques2.png)

### 03[**40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint**](https://elements.envato.com/40-animated-conceptual-slides-for-powerpoint-QAANXAP?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3OxV0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

Again, we have another modern and minimalistic kind of PowerPoint template with ‘40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint.’ It comes with 40 modern slides, all of which come fully animated are easy enough to customize with your own branding or content.

![40 Animated Conceptual Slides for PowerPoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques3.png)

### 04[**UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)**](https://elements.envato.com/unigraph-animated-creative-template-pptx-8V8DBFR?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O220U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For a bit more fun, our next template is "UNIGRAPH." This still definitely fits the description ‘minimalistic’ but the pop of color and effects that it brings to the table gives it a different kind of vibe from all the others. No less professional, but certainly more fun. Of course, most importantly, perhaps, is the fact that each slide is smoothly animated.

![UNIGRAPH - Animated & Creative Template (PPTX)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques4.png)

### 05[**Graph & Charts PowerPoint Presentation**](https://elements.envato.com/graph-charts-powerpoint-presentation-QU6MKBV?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2UIU0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

For this next one, we introduce a template set called "Graphs & Charts" for those who may want to present their products, projects, ideas, etc. in the shape of graphs and charts. It’s perfect for professionals, certainly. Especially with its clean look, brightened only by occasional pops of color that can be seen from the graphs and charts that it comes with.

![Graphs & Charts PowerPoint Presentation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques5.png)

### 06[**Laststyle - PowerPoint Template**](https://elements.envato.com/laststyle-powerpoint-template-2BGADZ7?irgwc=1&clickid=xBVW5T15txyIUI9TSOUTrTrPUkG3O2X0U0V6140&iradid=298927&utm%5Fcampaign=elements%5Faf%5F493214&iradtype=ONLINE%5FTRACKING%5FLINK&irmptype=mediapartner&utm%5Fmedium=affiliate&utm%5Fsource=impact%5Fradius&mp=Theme%20Junkie)

This next PowerPoint template is most suited for businesses looking to promote their products. The creator of the template has provided five different colored versions of the template, each with 30 unique slides that were carefully sectioned with suitable animations.

![Laststyle - PowerPoint Template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques6.png)

## Part 2 **How to Create a Moving Animation in PowerPoint**

Now we come to the point of the article where we speak directly to those who may want to experiment more by personally creating a **moving animation PowerPoint**. For this example, we’ll be teaching you how to create a **path animation PowerPoint** with the available tools that the software offers under ‘Animation.’ Stick around if you want to learn more.

### 01**Step 1\. Open Project.**

First things first, of course. Start a new project. When you’ve started, move on to the **Animation** tab (which we’ve pointed out in the image below.)

![Start Project - Begin Animating](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques7.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Add Animation.**

Then, make sure to select the object or model that you want to animate (in this case, we’ve inserted a 2D model of a businessman), and then click the ‘Add Animation’ button (shown in the image below.)

![Add Animation to Model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques8.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Choose Animation.**

Under ‘Add Animation’ you’ll find several different options for animations that you can choose from. Of course, since our goal is to create a **PowerPoint Motion Path Animation**, we have selected one of the ‘Motion Path’ options.

![Add ‘Motion Path Animation’](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques9.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Choose Motion Path Animation**

In order to make **motion animation in PowerPoint**, you must select one of the offered ‘Motion Paths’ (i.e., Bounce, Line, Arcs, etc.) and then use the motion path tool that appears to control the direction you wish to make your character move.

In this example, we chose the ‘Lines’ motion path (1) and then used the line tool to create a path for our businessman model. To walk from the right side of the screen towards the left.

![Create Motion Path](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques10.png)

### 05**Step 5\. Adjust Animation.**

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

![Adjust Motion Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques11.png)

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

With **path animation PowerPoint** complete, you can adjust as needed with the tools provided. For example, you can have the character start moving as soon as the slide opens, or wait until a minute has passed, you can extend the animation by changing duration, etc.

## Part 3 **10 Moving Animation PowerPoint Techniques**

For this last step, we break down some important **PowerPoint 3D Animation** need-to-knows. Including the specifics provided by each of the options made available to you and why it’s important to explore every single one to create better and more professional-looking presentations.

### 01**Transitions**

When it comes to PowerPoint presentations, most people are no doubt the most familiar with ‘Transitions’ when talking in terms of adding animation into a presentation. This one decides whether you want to shift from one slide to another smoothly, or if you want the previous slide to break into splinters, or rotate into the next slide, and so on and so forth. It’s an ‘in-between’ animation that signals where one ends and the other begins.

![PowerPoint Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques12.png)

### 02**Animations**

Now, for the ‘Animations’ tab, we focus on animations that occur in the slide (not in-between like transitions). This can include a wide array of things. Whether it be characters moving (like shown in the tutorial we provided), text boxes appearing and disappearing in short order, images bouncing into view in dramatic fashion, and so on and so forth. There’s lots of potential here.

![PowerPoint Animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques13.png)

### 03**Animation - Start**

We mentioned this previously in the tutorial, but PowerPoint (which does not offer the more advanced 3D customization options), does still give you the freedom to choose how you want certain animations to work.

In the case of the ‘Animations-Start’ option, the goal is to decide when an animation starts playing. Do you want it to start after a click? Or maybe you want it to start up immediately? Whatever the case may be, this function will let you choose the specifics.

![Animation - Start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques14.png)

### 04**4\. Animation - Duration**

Next, we decide how long you want the animation to last. For example, if you chose to add a **PowerPoint 3D rotation animation** into a character, how long do you want it to spin before it settles into place? Perhaps only a second? Perhaps more? Whatever you chose, this is the option that will let you finalize that.

![Animation - Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques15.png)

### 05**Animation - Delay**

This one is self-explanatory as well. But suffice to say, the ‘Delay’ option is for deciding how much an animation is delayed before starting. For example, if you chose to start it ‘On Click’ you can increase the delay to keep it from playing immediately on click.

![Animation - Delay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques16.png)

### 06**Break Up Presentation into Sections**

A lot of PowerPoint templates, you’ll find, are naturally broken into sections. This is because it is easier to consume it in that way. It’s also a good signal to your audience as to what point of the presentation you are on. Are you in the beginning? The middle? Near the end? Etc. In this case, the best option for showing it is transitions that separate the sections from one another.

![Separate into Sections with Transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques17.png)

### 07**Add Animation - Entrance**

As promised earlier, we’ll be going through each type of animation is available under the ‘Add Animation’ option. The first is "Entrance" animations. This one is pretty easy to guess. It makes up a variety of animations that serve as its entrance animation. Here are some examples:

**●** Appear: To have objects appear without any other effect.

**●** Fade: To have objects fade into view.

**●** Bounce: To have objects bounce into view.

**●** Swivel: To have objects swivel into view.

![Add Animation - Entrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques18.png)

### 08**Add Animation - Emphasis**

This next animation style is to give emphasis to an already-present object. For example, at a click, you can have a text box ‘Pulse’ and become the center of attention. You can change ‘Object Color’ to make it stand out. And so on.

![Add Animation - Emphasis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques19.png)

### 09**9\. Add Animation - Exit**

Opposite of the ‘Entrance’ animations are the ‘Exit’ animations. You’ll notice that the style of animations is the same here. The only difference is that the animations occur to exit the project out of the presentation. For example, an image exiting to reveal text. Or text flying out to be replaced with more text, etc.

![Add Animation - Exit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-awesome-moving-animation-powerpoint-techniques20.png)

### 10**Add Animation - Motion Path**

We’ve already mentioned the **PowerPoint Motion Path animation** style previously, but just to reiterate some things, this is the most customizable animation feature on PowerPoint. One that allows you to move objects across the slide in whatever way you wish. In our example, we created a motion path animation that took the character from the center of the screen to the left of the screen.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** While videos are the most popular way to share information, there are some presentations that require a heavier guiding hand.

**●** In these situations, a PowerPoint presentation, carefully animated, can serve in place of an edited video.

**●** There are templates available that you can take advantage of if you’d prefer to start with something to work from. We introduced some in this article that we think were particularly notable.

**●** But, of course, more careful personalization is sometimes necessary. In that case, we hope that you find our tutorial and our list of PowerPoint techniques helpful.

## Part 1: Preparation

#### 1\. Script is the Essence

If you wish to understand the nuances of how to make an animation, the first step you should know is scripting.

Playing with the words in your mind and weaving them on paper makes a big difference. So, penning a story helps you to recognize the loopholes, the pace, and the character development in your story.

The script gives a person an idea of where your story is based, how does it look or at which time of the day are you talking about, who is talking to whom, and most importantly, the dialogues, what are your story characters say to one another. The script is the essence of creating animation and without it, you cannot resume the process of animation.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/writer-script-periscope.JPG)

#### 2\. Storyboarding

What is storyboarding? It is a sequence of images or pre-visualization of movie shots to understand how exactly the story will unveil, the feel, the look, the camera angles, everything is described like a flowchart.

Storyboarding can be of various types. It may be colorful, it may just an outline, or black and white or something with complete detail. A storyboard must give a complete and close image of what the movie would look like.

The images must be captioned, the movement of the camera must be shown with arrows, and the object and characters must be differentiated from the background with colors.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboard.JPG)

#### 3\. Voiceover

If you want to make your animation more vivid and interesting, remember to add voiceover. Would you like to see an animated movie without a voice? It is a vital part of any movie recording.

When you ask how to make an animation, you also need to know how to record a voiceover. The animation is influenced by voice performance for focus and timing of a scene. The animated scene and the voiceover must be in sync perfectly in order to retain the attention of the viewers.

In the earlier days, a recording studio used to be rented and a sound engineer and voiceover artist was hired for it. But, today the auditions for VO are done online and the best one with professional recording tools is hired.

#### 5\. Audio Mix

In this step, it is important to select and assemble the recorded sounds and start preparing the final mix of the sound in order to ensure proper lip sync and other sound effects needed for the final animation film.

Any heavy unwanted sounds are removed and significant spot sounds are added while mixing the pre-determined soundtrack.

![audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dj-audio-editor.jpg)

## Part 3: Edit and Export

#### 6\. Final Editing

Often the scenes for the animation film are randomly shot. There are a number of scenes that are shot just as a back up so that later while editing it can be checked and the best shot from many can be picked to include in the movie. All such things are finally checked in the final editing. It is the process of rearranging the clips so that the end product is flawless. Other editing task includes the addition of effects in the clips or text used in titling, etc.

#### 7\. Export

Exporting the animated movie is the last step in creating an animation. How to make an animation is no more a big reason for headache. If you want, you may also share it directly on the social media platforms with your friends and viewers.

## Conclusion

Now, as you know how to make an animation and the steps involved in it, you must also be aware of one of the best software for editing.

It's a very open subject.

### 01**GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads**

The best part of GIFs is that they are easily consumable media that you can share just about everywhere. For example, you can include them in your email marketing to bring a little life to what could have otherwise been a very dry message You can also have it play out on social media without prompting (different from videos, which the user usually has to play before it starts going.)

### 02**GIFs Can Be Used for Promoting Events**

GIFs are also great for promoting events or holiday sales It's basically just a moving 2D advertisement (like the one that is shown below). Eye-catching in a way that keeps you looking to catch the movement — in compared to if you were just looking at a still image (which might catch your attention for a moment, but usually bores you the next)

### 03**GIFs Can Be Used for Call-to-Action Pop-Ups**

Perhaps you've seen this already in some YouTube videos (see the GIF attached for an example), but a lot of content creators now include GIFs on their content to prompt their audience to complete an action — be it subscribing, sharing, downloading a link, buying a product, etc. It's a great way of getting a message across in a way that is both fun and straightforward

### 04**GIFs Can Be Used to Set the Scene and Express Emotion**

GIFs are also a great way to just generally set the scene or express emotion. Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving' pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.

### 05**GIFs Can Be Used to Tell a Story**

You know the saying, "A picture can speak a thousand words?" Well, it's true, but in comparison to GIFs??? Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example.

### 06**GIFs Can Be Used to Explain or Share Instructions**

In the same way that you can create long infographics to offer instructions or teach a lesson on a particular subject, GIFs can be used to educate your audience. Only, it's a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below

Often called traditional animation, **2D animation making** mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.

Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.

01 [Is 2D Animation Easy & How Do You Learn It?](#Part 1)

02 [The 5 Principles of Animation](#Part 2)

03 [3 Reasons to Create Animated Videos](#Part 3)

04 [5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 Is 2D Animation Easy & How Do You Learn It?

In 2020, the video became the #1 form of media for content strategy, overtaking infographics and blogs. Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.

We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we've described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the **2D animation making** the easy way!

First, let's look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: "What is 2D animation?"

You're probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).

So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.

Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it's not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, "is 2D animation dead?" but it's still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.

The best way to learn **2D animation making** is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.

If you have already started learning but aren't getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.

**Fact Check:**

A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.

Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don't have to think about everything.

If even they can't do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.

**●** Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.

**●** Get feedback from mentors and other artists.

**●** Increase the difficulty step by step.

## Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation

Animators follow a list of strict principles to create the most inspiring projects. And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o**f making 2D animation video** memorable.

### 01Squash and stretch

Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.

![squash and stretch animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-01.jpg)

### 02Anticipation

Anticipation is one of the essential **2D animation-making** principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.

![anticipation animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-02.jpg)

### 03Ease in ease out

Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.

![ease in animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-03.jpg)

### 04Timing

The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters' movements and objects.

![timing animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-04.jpg)

### 05Solid Drawing

Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object's dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.

![solid drawing animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-05.jpg)

## Part 2 3 Reasons to Create Animated Videos

We can describe a list of 5 reasons to use animation for business.

### 01It is fun

Your animation doesn't need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It's an ideal way to catch customers' attention instead of strictly for marketing.

### 02Lasting impression

The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.

So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.

### 03Boosts conversion rate

Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.

So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business's animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.

## Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making

The decision to excel in **2D animation making** could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won't get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.

You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let's discuss those points!

### 01Budget

The budget is the best factor because you can't do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent **2D** **animation software for beginners**. Yet, animation for business doesn't demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!

### 02Brand Positioning

Consider your brand positioning! While **2D animation making**, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.

It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand's overview from the customer's point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.

### 03Target Audience

The **2D animation making** also holds about the target audience, but it doesn't mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.

### 04Market

You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the **2D** **animation making**. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.

### 05Do Your Research in Advance

Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video's production from beginning to end.

You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you're promoting since a live-action video.

Powerful Video Editor Allows You Make Wonderful Animated Videos

Often called traditional animation, **2D animation making** mostly syncs with vector graphics via computer software. The aim is to create animated images useful in websites, advertisements, films, or computer games.

Furthermore, the 2D animation-making process includes creating storyboards, characters, and backgrounds in 2D space. Objects in 2D animation move up, down, right, and left, but not towards or away from the camera, such as in the 3D animation.

## Part 1 Is 2D Animation Easy & How Do You Learn It?

In 2020, the video became the #1 form of media for content strategy, overtaking infographics and blogs. Undoubtedly, the power of video marketing and animated videos offer a creative, unique, and sometimes more effective way to explain a concept or tell a story.

We asked Yakkety Yak Video Producer and animator extraordinaire Sean Froelich to give us his top 2D animation tips for beginners or tell us how they can be made accessible. So, with his comments, here we've described all the content you need for this section and how you can learn the **2D animation making** the easy way!

First, let's look at the difference between different kinds of animation and answer the question: "What is 2D animation?"

You're probably much more familiar with this animation style than you think. This work involves drawing 2D objects and characters within a flat space. Everything you draw only has a height and width but no depth (which would make it 3D).

So how do you get flat characters and objects to move? Here, the artist would move from the page or screen to specialist 2D animation software to sequence the individual images.

Classic Disney movies are good examples of creating 2D animation for the big screen, but it's not only in cinema that you can find this sort of project. You might hear people asking, "is 2D animation dead?" but it's still widely used for commercials, corporate marketing, advertising, video games, and more.

The best way to learn **2D animation making** is through courses and tutorials and taking inspiration from real-time scenarios.

If you have already started learning but aren't getting the progress you want, they are an excellent guide to get you back on the right track.

**Fact Check:**

A good animation includes various elements: Acting, Image Composition, Physics, film-making, body language, character design, world-building, and much more.

Even professionals use step-by-step workflows, so they don't have to think about everything.

If even they can't do it, why should you, as a beginner, overwhelm yourself? The best you can do is to tackle one challenge after the other.

**●** Deliberately practice single aspects of animation.

**●** Get feedback from mentors and other artists.

**●** Increase the difficulty step by step.

## Part 2 The 5 Principles of Animation

Animators follow a list of strict principles to create the most inspiring projects. And, these five basic principles stand above the rest as the most significant ones. Your animation will look wooden and fall flat if you ignore these fundamental principles o**f making 2D animation video** memorable.

### 01Squash and stretch

Squash and stretch give weight and authenticity to an object. For example, imagine a rubber ball bouncing on the ground. It squashes as it hits the ground and comes back up after it stretches. On the other hand, a metal ball would barely stretch or squash.

![squash and stretch animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-01.jpg)

### 02Anticipation

Anticipation is one of the essential **2D animation-making** principles to give animations a sense of grounding. For example, you must position your body to help you move before heading up from the chair. It would be unrealistic to get up without using your arms to help push your body up. This is why anticipation is crucial to consider.

![anticipation animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-02.jpg)

### 03Ease in ease out

Imagine the swinging pendulum of a clock. It slows down on each side before increasing the speed. This swinging from side to side would be the quickest in the middle and naturally slow down on each side. This is the essential aspect of easing in and out. It further moves to feel more natural.

![ease in animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-03.jpg)

### 04Timing

The quantity of drawings for a given action will vary based on the movements. Fast movements get less drawing while complex and slow movements need more. Timing will give believability to your characters' movements and objects.

![timing animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-04.jpg)

### 05Solid Drawing

Without any practice of solid drawing, an animator cannot use it effectively animate. On the other hand, with the concept of solid drawing, the animator understands the object's dimensions in 3D space. Therefore, depth, volume, and weight can convey to the necessary movement.

![solid drawing animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/best-guide-for-beginners-on2d-animation-making-05.jpg)

## Part 2 3 Reasons to Create Animated Videos

We can describe a list of 5 reasons to use animation for business.

### 01It is fun

Your animation doesn't need to be accurate or realistic. The main objective of using it in business or even cartoons is to instill entertainment and fun. It's an ideal way to catch customers' attention instead of strictly for marketing.

### 02Lasting impression

The animated videos for business leave a lasting impression on the current and new customers. Yet, you must be clear about using animation to convey your business creatively. A story too dragged from the business purpose may not be ideal for making a lasting impression.

So, convey the values you inject into a particular product so that the potential customers get attracted by the information they get from it.

### 03Boosts conversion rate

Due to the beautiful aspect of business animation videos, the customer is likely to finish the action expected by the brand. Therefore, more than half the visited customers will likely stay on the website with animated content instead of getting high bounce-off rates.

So, you should explain the merits of your product or service to the user in the business's animated videos. Please add CTA at the end of the video.

## Part 4 5 Essential Tips for Your 2D Animation Making

The decision to excel in **2D animation making** could be a tricky task even if you are aware of its significance, as mentioned above, of animation. However, knowing the importance won't get you on the right path without any implementation efforts.

You must implement the right strategies and know the essential factors before making animated videos for business. So, let's discuss those points!

### 01Budget

The budget is the best factor because you can't do anything without having money. So, you need to invest a fair amount or invest in decent **2D** **animation software for beginners**. Yet, animation for business doesn't demand a budget like creating a Pixar movie in millions. For instance, Wondershare Filmora will cost you around $156 per year, less than spending millions in outsourcing video animation work. Yet, it also depends on the style and job of business values you want to incorporate in the animation. You have to outsource if it is expert-level work!

### 02Brand Positioning

Consider your brand positioning! While **2D animation making**, viewers tend to remember more about the brand values. They must know your identity as a brand and the whole industry.

It will allow for incorporating some brand positioning before deciding to make animation videos for business. You can check the brand's overview from the customer's point of view. Then, you can instill the presentation according to your business type, whether B2B or B2C, afterward.

### 03Target Audience

The **2D animation making** also holds about the target audience, but it doesn't mean making videos only for them necessarily. The first question is why you are creating such a video. There could be various reasons, such as attaining new customers, educating the current customers, or raising the awareness of a latest brand or a product.

### 04Market

You must be aware of the ideas to market your videos before even beginning the **2D** **animation making**. The market can be Instagram, YouTube, or any other social media handle to get a high presence of a potential audience. Moreover, the video should not be too pushy.

### 05Do Your Research in Advance

Research is a natural starter of all the video production processes, regardless of the objective of a video. You are required to know everything there is to know about a service or a product your animated video is about to execute and plan the video's production from beginning to end.

You should decide if the 2D animated video is a good option for the product you're promoting since a live-action video.
