Today there is a lot pre-made skeletons you can use and reuse as many times as you want, making only a few minor adjustments to the base design. If your creativity is sparking like firecrackers, then a rig can make it look more defined and/or realistic.

Not convinced? Let’s talk more about **Rigging Animation**.

## Part 1 What is Rigging Animation

### 01Why Your Animators Need to Know How to Rig

Walk into any professional animation studio toady, you would notice unfamiliar skeleton figures in at least one of the screens.

This is called skeleton animation and is a major technique used in creating animated models that give us that 36vibe of the character in movies. It helps animators in controlling its movement just like a puppet. Hidden call back to the Matrix.

What you see in most movies or games, are characters and models who supported by a network of digital mechanical skeletons all rigged to move in a certain way.

### 02How Does Rigging Work?

The process of rigging is usually the second step in a long line of other methods applied after creating a model.

There is a series of interdependent bones that need to be constructed which is representation of the **skeletal structure** which is the basic goal in **rigging animation.**

With the right digital animation software you can reposition, repurpose and scale these bones in more ways than one.

The next step would involve recording the different movements of these bones on a timeline. This part of the process is called keyframing in animation.

These simple steps are actually more intricate than they actually are. Each movement acts as trigger to another set of movements like how the shoulder bone is connected to the forearm of our body.

This movement of the model becomes even more realistic once its weight scale has been determined. Painting weight can be considered to be the most unnerving challenge in the entire process.

Which is where Inverse Kinematics can help in making things 5easier by just reversing forward kinematic movements.

All of these aspects of rigging makes it possible to help animation mimic real life movements.

### 03How is Rigging Used?

Rigging is a technique which has only started gaining more prominence in recent times due to how crucial it is to the gaming and animation movie industry.

Not only is it used on characters but all mechanical objects in animations can also be rigged. With the help of a computerized program physicality is added to the bone structure and is recorded through a series of frames. These recording are then played back.

There are other applications to the and modelling process which goes beyond the entertainment industry such as giving virtual medical demonstrations or modeling a product.

This entire process can get much more repetitive and complex when it comes to rigging something as dynamic as the human face.

### 04Intro to Rigging Software

You might already be aware by now that there are some major animation software on the market that can provide you with just about every tool you need to make jaw dropping rigger animations.

Software like Blender, Cinema 4D, Maya and Houdini employs fantastic Skeletal Animation and digital motion capturing techniques. They open the doors to more realistic animations that can be used to create far more interactive and personalized digital worlds.

Maya and 3Ds Max is used to do real time animation rigging and is considered by most to be the industry standard by most animators.

Blender on the other hand is a free to use software. Though not quite as strong as Maya, it is an open source software which is equipped with everything you need to rig and animate models.

You can import completed animated files onto game engines and all types of other applications. The most common format for importing animated files is .fbx.

![animate title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-05.JPG)

So, that's how you can use Filmora to animate text-on-scroll to improve the overall visual appearance of your website videos.

### 02Scroll-Text-Animations for Single Words

![one line animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-06.JPG)

### 02Use ScrollSequence

Now, if you are not a professional editor or don't want to overcomplicate things, you can use ScrollSequence to add image-on-scroll animation to your website. For readers who don't know, ScrollSequence is a built-in WordPress plugin that you can directly install in your WordPress manager. The tool offers hundreds of ready-to-use animation templates that you can integrate and customize without any hassle.

### 03Write Your Own JavaScript Code

Finally, you can also write your own JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll. However, this method will be a bit complicated as you would require technical expertise to write dedicated JavaScript scripts to animate image-on-scroll. If you choose this solution, you'll have to start with writing HTML and CSS codes. This will help you style your web page in the beginning. And, once the web design is up and ready, you can move towards writing the JavaScript code to animate image-on-scroll in your web page.

## Part 2 How to Create a Scrolling Text Animation (Infinite Loop)

Like image-on-scroll, text-on-scroll is another popular way to add visually appealing animations to your web designs. Text-on-scroll animations work the same way as image-on-scroll animations - the only difference is that these types of animations focus on the text playback instead of images. Again, you can use different methods to **animate text on scroll** and make your website's content run in an infinite loop.

Some of these methods include:

### 01Use Filmora

Thanks to Filmora's advanced editing panel, you can also use it to animate text within the videos. This will be an ideal solution for users who want to add videos with dedicated text banners and titles on their websites. With Filmora, you'll be able to animate the text and make custom transitions in a hassle-free manner. Let's walk you through the detailed procedure of using Wondershare Filmora to add text animation to your videos.

**Step 1 -** Open Filmora on your system and load the video into its timeline.

**Step 2 -** Double-tap the video file, and switch to the "Titles" tab. You'll see a list of different title templates on your screen. Browse through these results and drag the desired template to the timelines. Make sure to adjust the title layer right above the video layer.

![choose title template filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-04.JPG)

**Step 3 -** Again, double-click the title layer and you'll see a dedicated text editor on your screen. Here enter the text that you want to display within the video. You can also select text size, orientation, and font to personalize its appearance.

**Step 4 -** Finally, switch to the "Animation" tab at the left sidebar. Choose any of these animation templates and the text within the video will be animated automatically.

![animate title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-animate-image-on-scroll-and-text-on-scroll-05.JPG)

So, that's how you can use Filmora to animate text-on-scroll to improve the overall visual appearance of your website videos.
