Sign in to Canva, then choose and make your social media story template. There are two vastly different ways to explore this: You can either select “Create a design” at the top or go for a particular template to get the ideal dimensions.

### 2\. Animate your video

Here’s where the fun begins! Now that you are ready to start editing your selected template, you can add animated and unique elements to your story in three various ways.

* Add a video

You’re ready to add in your video once you’ve chosen your template! Upload or select any video you might want to use and drag it into a placeholder on your story chosen template. If needed, adjust the size and positioning until it fits.

* Animated design elements

Another option to animate your social media posts videos is through the Elements feature in Canva by choosing the “Stickers” tab.

You can either enter your requirement in the search bar or scroll through Canva’s huge graphics and enter "animated {insert the word you're searching for, i.e., lines, arrows}. Then, you can drag and drop them right into your design.

There are specific search terms for your reference: Animated Sparkle, Animated Arrow, Animated Word, and Animated Line.

* Use the Animate button.

There’s an “Animate" button you'll see at the top when you're in your design. Hit on the page you wish to animate, and the Animate tab will pop up on the top left.

Use these three features to create an animated video individually or all together – they’ll be sure to up-level your stories in a fun and unique way.

So, now that we've explained the importance of animated logos, let's start with the step-by-step process of **creating an animated logo** using different solutions. First, we'll take a look at some of the premade logo templates that you can integrate and customize to speed up the entire process.

### 01Vortex Logo Reveal

If you want to use your animated logo in a dedicated video, Vortex logo reveal can be an ideal choice for the job. The template contains a 3-5 seconds animation that'll reveal your actual logo in a suspenseful manner.

### 023D Logo Animation

This is a pre-made animated logo template in After Effects that you can integrate with a single tap. The template simply shatters the logo into pieces after the initial reveal to create a dramatic effect for the viewers.

### 03Gold Luxury Logo Reveal

If you're worried that using 3D-effects might overdo the animations, you can use this simple gold luxury logo reveal template. As compared to the previous two templates, this one has a simple animation and will help you convey your message more effectively.

### 04Waving 3D Logo Reveal

This logo is a widely popular AE animated logo template that many users buy to make their logos more appealing. The template utilizes motion graphics and a clean animation to reveal the actual brand logo while keeping the viewers engaged throughout the process.

### 05Infinite Zoom Logo Reveal

Want to reveal your animated logo in a unique manner? This template has got you covered. The After Effects logo template will allow you to use different pictures to reveal the logo with the traditional zoom-out transition. You can use all the pictures that represent your brand to add the required business values to your logo.

### 06Space Animation

Space animation is another After Effects template that's ideal for brands who want to reveal their brand logo in a visually appealing manner. Different stars in the cosmos will combine together to represent your logo and leave a great first impression on the viewers.

## Part 3 5 Steps to Animate Your Logo

Now, let's move towards the next phase of **creating an animated logo**, i.e., animating the logo itself. It doesn't matter which software you use to get the job done, you can adhere to the following steps to achieve the best results and create a visually stunning animated logo.

### 01Prepare the Simple Logo

In every situation, you'll first have to prepare the simple one-dimension logo that you've been using so far. To create this logo, you can use a wide variety of tools such as Adobe Photoshop or even a simple logo maker such as Canva. Keep in mind that you should implement all the customization on the design during this stage only.

### 02Import the Logo File

The next step towards creating the animated logo is to simply import your logo file into the tool that you want to use to do the job. For instance, if you are planning to use Adobe After Effects, simply click "File > Open" and select the logo file to load it into AE's editing panel. Once the file is successfully imported, you can move towards the next step.

### 03Choose the Right Animation Template

Now, you can proceed towards choosing the right animation template for your animated logo. It doesn't matter which software you're using for **creating an animated logo**, you'll find dozens of built-in templates that can be integrated into the design with one click. Choose any of these templates and move towards the next step.

### 04Apply the Keyframes

After you've successfully imported the file and chosen a dedicated animation template, the next step would be to apply the keyframes. In tools like After Effects, you'll find a built-in slider that'll allow you to adjust the keyframes to customize the animation.

### 05Make the Final Adjustments

Finally, make the final adjustments to the animation. For instance, you can customize the color scheme or color-grade the logo for better visual appearance. You can also add other objects on top of the design to enhance the overall quality of the logo.

## Part 4 What is the Best Software to Animate a Logo?

Here are the top three software you can use to get started with your animated logo and complete the process.
