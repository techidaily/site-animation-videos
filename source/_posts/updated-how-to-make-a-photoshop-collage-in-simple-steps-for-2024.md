## Part 3 Create Animated Good Morning/Night GIFs with Canva

Canva is one of the most user-friendly online solutions that you can use to come up with graphics of different styles. From social media posts to posters and video clips to logos, Canva can help you develop all types of customized designs. A while back, it has added a dedicated option to create and edit animations that would let you come up with some stunning good morning/night GIF images.

##### Step 1 Select a Project Type or Template of Canva

At first, you can go to the official website of Canva and choose to work on a template of your choice. Here, you can look for GIFs readily available on Canva or work on an empty canvas.

![canva explore gif templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-10.jpg)

##### Step 2 Customize your Good Morning/Night GIF on Canva

## Part 4 Find Readily Available Good Morning/Night GIFs

If you are running short on time and can’t come up with any good morning/night animated GIF, then you can pick them from the following resources:

### 1\. Tenor

Tenor is certainly one of the most prominent websites to find GIFs and stickers of all kinds. Therefore, you can head to its official website and look for good morning/night animations by entering relevant keywords on the search bar. Later, you can download the GIF or directly share its link with others.

![enor good morning gifs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-13.jpg)

### 2\. Giphy

Like Tenor, Giphy is another popular source where you can find hundreds of good night/morning funny GIFs. The website is quite easy to navigate and will let you see all kinds of GIFs by entering appropriate keywords. Later, you can directly copy the URL of the GIF and share it with others on platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram.

### Conclusion

After reading this guide, I’m sure that you can easily pick or create all kinds of good night/morning GIFs. While Photoshop can make animated good morning/night GIFs, it is certainly not that user-friendly. That’s why I would recommend using a reliable and friendly application like Wondershare Filmora to meet your requirements. The media-editing tool has an extensive range of assets and offers tons of high-end features to come up with all sorts of inspiring, romantic, or funny good morning/night GIFs.
