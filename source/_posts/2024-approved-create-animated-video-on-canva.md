Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

## Part 1 **Should You Study 3D Animation?**

![learning 3d animation 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginners-guide-for-learning-3d-animation-02.jpg)

3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with **3D animation courses online for free** to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.

As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:

**●** Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.

**●** 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.

**●** 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.

You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:

**●** **Modeling:** The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time.

## Part 1 Does Adobe Have 3D Animation Software?

You'll be able to create a range of animation styles using After Effects CC once you grasp the basic concepts. This gets started in an animation tutorial by Sara Barnes, which teaches you top tips for animating illustrations in After Effects, beginning with the basics.

Adobe After Effects is software for making special effects and motion graphics used in online content, video, and other presentations. It is available on both Mac OS and Windows PC. The After Effects is famous in TV and film post-production for creating animation, special effects, and video compositing.

Tasks made using After Effects can be helpful in videos, broadcast TV, web, kiosks, and in-store displays - a part of the Adobe Creative Cloud.

This software can create a cartoon character, design titles, and apply animation. Although **Adobe 3D animation** can do all these tasks, it is not similar to video editing software.

This program can apply effects after the footage has been edited or create motion graphics and animation from static objects created otherwise.

It is a tool for storytelling and visually making those appealing motion graphics that integrate into any medium to improve a presentation, image, story, or mood.

### 01How is After Effects used?

The primary uses of After Effects categorize into three sections:

**Effects**,

**Animation**, and

**Compositing.**

The kind of animation for which After Effects is widely used is Motion Graphics, which includes making the motion of traditionally static objects such as text, logos, and other graphic elements.

Sometimes called visual effects (VFX), the effects are famous in video and film. For example, adding snow to a video scene, creating water or fire, making objects appear to turn into liquid are all instances of different effects - After Effects can create these visual effects from your video.

It also implies digital compositing, including merging multiple videos into a single product and integrating various videos via compositing.

### 02Who uses After Effects?

The After Effects is valuable to animators, visual artists, advertising agencies, video editors, video artists, video producers, social media professionals, motion graphics designers, UX professionals, etc. Gaining proficiency in After Effects comes in-depth from training, tutorials, and other hands-on use courses.
