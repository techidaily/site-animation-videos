## Part 1 How to Create Custom Animated WhatsApp Stickers on Android and iPhone

Animated third-party stickers cannot be added directly to WhatsApp and thus you can create a customized one. To create these GIF stickers for WhatsApp, you would need the help of third-party apps.

For Android devices, one such popular app is the Sticker Maker app. For iPhone, we suggest using Sticker Maker Studio app.

Once these apps are installed on your device, GIF stickers can be made in no time.

**Steps to make sticker GIF WhatsApp on Android phone**

Step 1\. Download, install and open the Sticker maker app on your Android device.

Step 2\. Tap on the "Create a new sticker pack" option on your app.

Step 3\. Give the desired name to your sticker pack and click on the Create button.

Step 4\. To add the animated stickers, click on the created sticker pack.

Step 5\. Next, click on the first box, and then from the menu choose the Select file option.

Step 6\. Next, choose the video from your phone from which you wish to create a sticker. You can even add a GIF file. After the media file is added, the app will compress it and will turn it into an animated sticker automatically.

Step 7\. Now, you need to add 3 animated stickers to the other boxes of the sticker app (as mentioned in step 5).

Note: Multiple stickers can be added using the same process.

Step 8\. Click on the "Add to WhatsApp" button after a minimum of 3 stickers are added to the pack.

Step 9\. Now, your stickers are ready. Open the WhatsApp chat and launch the sticker panel where you can see your created GIF stickers. Choose the sticker you want, add it to your chat, and send it.

**Steps to make WhatsApp Sticker GIF on iPhone**

Step 1\. On your iPhone, download, install and launch the Sticker Maker Studio app from the app store.

Step 2\. Choose the sticker pack and also the name of the author at the respective boxes and then click on the Create button.

Step 3\. Next, click on the new sticker pack that is created.

Step 4\. Multiple boxes will now appear from which you need to choose the first one and then

select the Files option.

Step 5\. Choose the desired Video from your device from which sticker has to be created. You can also create **GIF to WhatsApp sticker**. Other stickers to the pack can be added similarly. The app will automatically convert the added file to a sticker.

Step 6\. After the stickers are added (at least 3), click on the Add to WhatsApp button at the generated Tray icon.

Note: If you see your tray icon to be blank, click on it else there will be issues adding the stickers to the WhatsApp chat later. A tray icon can be selected from the images.

Step 7\. Next, you will be asked if you wish to open WhatsApp, click on Okay.

Step 8\. Now, to add the animated GIF stickers to WhatsApp, you need to click on the Save button and your stickers are ready to be used in the chat.
