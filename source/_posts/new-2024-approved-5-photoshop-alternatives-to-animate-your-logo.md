## Part 1 Top 10 Animated Photo Collage Apps

We’ve compiled an index of the top 10 animated collage apps compatible with photo enthusiasts and photographers at every level of expertise. Most of these amazing apps are available for both iOS and Android, so there are numerous options no matter what device you’re using.

Before showcasing your collage-making skills, gather the perfect images from your last photography project.

### 1\. GIPHY

![giphy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-2.jpg)

The GIPHY is the mega search engine for all things related to GIFs.

Here, you can easily upload and find reaction memes for anything under the sun; GIPHY is also available with a mobile app. It also helps you to frame your GIFs and animate photos. Then, you can upload them by using the inbuilt animation tools on the platform.

It consists of a sticker maker (available for iPhone X and later), and you can also add captions to your animated images or shoot your short videos.

### 2\. Motionleap

![motionleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-5.jpg)

Motionleap is also an ideal animated photo collage app, and for a good reason. This app is highly reviewed, with 250,000 plus ratings of five stars in the Play Store.

Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there's a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn't put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.

The app's primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.

You can also freeze certain image sections and apply filters on top of your picture to frame an atmosphere within your image.

Unluckily, Motionleap saves your animated still photos in video format unless you've paid for a Pro account.

### 3\. Movepic

![movepic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg)

Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.

ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can't remove unless you update to a complete account.

### 6\. StoryZ

![storyz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg)

![movepic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-6.jpg)

Movepic is almost similar to Motionleap in that it animates images, but you can make a massive chunk of this animation with its inbuilt filters and overlays.

The only limitation is that you wouldn't be able to remove the watermark without updating it to a VIP account. Movepic also saves your pictures automatically as a movie file than within a GIFformat.

### 4\. ImgPlay

![imgplay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-3.jpg)

ImgPlay is another ideal animated collage maker app you can use to animate images. It creates ready-to-use animated images for the web and consists of easy-to-understand yet advanced controls. Unfortunately, it also adds a watermark on your image—one that you can't remove unless you update to a complete account.

The process of making animated images online and GIFs can be in a couple of different ways within ImgPlay itself. You can use still photographs side-by-side, use burst images, or even videos.

### 5\. Zoetropic

![zoetropic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-11.jpg)

If you wish to animate your photo within a few minutes only, Zoetropic is for you. Though its functions aren't as extensive as other apps we've mentioned, it does the job pretty well.

To get started, you choose your images and then select motion points. Next, you mask or stabilize the areas you want to keep still. Finally, you choose your overlays and animations. You can also change colors and add tags.

On the downside, it has limited the number of effects you can access on a free account. However, you might find what you're considering if you are looking for a prompt manner to animate a photo online.

### 6\. StoryZ

![storyz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-8.jpg)

Despite its unattractive user interface, StoryZ is one of the useful apps on this list. It works excellent with still photographs to animate them effectively via various programmed paths of movements, overlays, and color filters—a lot of which are free and unique. It also automatically saves your files as GIFs.

One of the most incredible things about StoryZ is cutting the watermark from your image if you preview a quick ad before saving the file.

### 7\. Lumyer

![lumyer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-4.jpg)

Lumyer is one of the useful animated photo collage apps on our list, which lets you add hundreds and thousands of effects to your pictures to animate them. So whether you wish to include sparkle or subtle weather effects, seasonal animations for Christmas and Halloween, or all-out scene transformations like appearing on a rollercoaster, Lumyer can do it.

If you're okay with the watermark, Lumyer is a good choice, but otherwise, you may prefer one of our other recommended photo animation college apps.

### 8\. VIMAGE 3D

![vimage 3d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-9.jpg)

VIMAGE got recognized with Google Play award in 2018\. It can make some pretty good-looking animated photos in just a few clicks. There's a wide variety of animations, filters, and sounds to select among a bundle of options.

You don't even need to select the object because VIMAGE detects and replaces it for you quite automatically.

Similar to these apps, you do need to pay to remove the watermark, get access to the full effects library, and you can export your photos online in up to 2560p resolution.

### 9\. Photo Bender

![photo bender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-7.jpg)

Photo Bender is an Android-specific animated photo collage app that helps you warp to animate photos digitally by coloring your image by stretching it, bending it, and using brushes. You can then export your transformed images as GIFs, JPEGs, MP4s, and PNGs.

While this app doesn't contain ratings like others on this list, it is highly rated, so it's still worth a look.

### 10\. Werble

![werble](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/animated-photo-10.jpg)

The primary purpose of Werble is to animate your images, and while the basic account is free, in-app purchases are also available. Most of Werble's animations come through different filter effects that you can add on top of your images.

A downside to Werble is that it saves these images entirely automatically as GIFs, so they're ready to use online. The limitation? However, you need to pay to cut the watermark that they place on your image. That watermark is huge enough to be disturbing.

Motionleap is a free animated photo collage app, although there's a subscription and Pro version, too. Also, it doesn't put a watermark over your image when you download it to your phone.

The app's primary goal is animating still images and converting them into short, concise, and looping videos. Programming directional cues can easily do it into your image by dragging your thumb across the screen.

Anime is an elaborate form of animation with its bright colors and vivid imagination. It is a modified version of animation as we know it in the West with a peculiar Japanese taste of art. Combining the thematic elements of fiction and fantasy with science give a distinctive feel. Anime brings a wide variety of characters and personalities to life, from hardcore badass to shy girls, and everything in between. There is a unique character for everyone out there to relate to in this vast universe of Japanese anime series.

Now, who is the **coolest anime character** in the history of anime, and what are **[10 popular cartoon characters that you won't want to miss](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**? It’s been debated on the internet forums for as long as the forums have been around. I thought I’d also give my perspective to the conversation, so I’ve compiled a list of the **best anime characters** in the anime world. The factors I considered were impact, legacy, recognition, and, most importantly, the artistic greatness giving the character unique power.

## Top 10 Coolest Anime Characters Ever

* [1\. Light Yagami (Death Note)](#part1)
* [2\. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)](#part2)
* [3\. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)](#part3)
* [4\. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)](#part4)
* [5\. Levi (Attack on Titan)](#part5)
* [6\. Saitama (One Punch Man)](#part6)
* [7\. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)](#part7)
* [8\. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)](#part8)
* [9\. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)](#part9)
* [10\. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)](#part10)

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

## Final Words

Every anime character brings its feel and looks to the fictional world. As the vivid and ornate form of art, anime presents a different view of the world and the human mind's capabilities in creating such an intense augmentation of unreal to animated life.

### 1. Light Yagami (Death Note)

Devilish, determined, and calculating to revamp the world in his own image, Light Yagami was the force behind the success of Death Note. The story much relied on Light’s cleverness and his layered plans. But once he gets possession of the death note, he commences an astonishing into a disturbing mastermind who becomes judge, jury, and the executioner for the whole world. The anime was exceedingly addictive, an absolute unputdownable material due to the author Tsugumi Ohba’s clever use of cliffhangers.

The misguided character of Light is an intricate mix of goals to make the world a happier, safer place but with a wrong mindset. His brilliance marks Light’s development throughout the series. His idealism and nobility shine when he relinquishes the hold of the Death Note, temporarily turning into a kindhearted and moral being. These intricate set qualities pool together to end up creating a complicated character who ends up being a despicable villain; still, you root for him to come out of the story as a winner.

### 2. Itachi Uchiha (Naruto)

Itachi Uchiha has a vivid and unique backstory, known as the Batman of anime, which sums up how cool he is. He is a martyr, a true hero who was wronged by those in power and, therefore, a pitiable character. The character starts their journey by witnessing a World War at the age of 4 years old, which turned him into a pacifist. Itachi has a strange sadness, willingness to do what’s right, and faithfulness to the leaf village. He is the anti-hero that fans couldn’t think as bad as they stared into his dreamy Sharingan-filled eyes. Their charisma is extraordinary with his iconic design, mysterious history, and cool moves.

### 3. Naruto Uzumaki(Naruto)

The loudmouth ninja in the leaf village is a brash and immature person from the start, and the most usual way of communication is screaming in your face. Naruto is a pure goofball, but when it comes to his capabilities, he’s by far the most determined and fierce fighter I’ve ever seen in the anime world. He’s an idealistic fool, but it’s hard not to admire the code of honor that goes with it. Naruto’s only life goal is to become Hokage; however, passing ninja school proves to be a tough goal.

Naruto grew up feared and shunned by his fellow villagers because of the nine-tailed fox malevolent spirit sealed inside his body. Under the mentorship of Kakashi, he learns to overcome many obstacles for a carefree soul to handle. In his prankish and ramen-loving character, an ambitious, loftier Naruto is hidden, trying to achieve his life goal and lead his village is no romantic fantasy. His determination is so strong that his character becomes the very epicenter of persistence in life, as he often announces, “I’m going to make everyone recognize my existence!”.

### 4. Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop)

Blend Bruce Lee’s martial art with an overdose of film noir, with a bit of a cool, and you get Spike Spiegel. Spike was an amalgamation of several influences resulting in a creation that was more than the sum of its parts. Cowboy Bebop 1998 was a mixture of cultures from around the world, and Spike was the essence of the story. Voice actor Steve Blum gave Spike a feel of smooth, effortless cool that arguably outshined the original Japanese version.

Spike presented a versatile character, a gearhead working on this own spaceship, an expert pickpocket, a smart detective, a hardcore fighter, while also a bit of a philosopher. However, the most attractive thing that made Spike was his past as a gangster, and a man hopelessly in love. Spike left in a blaze of glory unique in all anime history.

### 5. Levi (Attack on Titan)

A personification of the phrase “big things come in small packages.” Levi has a complicated and fascinating history and humanity’s strongest yet short. He never smiles and appears irritable, short-tempered, and challenging to approach. Notwithstanding his coarse behavior, fashions a trademark cravat around the neck. A steadfast, realistic, empathetic character expresses no fear, anxiety, and glaring weakness. He’s a veteran and knows his stuff is through everything. Levi is always focused on finding no time for humor or banter. With virtually no social skills and can be considered a sincere man.

His character challenges the notion of perfection and attains maximum potential when the main story even begins. He embodies many positive traits such as passion and love for humanity, skills, decisiveness, pragmatism, and wisdom. He’s the very best humanity has to offer but still flawed.

### 6. Saitama (One Punch Man)

Saitama, the One Punch Man, is formidably the strongest character in anime. The series is different from most other combat anime, as, in this series, the protagonist is already the most hardened person around. After three years of rigorous training, Saitama was able to withstand any blow and defeat any enemy. Though his supreme power and strength leave him depressed, the character explores the emptiness after achieving a lifelong goal. The entire series surrounds the point that the pursuit of power or one’s lifelong goal is more fulfilling than actually holding such a position. He is not after popularity, reward, or not even survival; Saitama did everything for fun.

### 7. Portagas D Ace (One Piece)

Portagas is a two-faced one-piece character that manages to combine his goofy side with the loyal side, and everything is sprinkled with a tinge of cool over. The character is never backing from a fight. His love for his brother is so deep that he is willing to protect him even if it costs him his life. He is much polite and pragmatic than his younger brother. At times he is cool during combat, while at other times, his softer side shows when he is with his brother. His fire abilities help in the fight and will not let anyone hurt Monkey.

### 8. Meliodas(The Seven Deadly Sins)

Meliodas is the son of the Demon King and is sturdy and durable. Having monstrous strength, ability to reflect any magic, and command over the flames of hell, as well as cursed immortality. Meliodas is perhaps the most powerful and strongest character in The Seven Deadly Sins and any anime series for that matter. From his stature and cute appearance, he appears a physically weak and less potent; however, he essentially holds an incredible demonic strength that is yet to appear in any other anime series.

The dominant traits of Meliodas are frankness and utter fearlessness. He’s also very vulgar and loves to tell jokes frequently, while his strong sense of justice and willingness to help people in distress stand out.

### 9. Shoto Todoroki(My Hero Academia)

Shoto Todoroki is a wealthy and serious but well-meaning young man. He is reasonably tall, quite muscular, with a well-built body for his age. He is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), the Flame Hero. However, Shoto grew up resenting his father as a result of the lifetime abuse he endured from his father, both physical and verbal. He is half cold and half hot, a combination of ice Quirk of his mother and fire Quirk of his father. He’s raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might and being a successor to him. He hates his father for only viewing him as a tool and as a rebellion, vows to become the number one her without ever using his fire abilities.

Shoto wears a hero costume while performing heroics and is packed with a list of features like resisting intense heat, body temperature sensor to either cool or heat it to keep it regulated. Despite his stoic exterior and proficient combating skills, he’s socially awkward and is quite compassionate. One of the most influential and intelligent people in his Class 1-A, he tends to get very intense with his emotions.

### 10. Killua Zaoldyeck(Hunter X Hunter)

Killua Zoldyck’s story is about finding purpose and love in life without having to abandon nature. He develops from a young assassin who lacked self-worth to a hunter that became the brother and best friend anyone could ever ask. Killua’s character is attractive because he tackles his inner struggles by learning from the relationships he makes in his life. He belongs to an infamous hunter family and has to bear many tortures at a young age. As a result, he becomes immune to poison, agile and strong, develops high electricity tolerance, and turns his nails into sharp claws.

Despite his training and years of torture, he doesn’t accept his fate and yearns for something more – being a normal childhood life for once. He wants to make friends, notwithstanding his brother saying he can’t have friends. He becomes best friends with Gon, a complete opposite of Killua, innocent, honest, and having an optimistic look at life. He feels indebted to Gon and struggles to protect his friend while simultaneously dealing with his fear of being unable to fight against a stronger opponent. Gon became the Light for Killua’s inner darkness and proof of self-worth; Gon learns compassion and friendship.

## Final Words
