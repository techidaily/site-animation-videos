## 5 Different Animation Styles

Ready to enter into the world of animation along with us? We are all set to take you through a ride of different animation styles, their importance, and some of the videos that one should give a try!

#### 1\.  2D Animation

Let’s start with 2D as our fist animation style, which is the traditional or oldest form in practice for more than 100 years since 1908\. 2D has widely been in usage to create animated short films, cartoon characters, games, marketing videos, and educational materials. In 2D animation, the characters or items, creatures, and backgrounds get crafted in a two-dimensional space. It produces a graphic of movement with the drawings played serially one after another.

**Recommended Software**: At present, various free animator tools like Creatoon, Blender, and Pencil 2D, whereas, for professionals, Encore, Flash, Toon Boom Harmony, and Adobe Photoshop can be handy!

The above 2D animation style video is a short film “Dark Dark Woods” directed by the students at “The Animation Workshop.” It is all about the young princess, Maria, drenched, and tired of living a royal life being filled with rules, duties, lessons, responsibilities, and customs. One night, she enters into an adventurous event where she finds herself in a mysterious monster-filled dark wood. Watch the film and find did she find out there!

#### 2\.  3D Animation

As the next version of 2D, in the animation industry, 3D revolutionized the market since its first appearance in 1972\. Like 2D, 3D finds applications in varied platforms like a business, education, and entertainment. Still, the difference is they are unique and created in three-dimensional space using computer graphics and cinematography techniques as well. The pictures or characters look perfected with cutting-edge technology where toy story movie is an outstanding example.

**Recommended Software**: One can try some of the 3D modeling software packs like Maya, Houdini, Modo, ZBrush, and Lightwave 3D.

Do you know how it feels if you are trapped alone on a deserted island? "It's a Cinch!" is a fantastic, funny 3D short film that is an adventurous movie made by the ESMA team at CGI. For sure, you will like this funny movie all about atrocities happening with a man and a pelican and enjoy it as much as I did!

#### 3\.  Motion Graphics

Our next animation style is motion graphics of the animated graphic design, where text appears to be the main enhancing factor. It is a piece of animation or digital footage that illuminates a motion or notation incorporated with audio. It is a new way of communicating to the audience and in driving them deep into the story. You can categorize it under the visual effect technique, which involves the movement of graphic images or elements like logos or text, sound, music, and motion. Motion graphics are best to be found in action and finds a place in multimedia projects, advertising agencies, branding, television title making, and storytelling.

**Recommended Software**: Tools that are best for motion graphics is Mocha AE, After Effects, Illustrator, and Cinema 4D.

The world is a great place, but we always forget another beautiful hidden green world behind the fantastic buildings we reside in. Yes, “Beautiful World” is a motion graphic video by Blasterjaxx & DBSTF feat. Ryder presents how we humans have developed a great empire by destroying the other beautiful part of the world.

#### 4\.  Stop Motion

Stop motion is one of the traditional animation styles that is the most popular filmmaking technique that uses hand-crafted or manipulated objects, mostly clay models. Puppets, silhouettes, and cut-outs can also be implemented as stop motion aids to produce animation. It is labor-intensive, a form of art, and has its flavor in animation, although 3D and visual effects have replaced it quite a long time before. But still, filmmakers like Tim Burton use stop motion in their films, making it to withstand the animation industry.

**Recommended Software**: You can make your stop motion video with software like Dragon frame, Stop Motion Pro Eclipse, and IKITMovie.

Although stop motion has gone before ages, there is still a fantastic introduction. Here is an award-winning short film, "Tokri (the basket)," which is a clumsy accident that leads a juvenile girl onto Mumbai's streets with the trust of making things correct. Studio Eeksaurus, an Indian bastion animation company, has depicted a father and daughter's tender emotive tale.

#### 5\.  Paint-On-Glass Animation

Here is a Paint-on-Glass animation style that is a technique used for making animated films that gives a lot of fun. Artists paint short stories on glasses using oil paints and film them by recording it frame-by-frame. Russian animator Aleksandr Petrov is a famous artist well known for making award-winning paint-on-glass animation. Animators use different objects like brick dust, sand, pastels, and charcoal, to create outstanding drama in their films.

**Recommended Software**: You can also become a paint-on-glass animator now with tools like Pencil 2D, Blender, Krita, and GIMP.

Suppose you are wondering whether you could find any paint-on-glass animated movie on social media sites. In that case, there are numerous animated films, like "The Old Man and the Sea," and "My Love," produced by the experts of pictures of Aleksandr Petrov animation. Surprisingly, this bind-blowing introduction is a result of oil paints on a sheet of glass.

### Conclusion

## Part 1 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project

As I've mentioned before, there are various types and styles of cartoon drawings. Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.

### 01Modern Cartoon Style

This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.

Note that this **cartoon-style drawing's** main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.

One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating **cartoon drawing style**!

This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:

**●** The Powerpuff Girls

**●** Dexter's Laboratory

**●** Codename: Kids Next Door

**●** Gravity Falls

### 02Realistic Cartoon Style

This **cartoon drawing style** is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic **cartoon-style drawing** adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people's photographs.

You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!

Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:

**●** Ugly Americans

**●** General Caricataures

**●** Archer

### 03Modern Anime

This style tends to be more complex, primarily seen in drawings where the characters seem to be in motion, like in comic books. Modern-day drawings of this style have a lot of shadows and highlights in their character and environment, giving them a relatively new level of complexity.

Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese **cartoon drawing style**.

**●** My Hero Academia

**●** Sword Art Online

**●** Attack on Titan

**●** Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood

### 04Classic Manga

The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.

Generally, this **cartoon drawing style** focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.

A few examples of classic manga possessing this **cartoon style drawing** are:

**●** Oh My Goddess

**●** Urusei Yatsura

**●** Sailor Moon

**●** Hellsing

### 05Chibi Drawing Style

The Chibi **Cartoon Drawing Style** mainly focuses on making the characters into a tiny version of themselves as if being compressed or compacted into a small container.

Examples of where this drawing style is used:

**●** Lucky Star

**●** Bottle Fairy

**●** Himouto! Umaru-chan

### 06The Simpsons Cartoon Drawing Style

This **cartoon-style drawing** is widely famous. Though this style has undergone some evolution throughout the years, the main features remained constant! That is to say, the yellow bodies and big and white sphere-like eyes remained.

### 07Classic Disney

This drawing style was a staple for years, though this drawing style has had an evolutionary cartoon drawing style over the years.

### 08Mid 20th Century Disney

Disney upped their game during the mid 20th century and started working more with live actors, drawing from references, and filming shots before drawing the cartoons.

Some remarkable examples of this **cartoon drawing style** are

**●** Alice in Wonderland

**●** Cinderella

**●** Beauty and the Beast

### 09Modern Disney Drawing Style

This **cartoon-style drawing** is an immediate improvement of the mid-20th 20th drawing style. This cartoon style is brighter, more detailed, and more complex generally.

Although Disney has stopped creating 2D cartoon drawings, there are still some examples of this more refined art style:

**●** The Princess and the Frog

**●** Lilo and Stitch

### 10Old Cartoon Drawing Style

This drawing style is mostly in black and white format, with very high contrast body parts. The features of this style are having short bodies and long limbs. Sometimes, this type of drawing is referred to as Noodle drawing because the character's body moves as if there are no bones in their body.

Some examples of this **cartoon drawing** **style** include:

**●** Mickey Mouse

**●** Betty Boop

### 11South Park

South Park **cartoon drawing style** is aptly geometric and has little depth. Shadows or highlights in this cartoon-style are rare. The colors are pretty solid and clean.

### 12Chrono Trigger/ Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama)

Akira Toriyama's **cartoon drawing style** characterizes having big and almost rectangular eyes and a lot of geometric shapes and definitions in the muscles.

### 13Crayon Shin-Chan

This **cartoon-style drawing** is effortless. An exciting aspect of this style is that it doesn't mind pushing the limits of the character.

The lines generally are thin, and the eyes are prominent in black and white colors.

### 14Betty Boop

 Betty Boop's **cartoon drawing style** possesses contrasting black and white colors. Fragile lines with the characters contain a very high amount of black shapes.

### 15Adventure Time

Adventure Time's art is incredibly geometric, and its characters are nearly boneless, making it a more current example of a cartoon drawing style.

More fluid animation is possible as a result of this. The art is also quite brilliant, with vibrant hues that leap off the screen.

Aside from that, the characters' eyes are usually tiny (with a few exceptions), and the lines are skinny.

## Part 1 **Should You Study 3D Animation?**

![learning 3d animation 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginners-guide-for-learning-3d-animation-02.jpg)

3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with **3D animation courses online for free** to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.

As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:

**●** Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.

**●** 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.

**●** 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.

You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:

**●** **Modeling:** The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form. According to the 3D animation forum, it takes at least eight months to learn how to animate if only you spend about three to four hours every day. It takes firm dedication to **learn 3D animation and graphic design courses**.

## Part 1 **Should You Study 3D Animation?**

![learning 3d animation 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginners-guide-for-learning-3d-animation-02.jpg)

3D animation is a graphic design technique that uses motions to bring props, characters, objects, etc., to life. For a long time, 3D animation has created TV shows, films, and games, but now it is widely used to create materials for businesses that help them advertise their services and products. The most common usage of 3D animation is creating three-dimensional moving objects and placing them in a digital environment. There is software used to generate these objects specifically for 3D animation with **3D animation courses online for free** to learn how to use such software. This software helps 3D animators to create the illusion of movement needed to bring these objects to life.

As the popularity of 3D animation begins to grow, its usage also increases. 3D animation can be useful for the following:

**●** Many businesses use 3D animation for presentation and more examples and graphics.

**●** 3D animation is used in real estate as many apartment complexes use it to create interior and exterior renders for their properties. 3D animation allows renters or buyers to view the property without visiting it.

**●** 3D animation can also be valuable in the medical industry to create exciting graphics for presentation.

You can divide the process of 3D animation into three primary phases:

**●** **Modeling:** The modeling stage is how characters or objects get created. This stage can include scanning natural objects into a computer or using a modeling tool. Both methods are helpful and outstanding. When you scan real-world objects into your computer, it saves a lot of time; creating a model entirely by yourself using a tool will give you control over the entire look. Irrespective of the methods used, textures must be added to the character or objects before moving to the next stage.

**●** **Animation and layout:** At this stage, the created models are animated and positioned into a particular scene, first determining a layout by creating a set and adding objects into it. The characters and things must be animated by assigning animation variables, and then models within the scene can be given life through motion capture and keyframing.

**●** **Rendering**: This stage is where the scene generates into the finished image by using a specific software as the process of rendering cannot be handled by a typical computer

For **learning 3D animation**, practice, to make yourself perfect for getting your 3D animation as smooth and precise as you would like it to take some time. If your set goal is to create 3D characters, you first need to know how to recreate people in a digital form.
