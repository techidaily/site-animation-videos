**Cartoon character drawing** is usually a vital aspect of any child's life who loves to watch cartoon series and can sometimes be someone's favorite thing in the world.

![how to draw cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-1.jpg)

A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child's life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.

However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing **cool cartoon drawings** that will match different audiences, both older and younger.

![how to draw cartoons characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

Step 1:

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**Step 7:** Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

## Part 1 **How to Draw Cartoon Characters Step by Step**

Note that in the world we live in, Professionals were once students, and experts were once beginners. This means that everyone has a starting point, and they all have one thing in common: "learning." Whether you are aspiring to become an English teacher, an astrophysicist, an artist, or a physician's assistant, you must first learn the ins and outs of the field.

Those aspiring to become animators and cartoonists must first learn the basics of **cartoon character drawing** and practice some **easy, simple cartoon drawing** before cranking out the Mickey-Mouses of the entertainment world. However, we will cover the basic principles of **easy cartoon drawing for beginners** step by step to get your learning process started. Here is how to draw a Micky-Mouse perfectly:

![how to draw cartoons characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

Step 1:

**●** Use a pencil to begin your drawing.

**●** First, create a circle for the head and a curved line on the left side.

**●** Draw a horizontal line at the center.

**Step 2:** Next, draw an oval shape for the mouth and a "U" shape added to the bottom, and then you can add another parallel "U" shape and connect it with the oval.

**Step 3:** Draw the eye using two upside-down "U" shapes, and then you add his large ear on the right and a small one at the top of the head.

**Step 4:** You can draw a bean shape and another smaller one inside for the body.

**Step 5:** Add oval shapes for his feet to draw his legs and draw his tail on the right side just above the leg.

**Step 6:** Draw two elongated shapes for his arms, a small oval for the hand and a basic shape of his fingers.

**Step 7:** Draw the cheese and add a few small circles inside.

**Step 8:** Also include the facial features by drawing the inside of the nose, eyebrows, eyes, and whiskers.

**Step 9:**

**●** Draw his fingers and hair between his ears.

**●** Trace your pencil lines with a sharpie.

**●** Erase the pencil afterward.

Step 10: Finally, you can color your drawing and upload it to your website.

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

![how to draw with colour 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-6.jpg)

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

## How to Create a Whiteboard Video Step by Step

# How to Create a Whiteboard Video Step by Step

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

Drawings will always have a special place in storytelling. Whether you are demonstrating a new concept to a child, highlighting the features of a product to your bosses, or showcasing the intricacies of a marketing campaign, drawings make it easier for the audience to understand what is being said.

That is why it is so important to learn how to **create whiteboard animation**. When you learn how to create a whiteboard video with **[animate pictures app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, you are in a unique position when it comes to selling your story, and convincing others of what you already know.

* [**Part1: What is Whiteboard Animation Video?**](#part1)
* [**Part2: How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation**](#part3)

## Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?

To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.

Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using [2D animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.

When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.

To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.

## Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?

#### Step 1: Write a Script

Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.

It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/write-a-script.JPG)

#### Step 2: Start with the Storyboard

Now you have a script. You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.

When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboard.JPG)

#### Step 3: Create Images

If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.

![create image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-image.JPG)

#### Step 4: Animate Those Images

Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.

![animate drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-drawing.JPG)

#### Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio

The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.

![audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-audio.JPG)

## Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation

#### Evoke Empathy

The goal of a whiteboard animation video is not just to explain information in a cold and impersonal way. You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.

By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.

#### Personalize the Images

Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.

## Conclusion

Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project. And if you are wondering how you will edit your video, we recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use it to make animation video by adding keyframes, so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation. Besides, color correction and audio mixer will raise up your explainer video to a new level. Download it to have a try (Free)!

When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.

#### Step 3: Create Images

If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.

#### Step 4: Animate Those Images

Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.

#### Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio

The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.

## Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation

#### Evoke Empathy

The goal of a whiteboard animation video is not just to explain information in a cold and impersonal way. You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.

By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.

#### Personalize the Images

Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.

## Conclusion

Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project. And if you are wondering how you will edit your video, we recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use it to make animation video by adding keyframes, so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation. Besides, color correction and audio mixer will raise up your explainer video to a new level. Download it to have a try (Free)!

* [**Part3: Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation**](#part3)

## Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?

To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.

Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using [2D animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.

When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.

To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.

## Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?

#### Step 1: Write a Script

Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.

It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.
