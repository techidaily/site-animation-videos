### 02**PicMonkey**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.4/5**\]**

When it comes to **online photo animator** tools, PicMonkey is definitely one of the first that people recommend. It’s premium software, so you’ll have to pay to use all of its functions — with the cheapest plan worth $72 annually or $7.99 monthly. The best part about it is, undoubtedly, the fact that it was developed by Shutterstock, which is highly regarded in the photography industry. So, you can surely rely on stable support.

### 03**Adobe Creative Cloud Express**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Creative Bloq: 4/5\]

The Adobe Creative Cloud Express is both an **online photo animator** and an application that you can download and install on your phone. As is expected from any Adobe product, it’s quite premium in make and is better suited for more serious photo animations — especially as you’ll need to pay in order to be able to use it to its fullest extent.

### 04**ColorCinch**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[Crozdesk: 4/5\]

ColorCinch, or Cartoonize, as it is also called, is another popular **online photo animator** that you might have heard about already. This one features quite a few presets that you can use to quickly change the look of your photographs.

### 05**Photo Cartoon**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

Photo Cartoon is an **online photo animator** that specifically alters your photos and ‘cartoon-izes’ it (with several effects to choose from as to the specific style that you want).

### 06**BeFunky**

**Rating and Reviews:** \[G2: 4.2/5\]

With BeFunky, we go back to somewhat more advanced **online photo animator** tools. This one works quite simply as well though.

### 07**7\. ASPOSE**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

Although not very well-known, ASPOSE is an easy way of animating pictures online. All you really have to do is upload your file (in the way that is suggested) and you're good to go.

### 08**TheCartoonist.me**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

We’re approaching more and more obscure territory the further we go along this list, with many of the tools, including this next one, called ‘The Cartoonist.me’, not having been rated by the usual tech websites. But, that doesn’t mean that the tool itself is any less useful. This one, in particular, is akin to the other cartoon-izers that we introduced earlier — in that it changes the look of photographs into one similar to what is used in animations.

**●** **Picture animator online** that allows you to turn your pictures into cartoon versions of their former self.

### 09**Snapstouch**

**Rating and Reviews:** N/A

Snapstouch is another obscure, but no less useful, photo editing tool that adds a touch animation to your photographs. This online tool offers sketch, painting, pencil sketch, outline, cartoon, and many other filters that you can apply to your photographs to directly change their look.

## Part 1 How Does Clay Animation Work?

**Claymation** sculptures originate from blobs of clay. Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. **Clay animation** not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.

**Clay animation** also uses stop- motion animation. It includes capturing minute movements and of models to make it look like the characters is acting on their own.
