There's no arguing the fact that Blender is a remarkable tool for 3D animations. Its worldwide popularity is clear proof of what one can achieve while creating a 3D animation with Blender. But, the real question is - are Blender 2D animations as good as their 3D alternatives. Well, the answer is Yes! Blender has a built-in feature known as Grease Pencil that's specifically designed to create 2D animations. With Grease Pencil, you can create different 2D layouts from scratch and turn them into visually appealing animations to engage the potential viewers.

## Part 2 How to Mix 2D & 3D Animation in Blender?

So, how can you create 2D animations in Blender? Well, it depends! The process to create a 2D animation in Blender mainly depends on what you want to design. You can find different Blender 2D animation tutorials on YouTube and use them to get started with 2D animations in Blender. But, we would like to point out that there's a generic process that'll remain consistent in every situation. If you are also getting started with creating 2D animations in Blender, here's the step-by-step process that'll help you start sailing in the right direction and make the 2D animation designing a hassle-free task.

##### Step 1

First and foremost, launch Blender on your system and set it up to get started. On the home screen, click on "File>New" and then, select "2D Animation".

If the lighting is right, the subjects look more stunning and the overall frame becomes visually engaging. If you also want to know how to use lighting in a 2D animation, this 19-minutes long video is your answer.

### 3\. Blender Fundamentals

If you are an absolute beginner, it would be better to first familiarize yourself with different elements of the software. Without knowing what a particular tool can do, you'll most likely struggle to pour your creativity into the Blender 2D animation. So, before working on your first 2D animation, make sure to take your time to go through these Blender 2D animation tutorials uploaded by the tech giant itself.

Keep in mind that it's not a single video, but a series of episodes that'll walk you through the basics of Blender and how to start with your first 2D/3D animation. If you are serious about working with Blender, this series is your one-stop solution to get familiar with the application.

![Animated Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-02.jpg)

## Part 2 How Do You Draw a Cartoon Character for Beginners?

Even cartoon painting experts were once beginners. So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let's get started.

### 01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character

**These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:**

##### Step 1Start with the face

The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.

After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.

![start with face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-06.jpg)

##### Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing

Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.

Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.

![Draw the eyes by drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-07.jpg)

##### Step 3Draw eyebrows

On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.

![draw eyebrows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-08.jpg)

##### Step 4Draw jaw

After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.

![draw jaw](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-09.jpg)

##### Step 5Draw nose

Design the nose and ensure that you don't put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.

![Draw nose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-10.jpg)

##### Step 6Draw mouth

Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.

![Draw mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-11.jpg)

##### Step 7Draw ears

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

![Draw ears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg)

##### Step 8Draw haircut

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.

Nevertheless, please don't take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.

So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that's not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.

![draw haircut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-13.jpg)

### 02 Cartoon Paintings of an Old Character

**If you want your character to look old, this is the way to go:**

##### Step 1Old character draw a face

The face is no different from that of a young character. Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don't forget to add wrinkles.

Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.

![Old character draw face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-14.jpg)

##### Step 2Old character make the chin

Make the chin longer too.

![Old character make chin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-15.jpg)

##### Step 3Old character draw the nose

Ensure that the nose design looks wider and larger since the character is old. To achieve that, make the nose look close to the eyes

![Old character draw nose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-16.jpg)

##### Step 4Old character exaggerates mustache

Skip the mouth bit and instead go for a big, exaggerated mustache. That's one common characteristic of an old character, especially male.

![Old character exaggerate mustache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-17.jpg)

##### Step 5Draw hair

When it comes to hair, bald and side hair will play the trick perfectly. The nose is no different from that of a young character.

![draw hair](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-18.jpg)

### 03 Cartoon Painting of a Female Character

So far, our focus has been on a male character. So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.

The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women's facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.

![female character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-19.jpg)

As far as good cartoons are concerned, expect about 5 popular types. These **cartoons to draw** include:

### 01 Illustrative Cartoons

They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.

The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.

It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.

![illustrative cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-01.jpg)

### 02 Animated Cartoons

It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.

As much as that's how they seem from the viewer's perspective, that's far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.

![Animated Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-02.jpg)

### 03 Comic Strips or Panels

In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.

Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.

The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.

![Comic Strips or Panels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-03.jpg)

### 04 Gag Cartoons

As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.

Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that's often a single sentence.

![Gag Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-04.jpg)

Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn't be easier. A lot of the 'whiteboard animation' generators also work as **blackboard animation** generators.

In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.

01 [Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?](#Part 1)

02 [How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?**

**Blackboard animation** some may say is as outdated as the concept of 'blackboards' themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.

However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, **chalkboard animation** is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it's just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you're looking for — especially if you're looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)

![Traditional Blackboard with Chalk](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation1.png)

## Part 2 **How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?**

But alright, so how do you make it so that your **blackboard animation** is just as suited for the modern generation as it is for the older generation?? Well, that's easy really. You'll need images Or, rather, you'll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with **chalkboard animation**.

With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your **chalkboard animation video** and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.

![Black Blackboard and Drawing Pencils](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation2.png)

## Part 3 **How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?**

Alright, so onto actually talking about how you can go about creating a **chalkboard animation video** Take note, this is going to be an 'overview' kind of tutorial. We've also decided to choose a more 'custom' method, rather than using one of the premium **blackboard animation** generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)

### 01Step 1\. Pick Your Software

The first step in creating **chalkboard animation** is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more 'animation-specific', like After Effects. Or something more 'video-editing-specific' like Filmora.

Again, because this is meant to be more of a 'general' tutorial, we won't be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your **blackboard animation** videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project

![Filmora - Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation3.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Create a Storyboard**

Next, to make the actual **blackboard animation** creation process go smoother, it's important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create

The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don't necessarily have to draw every single frame of your **chalkboard animation** beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won't have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future

![Blackboard Animation - Storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation4.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Draw Characters**

For this step, we say 'characters' and use the word 'draw.' But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you'll need for each scene (if not each frame)

If you're not the 'drawing' type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you're really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind

![Prepare Characters for Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation5.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Put Together Project**

Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That's also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go

In the image below, we're only showing the start of a potential project. We've only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video

![Use Software to Create Blackboard Animation Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation6.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes **blackboard animation** videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you're doing it to promote your services/goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another

**●** Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn't make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals

**●** In our brief 'overview' tutorial, we expand on the subject of **blackboard animation** some more. Be warned, it's not the kind of project you should go into if you're not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.

**●** Still, there's something satisfying about a well-done **chalkboard animation video** that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.

03 [How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?**

**Blackboard animation** some may say is as outdated as the concept of 'blackboards' themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.

However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, **chalkboard animation** is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it's just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you're looking for — especially if you're looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)

## Part 2 **How to Combine Modern Needs with Blackboard Animation?**

But alright, so how do you make it so that your **blackboard animation** is just as suited for the modern generation as it is for the older generation?? Well, that's easy really. You'll need images Or, rather, you'll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with **chalkboard animation**.

With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your **chalkboard animation video** and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.

## Part 3 **How to Create a Blackboard Animation in ONE DAY?**

Alright, so onto actually talking about how you can go about creating a **chalkboard animation video** Take note, this is going to be an 'overview' kind of tutorial. We've also decided to choose a more 'custom' method, rather than using one of the premium **blackboard animation** generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)

### 01Step 1\. Pick Your Software

The first step in creating **chalkboard animation** is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more 'animation-specific', like After Effects. Or something more 'video-editing-specific' like Filmora.

Again, because this is meant to be more of a 'general' tutorial, we won't be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your **blackboard animation** videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project

![Filmora - Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation3.png)

### 02**Step 2\. Create a Storyboard**

Next, to make the actual **blackboard animation** creation process go smoother, it's important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create

The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don't necessarily have to draw every single frame of your **chalkboard animation** beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won't have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future

![Blackboard Animation - Storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation4.png)

### 03**Step 3\. Draw Characters**

For this step, we say 'characters' and use the word 'draw.' But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you'll need for each scene (if not each frame)

If you're not the 'drawing' type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you're really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind

![Prepare Characters for Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/dead-simple-guide-to-create-new-and-exciting-blackboard-animation5.png)

### 04**Step 4\. Put Together Project**

Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That's also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go

In the image below, we're only showing the start of a potential project. We've only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes **blackboard animation** videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you're doing it to promote your services/goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another

**●** Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn't make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals

**●** In our brief 'overview' tutorial, we expand on the subject of **blackboard animation** some more. Be warned, it's not the kind of project you should go into if you're not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.

**●** Still, there's something satisfying about a well-done **chalkboard animation video** that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.

Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn't be easier. A lot of the 'whiteboard animation' generators also work as **blackboard animation** generators.
