This is additionally beneficial for the recruiting agencies as well, who get the maximum fruit with the least effort.

## Part 2 **What Are the Specs & Dimensions of LinkedIn Slideshow?**

Now that you are familiar with the credibility of a LinkedIn carousel post in the professional world, let us get into some more details of the utility with proceeding towards a discussion of the different specifications and dimensions of a **LinkedIn slideshow** and the professional aspects of the same in the following section:

**●** Take Care of the File Size

The credibility of LinkedIn carousel posts lies in the engaging presentation of your static and monotonous text to make them stand out of the crowded newsfeed. True that your creative skills are sufficient enough to design a graphic masterpiece, yet you should take care to remain within an affordable limit, lest you would end up with a large file that gets difficult to upload and process. Most reliably, a 100 MB file size would easily fit into the bill.

**●** Restrict Your Slide Count

When creating a **slideshow LinkedIn** presentation, it is normal to get a bit over the line while including the most exemplary and comprehensive details about your professional qualifications, skills and background. Relax, that’s nothing wrong! However, all you need to care about is limiting the slide count of your slideshow to a maximum of 300 pages. As a genuine approach, no one would bother going beyond that to read about you anyway!

**●** Use a Commendable File Format

You would ideally want the documents and media files in your slideshow to have the finest quality. LinkedIn allows you to create and share your graphic presentations in the PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX and PPT file formats. If you want the assurance of your slideshows having the highest resolution and appreciable output quality, it is recommended to save them in the PDF file format.

**●** Make a Careful Upload

When you are ready to upload your presentation, consider taking a close preview of its contents to make sure that you have not missed out on anything. This becomes all the more necessary, owing to the fact that, you are not allowed to edit your post in anyway after it gets uploaded on your LinkedIn profile.

**●** Bonus Tip

To include the latest and up-to-date information within your presentation, consider visiting the LinkedIn official webpage directly from your platform account.

## Part 3 **Examples of LinkedIn Slideshow**

Creating a **LinkedIn slide show** can be both, exciting as well as advantageous on the professional front.

Opening his work profile, you would firstly get to see an infographic PDF export, which are later uploaded as document files on a LinkedIn post that speaks in favor of the statistics.

**●** **Share Action Oriented Business Modules**
