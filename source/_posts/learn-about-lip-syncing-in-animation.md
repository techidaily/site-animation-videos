02 [Best 12 Illusion Gifs](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What Is GIF Illustration?

GIFs are a form of digital media that is used to show animations and other types of visuals. It is a type of file format that can be created with different editing software. These are usually used for short videos or images on the internet and social media.

Furthermore, GIFs are an excellent way to create visual content for social media posts or as an animated overlay on a video.

These are now used as everything from advertisements to commentary from all walks of life. The users of GIFs seem to be endless! They can be used in many different ways, such as to add visual interest, provide context or even humor, and so on. It is totally on the user how they are considering it to make the things more relevant to the context for which they have created or shared the GIF.

## Part 2 Best 12 Illusion Gifs

This curated list will help you to know the best **Illusion GIF** that is still ruling out the market. This includes:-

### 01Van Gogh Stare GIF

The Van Gogh Stare, also known as the "dazzle camouflage," is an optical illusion created by artist Vincent van Gogh. It was likely intended to represent the eye's instability and movement. The image has been used in a variety of ways, including on social media sites like Tumblr. In general, this GIF illusion is a demonstration of the Van Gogh Stare.

### 02This brain-busting rotation

We are all used to seeing the world around us in two dimensions. But what if we could see it in three dimensions? Well, now you can! This GIF shows a rotating 3D object that appears to be made of cubes. The illusion is created by the fact that the camera rotates around the object, but you can't see it from every angle.

### 03This loop tea GIF

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how our brain works. When we see something that doesn't make sense, we try to make sense of it by filling in the gaps with what we believe it should look like. The GIF illusion consists of two frames. The first frame shows a woman drinking tea from a cup, and the second frame shows her drinking from an empty cup. When our brain tries to fill in the gaps, it assumes that the woman drank all of the tea and sees her as drinking from an empty cup even though she is actually drinking from a full one.

### 04No smkoing! Well, you should never

The GIF illusion consists of two images: one of a cloud and another of cauliflower. The animation starts with the cloud and then switches to the cauliflower. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYIYM1nevhrtjKE)

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/illusion-optics-commercialat-awj9yWMUq54BHHyDJj)

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

[via GIPHY](https://giphy.com/gifs/xmdofp-tON0RAUE9e9Ik)

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that there's actually no smoke in the first image, just the cauliflower. And it's not really a head either - it's just an ordinary cauliflower from behind.

The reason why this illusion works is that our brains are wired to see patterns and shapes in things that aren't always there - for example, when we see faces in random objects or shapes in clouds. This GIF takes advantage of that by showing two images where these are

### 05The never-ending corridor

The GIF illusion is a rather simple illusion that takes advantage of the way our brains perceive motion. Our brains are programmed to see a moving object as a single object in order to make sense of the world around us. This means that when we see an object moving, we perceive it as one solid thing instead of many separate objects.

This GIF illusion is a perfect example of how the human brain works. The brain can't process that the two images are different, and instead, it sees them as a single image.

### 06Now, this, the eye-pleaser

The illusion works on the principle of depth perception and how our eyes are not able to accurately process all of the information that they receive from our surroundings. The black lines on the white background make it seem like there are two rows of lines, but there's only one row that appears to be moving back and forth.

### 07Commercial At design GIF

The GIF illusion is a simple design that tricks the brain into thinking that it is 3D. The design consists of two circles, one inside the other, with three arrows pointing inwards. The outside circle has a white background and the inside circle has a black background. When you look at this design from different angles, you will see that the arrows point outwards and not inwards as they should be doing.

### 08Wait what? Is this truly a reflection?

This illusion works because our brain recognizes that the mirror image is not what's really happening and flips the image in our head to make it right-side up.

It's also possible that we are tricked by the fact that we know mirrors flip images, so when we see an upside-down image in front of us, we automatically assume it's just inverted.

### 09This haunting tableau (Not exactly a GIF but worth sharing)

The GIF illusion is a type of optical illusion that can be explained by the Gestalt Principles. The Gestalt Principles are guidelines for how we perceive and organize visual information. This optical illusion is created by overlapping two similar images on top of each other in the same place but with different colors. Our brain perceives this as a single image, and our eyes try to make sense of it by looking for visual cues in the image. When we focus on one image, it looks like a triangle with a red line going through it. But when we focus on the other image, it looks like an arrow pointing up that has been cut in half with a red line through it.

### 10This safety hazard

This GIF illusion is a safety hazard because it tricks the brain into thinking that the person in front of them is standing still. When you stare at this GIF for too long, the person will appear to be moving backward. This illusion can cause accidents if you believe that a person is still when they are actually approaching you.

### 11Welcome to the 3d World

It's an illusion created by the use of perspective. The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

The camera is positioned in such a way that it appears that the three-dimensional cube is only two-dimensional.

### 12I will keep this table forever

The GIF illusion is an optical illusion that makes the table in the background appear to be bigger than it actually is. The table in front of the window appears to be smaller and closer to the viewer. There are two factors that make this illusion happen. One of them is perspective, which makes objects appear larger as they get closer and smaller as they get farther away. The other factor is size constancy, which makes objects look about the same size regardless of how far away they are from you.

Blender is a FREE, open-source 3D Animation program that is very popular for beginner animators. It's a good way of starting if you're not yet sure about how far you want to go into animation as it won't demand any immediate monetary commitment.

Now, as for its features, today, we'll be focusing on **Blender Rigging** features.

#### In this article

01 [Why Use Blender Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]](#Part 2)

03 [Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **Why Use Blender Rigging?**

**Blender Character Rigging** is a great way of creating truly beautiful and realistic animations. Despite being an open-source program, it's capable of doing just as much, if not more, than some of the more premium Animation software out there.

So, if you want to create video projects for your audience's entertainment or edification with animation, then **Blender Rigging** is definitely something that you should consider. With this tool, you can create the complex animations that you need and then polish it up in a video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is a premium, video-editing tool that you can use to perfect your finished **Blender Rigging** animations.)

![Blender Character Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes1.png)

## Part 2 **The Art of Effective Rigging in Blender \[TUTORIAL\]**

For this next section, we're going to be introducing a couple of tutorials that you can look into to teach you more about **Blender Character Rigging**, **Blender Facial Rigging**, **Blender Muscle Rig**, and so on.

These topics are each very long-winded on their own though, so we've linked appropriate video tutorials that you can learn more and reserved ourselves to a brief description of each technique so that you can determine whether it's something that interests you (although, of course, our recommendation is that you check each one out so that you can get the full ‘Blender' experience.)

### 01**Blender Character Rigging**

The main thing people usually look at Blender for is, **Blender Character Rigging**. And, because it was created to emulate professional animation software, Blender has this function down to pat. To give you an idea of what features you can expect: Blender comes with custom bone shapes for easy **Blender character rigging**, it also comes with envelope skinny, skeleton skinning, and automatic skinning. With these alone, you can be assured that you will be able to create complex animations without much trouble.

### 02**Blender Facial Rigging**

Facial Rigging is usually a more complex subject that is avoided by animators without much experience. But, with Blender, facial rigging is possible. The YouTube video should show you the process of going about **Blender Facial Rigging** from start to finish (from sculpting the character face itself and then making use of **Blender Rigging** tools for setting up a skeletal structure for your face's character to become animated.)

### 03**Blender Muscle Rigging**

Creating a **Blender Muscle Rig** is exactly what it sounds like. It is, of course, much more complicated than normal rigging, but it is a good subject to familiarize yourself with anyway, as it will allow you to go to the ‘next stage' as you say, with your Animations. The video that we've attached is from Pierrick Picaut, who has released a series of videos on the subject of **Blender Rigging** in general and has extensively explained how to create a **Blender Human Rig** from the general body, the face, the muscles, and so on.

### 04**Blender Rigging**

Although a lot of Animation relies on more ‘traditional' methods of expressing movement, one can still make use of more modern animation practices, like rigs, to set up their animations for movement. It's an especially good skill to learn if you're more interested in content-friendly animations (rather than creating a film of your own.)

### 05**Blender Rigging**

This next tutorial is an introduction to basic **Blender Rigging**. It's a good one to both start and end on, as it was created for beginners specifically, and uses an example that is perhaps easier to understand most. Make sure to give it a shot just in case.

## Part 3 **Introduction to Rigging in Blender Course**

For this next part, we introduce two other resources that you can take advantage of to learn more about **Blender Rigging**. Whether it be about **Blender character rigging**, **Blender facial rigging**, **free blender rigs, creating muscle rigs**, and so and so forth. These resources have got your back.

### 01**Where to Learn the Course?**

The first major course that we think you might be interested in is Mark Masters' **blender rigging** course. You can find this course at PluralSight (which is a website that is focused on helping users of software develop their skills). Mark Masters, the instructor for this course, is a professional animator and works as a Animator for the animation studio, Steelhouse Productions. So, you can be sure that there is much that you can learn from him.

### 02**Other Tools to Learn Rigging**

As for other places to learn? We suggest the "Blender Fundamentals" course that Blender themselves have posted on YouTube. They have several of these courses (for all of the more recent versions of Blender). So, you can pick out a course that works for you. One of their more recent series is "Blender Fundamentals 2.which currently has videos all on the subject of **Blender rigging** (including **Blender rigging** and **Blender rigging** videos.)

![Blender Fundamentals on YouTube. By Blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-simple-blender-rigging-in-only-2-minutes3.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in trying out **blender rigging** yourself, you'll probably want to study the subject a little before beginning.

**●** Blender Rigging is quite a complex subject for beginners but having something to start with should help you on your way.

**●** For that, we recommend checking out the videos that we mentioned in section two of this article, where we recommend some popular tutorials regarding some of the more common **Blender Rigging** subjects.

**●** If you're looking for something more comprehensive or put together though. A course might be more up to your taste. For that, we recommend either Mark Master's introduction to rigging and animation over at PluralSight or Blender's own "Blender Fundamental" series on YouTube (which should introduce all the functions you'll need to know.)

Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

![2d animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3danimation-01.jpeg)

animations are like the ones Dreamworks, Pixar, produce. They include the avengers, the bad guys, etc.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.

Before you delve into the profession of creating **3d cartoon filters**, you need to understand or decide if creating animated characters is something you would like to do. It's not going to be smooth as you will get frustrated at some point, you will get confused, and it will be challenging, but in the end, it is rewarding because it is an expression of your mind coming to life. You are the one to breathe life into your characters who represent your imaginations. You will also have to infuse a great deal of your creativity to create beautiful and exciting characters for others to enjoy. Meanwhile, let's first understand what 3d animations mean.

Becoming a 3d animator is not a feat you can achieve in a short time. It is not days, weeks, months, or even years. Like any other profession, a professional 3d animator must have put in a great deal of work, mixed with a lot of passion and love for what he is doing. To become successful as a 3d animator, you must love what you are doing or be ready to put in the work.

This article will expose what you should learn to create beautiful **3d animation cartoons**, including what to expect as a 3d animator.

## Part 1 **What Is 3D Animation And The Process of 3D Animation?**

animation is a term that describes the art of creating 3-dimensional images and placing them in a digital environment. It is a process that uses motion to bring objects, characters, etc., to life.

It is also known as computer-generated imagery, and it is currently the most common animation type for feature films.

Various software and programs are designed specifically for 3d animations and allow the animators to bring the objects to life.

The process of 3d animation happens in three(3) stages;

**●** Modeling

**●** Layout and animation

**●** Rendering

Modeling in 3d animation involves generating the objects or characters either by using a modeling tool or using a real thing. The real object is scanned directly into the computer, where other processes follow. You have total control over your character and how you want them to appear by modeling. You decide the weight, specifications, feel, etc. However, scanning objects save a lot of time. You must add texture before modeling your character or reviewing it before moving to the following layout and animation.

Layout and animation stage: A layout is determined when the generated objects move to this stage. It involves creating a set/scene where the objects can position. Layout first happens before animation does. After adding the objects and characters, they get animated using animation variables. After this, you use motion capture or keyframing to give life to the models in the scenes.

Rendering: Rendering is using software or programs. It is not something to do using just your computer. These tools can generate the scenes into the finished image according to the client's requirements or set goals.

Creating **cartoon background images** or any other form of **animations** is a process that requires a lot of planning and work, which sums up a lot of time. To learn 3d animation, you must be ready to give in ample time as it is a profession that requires some time to handle.

The process listed above also shows the creativity requirement required to succeed in the 3d animation industry. To think that you must create the scenes, which is the layout stage, means you have to be creative in your imagination. If you then decide to model your character from scratch using modeling tools. That also requires another job of thinking and extracting a lot of your creative juices.

## Part 2 **What is the difference between 2d animation and 3d animation?**

Anyone can decide to learn animation with no plan in mind or understanding of what the profession involves. **animation** is different from 2d animation, and if you want to learn **animation,** you need to understand the distinction between these two.

animation can have a lot of creative possibilities, whereas 3d animation has a lot of natural abilities. The visual style of both types of animation is explicitly different.

**3d** animation is a more intensive technical process than the various stages mentioned earlier. It would most likely involve different specialists to handle them to get a more professional output. However, 2d animation consists of drawing the characters frame by frame.

animated cartoons are in The Simpsons, Pinocchio, the Lion king, etc.

![2d animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3danimation-01.jpeg)

animations are like the ones Dreamworks, Pixar, produce. They include the avengers, the bad guys, etc.

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

## Part 4 **Top Three (3) 3d Animation Making Mistakes To Avoid**

![3d animation mistakes?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/before-you-learn-3d-animation-05.jpeg)

As we initially mentioned, 3d animation requires an intensive technical process. It is a skill that you need to hone over the years by paying attention to detail, being highly creative, and daring to succeed.

Here are 3 mistakes you must avoid during the **animation** process;

**●** Forgetting the 'why' factor

**●** Over-animating a scene

**●** Not giving your viewers time to take it in

**Forgetting the why:**  In a **animation cartoon,** every move, walking step, and smile is essential. Every character represented in your **cartoon background** is there for a specific reason.

You would be making a mistake that will affect the result if you lose focus on this reason. Your viewers won't find your cartoon believable if the moves and acting don't add up.

Your characters don't just move because they want to move. Something must have spurred the motion or reaction. It could be for what happened to them, what they heard, or saw another character did in the scene. Do not neglect the why of the act.

While animating, focus on why and keep revisiting until all your characters and objects are knitted closely together.

**Over-animating a scene:** This is another mistake animators should avoid. If you animate your characters, everything may be a mess if you animate the background and foreground. Simplicity is how to get this thing, keep it simple and focused.

Do not have much going on in each scene but only where you need the attention of your viewers. Animators that do this end up confusing their viewers with no direction.

You can use camera effects such as depth of field to make your audience focus on the point you are trying to make in the particular scene.

**Not giving your viewers time to take it in:** This is another 3d animation making a mistake you should be careful of. Not giving your viewers time to process the happenings on the scene before the next.

This can be avoided by timing and measuring cuts such that any animation at the start of a new scene is timed to enable the viewers to take it in. You can ask for third-party criticism on your work to find out how your animation is received and see pointers to mistakes such as this. The third party could be your colleague or friend.

**Note:** You can easily avoid any error or mistake or modify your 3D animation with the help of the Wondershare Filmora video editor. That will provide a solid base for featuring 3D animation.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** 3D animation refers to using motion to breathe life into inanimate objects, and they can create animated videos and **animation cartoons.**

**●** 3D animation is highly technical, unlike 2d animation

**●** You can avoid the above 3d mistakes if you remain objective and open, and ready to accept constructive criticism.

**●** Becoming an animator is a fun thing to do, and it allows you to be free to express your creativity while entertaining other people entirely.

**●** Before you start learning 3d animation and create **cartoon photos,** ensure that you have read through all that we have explained here to have good information about what you are going into.
