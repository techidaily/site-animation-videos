### 4\. Make a GIF

![make a gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/web-text-gif-5.jpg)

Make A GIF allows you to create a GIF from many images, a video from your computer, a Facebook or YouTube video, or directly from your webcam.

With this tool, it's pretty simple to customize the order of the photos and rearrange them via drag-and-drop editor. You can also resize its images and create a personalized animation speed. In addition, there is a captioning tool included to add text on top of your GIF, but you can't preview it before creating the GIF or change where the text GIF maker is displayed.

You can save the GIF to your PC and copy its URL to find it online once created. It further consists of options for making your GIF public, private, or unlisted. You can even link directly to the GIF file.

### 5\. ImgFlip

Besides, you can alter animation delay, width, height, photo order, and quality for a GIF created with images. There's also a crop option, text tool, and the ability to rotate the GIF, change the play count, reverse it, and change the background color.

You can download your GIF and share it over a few social media sites once done, or not post it online while setting it as private.
