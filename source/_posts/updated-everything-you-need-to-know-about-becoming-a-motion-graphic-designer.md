04 [Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well!

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

## Part 1 **What is the Most Realistic Sounding Text to Speech & How to Do It?**

To start off, we've included this little second on need-to-know information regarding text-to-speech. Starting with:

### 01How did text to speech get popular?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text-to-speech function was developed to increase accessibility for those who have trouble reading on screen-text. Either as a result of visual impairment, are blindness. However, with its emergence came popular programs like Audible, which introduced even those without accessibility problems to its convenience for multi-tasking purposes.

### 02How to get the most realistic sounding text to speech?

There are several ways you can increase the natural sound of your text-to-speech:

**●** You can choose a tone that suits your taste.

**●** You can choose a voice gender that you are more comfortable with.

**●** And you can increase the speed of the text to reduce the awkward, and unnatural pauses that occur after each word.

In the end, though, the best way to get realistic speech is to find a tool that offers high-quality audio options. Which is what we'll be introducing in the latter sections:

## Part 2 How to Make Your Own Text to Speech Videos for YouTube

If you want to create your own **anime text-to-speech** for your YouTube videos (which is popular with a lot of YouTubers these days), the process is about the same no matter what text-to-speech option you end up choosing in the end. For our examples below, we will be using Natural Readers though, which is a FREE tool, making it a good choice for those who are just looking to try it out.

**Step 1: Compose Your Text**

The first step is to compose your text! You might prefer to do this on Google Docs or Word, but a lot of text-to-speech tools do offer you a way of composing your text along with them (like the online tool Natural Readers):

![Natural Readers - Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers1.png)

**Step 2: Choose Voice / Reader**

Next, it's time to choose the reader that you want your text to be read by!

Usually, there are options for different types of accents and languages offered. So, if you want your text to speech to match that of your desired anime characters, you should play around with these options to get the right one.

![Natural Readers - Readers Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers2.png)

**Step 3: Choose Reading Speed!**

Next, it's time to choose your desired reading speed!

Most readers start off at 1X speed on average, but we personally recommend going for at least 1.25X - 1.5X for an instantly more natural-sounding text-to-speech anime characters.

![Natural Readers - Reading Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers3.png)

**Step 4: Choose Output Format**

And finally, to finish us off, it's time to choose what output format you want your text-to-speech audio to be! To keep this simple for uploading to YouTube, we recommend sticking with MP3, which most editors accept.

![Natural Readers - Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers4.png)

## Part 3 **How to Get More Voices for Text to Speech?**

If you think that the available **cartoon characters text-to-speech** voices you have are not quite doing it for your project, then you can always explore alternative, third-party options! There are many of these available. Although, you'll have to check with your text-to-speech reader or maker to make sure that it allows for such a feat:

### 01Method 1: Windows Text-to-Speech Voices

If you're looking to change your computer's text-to-speech voice, then the place to look for this is on ‘Control Panel > Speech'. There, not only can you choose from a variety of different voice options, but you can also change voice speed and voice pitch (how high or low the pitch is), which is a great way of getting a very specific kind of tone for your **anime text-to-speech** creations.

![Speech Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers5.png)

### 02Method 2: Third-Party Voices (Screaming Bee)

Next is the third-party resource, [Screaming Bee](https://screamingbee.com/Docs/scriptvox/ScriptVOXMoreTextToSpeechVoices), which offers a good variety of text-to-speech voices that you can try out as well! Using this method will, of course, require downloading and applying these voices for your chosen text-to-speech reader. For example, if you want to use the Windows reader, go to the Control Panel > Speech page for the option to apply it there.

![Text to Speech Voices Download Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers6.png)

### 03Method 3: Third-Party Voices (Cepstral Voices)

Another resource that you can check out is [Cepstral Voices](https://www.cepstral.com/en/demos). Just like Screaming Bee, it offers a range of text-to-speech voices that you can try out to see which one suits your taste most. This includes **text-to-speech cartoon characters** and **text-to-speech anime characters** voices!

![Cepstral Voices - Demo Voices Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers7.png)

## Part 4 **Top 5 Tips on Anime Text to Speech**

Now, onto some more **anime text-to-speech** options that you can try in order to make your text-to-speech script sound exactly like your favorite cartoon or anime characters! For this list, we've not only included a description of each reader but also why you might want to try it out:

### 01Flixier

Flixier is the first **anime text-to-speech** maker on this list! It is not a free solution. You can try it out for FREE, but if you want to use it for its full capacity, then you'll need to pay for one of their subscription packages, which start at $10 per month (for access to longer audios, unlimited projects, and more advanced export options.)

**●** Flixier comes with many different voice options.

**●** It is an online tool, so no download or installation is required.

**●** It comes with advanced team functionalities.

![Flixier Online Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers8.png)

### 02Woord

Woord is our next pick because it works very efficiently at turning text into speech. All you need to do is plug in your text and it will convert it immediately! Much like Flixier, however, it is a freemium tool. So, while you can try it out for free, if you truly want to use it for creating professional projects, you'll need to unlock one of its subscription packages (which start at $25 per month!)

**●** Instant text-to-speech maker.

**●** An online tool, no need for download or installation.

**●** Lots of natural-sounding voices to choose from.

![Woord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers9.png)

### 03Speechelo

Speechelo is a bit different from the two text-to-speech makers on this list. However, that may just mean that it is a more preferable option for some. More specifically, it's really more of a ‘voice-over-maker'. It does still use AI in order to create human-like voiceovers, with several different options to voice and language. The difference then lies in the fact that it is a one-time payment software that normally costs around $100\. In this way, you can avoid long-term ongoing subscription plans. But it is a heavier commitment from the get-go.

**●** High-quality AI voices for creating realistic voice-overs.

**●** One-time payment only! No Subscription fees are needed.

**●** Works in several different languages.

![Speechelo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers10.png)

### 04Cartoon Animator 4

Cartoon Animator 4 is a good option if you're really looking for that anime or character style for your audio. It works just like your average text-to-speech maker, generally, although it does also offer a couple of more advanced features for those who are looking into animation.

**●** A wide variety of voice options to choose from.

![Cartoon Animator 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers11.png)

### 05TTS Reader

TTSReader, much like Cartoon Animator 4, is a FREE online tool that you can use in order to create quick and easy text-to-speech audio for your cartoon/anime characters. It doesn't have as many advanced features as some of the other tools out there, but it can get the job done if all you're looking for is something easy to use.

**●** Available to use online for FREE.

**●** Variety of different voice options.

**●** Adjustable speed for voice.

![TTS Reader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/5-foolproof-amazing-anime-text-to-speech-tips-for-makers12.png)

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** If you're looking to increase conversions with better-sounding voiceovers for your video content, then it's important that you're aware of all the different options out there!

**●** Most of these text-to-speech tools work in the same way, but you'll notice that some of them offer more advanced tools than others.

**●** In the end, you'll have to find one that works with your budget and learn how to play around with its settings to make sure that you are getting the most out of your text-to-speech maker.

This was a question one of my friends asked me recently on the subject of **animate rigging**

To help them out (as well as other **animation rigging** beginners) I decided to compile some of the most popular tips on the subject in this article!

#### In this article

01 [The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Animate Rigging?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to Know About Rigging in Animation**

Before anything else, we’ve prepared a bit of an OVERVIEW on rigging in animation. This will cover most of the basic, need-to-know stuff to nudge you in the right direction and help the tips we’ve prepared to settle in more easily.

### 01**What is Rigging in Animation**

Rigging in animation is a technique used by animators to—quite literally—‘rig’ up a statistic digital character to act or move.

Even more simply, it’s a way of bringing literal life to your character models by introducing them to motion. The ‘rig’ in this case, is usually made as a sort of one-size-fits-all kind of tool, which you can use in order to create pre-made skeletal animations that replicate motions like walking, running, jumping, etc., and apply onto static characters. You can use animation software, like [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) in order to get this done!

![AutoDesk Maya Software Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging1.jpg)

### 02**An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging**

2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!

### 03**An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging**

3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.

In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.

### 04**Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving**

Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:

**Joints|Bones**: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.

**Driven Keys**: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).

**Blend Shapes**: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.

**Inverse Kinematics**: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.

**Forward Kinematics**: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.

**Control Curves**: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.

**Constraint**: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.

**Deformers**: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.

**Skinning**: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.

**Weight Planning**: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.

**Facial Rigging**: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.

## Part 2 **How Do You Animate Rigging?**

Now, onto actually talking about how you can start **animate rigging**. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.

### 01**How to Rig a Simple Character**

This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:

**Step 1: Design Your Character**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg)

Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of **animation rigging** you’ll need to work on for that character.

For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!

So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.

**Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg)

When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!

Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.

**Step 3: Connect The Layers!**

It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.

**Step 4: Timing Your Animation**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging4.jpg)

With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions

### 02**Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging**

This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:

Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!

Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.

If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.

![AutoDesk Maya Software Shape Rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging5.jpg)

### 03**How Auto Rig Mapping Works**

Auto-rigging is the use of pre-made rigs in order to simplify the process. The tool automatically maps the areas where the characters and the rig are given the same symbol names and snaps them together to create joints for a motion to be applied.

### 04**How Visual Rig Mapping Works**

Visual mapping is a lot more complicated the auto-rig mapping, so it’s not something you want to jump into immediately. However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:

Manually make connections starting with the joints.

Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.

Motion can then be added to the timeline.

### 05**Finalizing Your Animated Rig**

To finish us off, let’s talk about how you go about publishing your finished product! Of course, even after you have your complex rig completed, there are still other matters to think about in terms of making sure that the video is of quality!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Start off on the right footing by learning the basics of animation! These days, there are more options than ever, with the modern 3D animation rigging style now just as popular as the more classic 2D animation style.

**●** The best way to learn animation rigging is to practice! Structured guides can help you get to the point of almost mastery, but it’s not until you start playing with the tools of your craft that you can truly learn how to create beautiful animations!

**●** Some of the more complex functions of rigging require a lot of patience, so make sure that you always go into your projects with a level-head. And, just to be sure, invest in tools that will help rather than hinder your progress! There are many advanced software out there that can help you improve more easily.

### 02**An Introduction to 2D Animation Rigging**

2D animation is a more back-breaking kind of process. It’s what you see in a lot of older animations — where every frame needs to be drawn in order to allow for the illusion of motion in characters. This is how classics, like Mickey Mouse, are usually produced!

### 03**An Introduction to 3D Animation Rigging**

3D animation, as you can probably guess, is a more modern animation style. You see it in a lot of big blockbuster animated movies these days! Even Disney has since moved onto this style, whereas they were staunch supporters of 2D animation in previous decades. Now, a lot of their major productions, including titles such as “Tangled”, “Frozen”, and “Moana” are 3D animated.

In any case, this is more like what we described earlier — where skeletal ‘rigs’ are applied to static 3D character models to make them move.

### 04**Key 3D Rigging Terms to Get You Moving**

Finally, to make sure that you’re headed in the right direction, here’s a list of some of the more important 3D rigging terms that you’ll need to know:

**Joints|Bones**: This is pretty straightforward, but the Joints or the Bones, in this case, refers to the pieces of the skeletal rig that is used to create movement.

**Driven Keys**: Driven keys are there to help rigging artists make the movement appear more natural faster. It consists of two parts, the driver (which controls the animation) and the driven (the parts controlled by the driver).

**Blend Shapes**: This is an animation tool that riggers used mainly for facial animation (like lip-syncing). Basically, it allows them to blend or morph an existing shape to give it motion.

**Inverse Kinematics**: This is a method of animation that separates a part from the whole. Like how an animator can create motion in the wrist, for example, as a separate entity from the arm.

**Forward Kinematics**: Opposite of the previous style, this one is a method that follows a hierarchical progression.

**Control Curves**: This is a way of manipulating multiple joins in a rig in order to create one flowing movement.

**Constraint**: A way of limiting the positioning of a model or a joint.

**Deformers**: A way of enhancing rigs to produce a more organic model.

**Skinning**: This is the process of adding the 3D mesh to the joints.

**Weight Planning**: This is the process of planning how the weight of an object will affect its 3D mesh and the movement of its joints.

**Facial Rigging**: This is the process of setting up facial animation, similar to how you set up skeletal animation, but far more complex.

## Part 2 **How Do You Animate Rigging?**

Now, onto actually talking about how you can start **animate rigging**. This section will guide you through the process in a way that should hopefully help you while in the process of learning about animation in general.

### 01**How to Rig a Simple Character**

This has been broken down into four distinct stages to make things as simple as possible! It won’t be discussing the tools you use, as there are plenty of tools you can use for animation, just the general process:

**Step 1: Design Your Character**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging2.jpg)

Before you even think about animation, you should start with designing your character (or characters.) This will give you a good basis on what kind of **animation rigging** you’ll need to work on for that character.

For example, for a humanoid character, a general skeletal rigging might be okay. However, for a creature or monster, their joints might be in different areas or they might even have additional joints regular human rigs don’t have!

So, start with a foundation that you can work from to make things easier on yourself.

**Step 2: Start With Rigging Points!**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Character Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging3.jpg)

When you have your character design ready, it’s time to start rigging joints! It’s best to start with the joints and leave the more finicky parts later. Basically, it’s always easier to start with the parts that can create big movements first!

Working on things layer by layer should help make things easier for you as well.

**Step 3: Connect The Layers!**

It’s time to put everything together to create smooth movement! Depending on what tool you’re using, this is usually just as easy as dragging things into place.

**Step 4: Timing Your Animation**

![AutoDesk Maya Software Timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-popular-tips-on-learning-animate-rigging4.jpg)

With the rig in place, the next thing you have to worry about is frame timing. Timing is important for ensuring that there is no break in character motions

### 02**Beginners Tutorial on Shape Rigging**

This one is a little more complicated, and should be improved more by trial and error, but here are a couple of tips that you can follow along with while exploring blend shapes in animation:

Master your sculpting tools first and foremost! The more familiar you are with the shapes that your tools can create, the better!

Symmetrical modeling is one way of making the process go a lot faster! Take advantage of this option to highlight components that you need to be affected in the same way and at the same time.

If symmetrical modeling is not working for you, independent modeling is a great way of making things appear more organic.

### 03**How Auto Rig Mapping Works**

Auto-rigging is the use of pre-made rigs in order to simplify the process. The tool automatically maps the areas where the characters and the rig are given the same symbol names and snaps them together to create joints for a motion to be applied.

### 04**How Visual Rig Mapping Works**

Visual mapping is a lot more complicated the auto-rig mapping, so it’s not something you want to jump into immediately. However, it is a must for animation riggers that work with unique character models. The process usually goes as follows:

Manually make connections starting with the joints.

Applying the skeleton to the rig to complete bones and connections.

Motion can then be added to the timeline.

### 05**Finalizing Your Animated Rig**

To finish us off, let’s talk about how you go about publishing your finished product! Of course, even after you have your complex rig completed, there are still other matters to think about in terms of making sure that the video is of quality!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Start off on the right footing by learning the basics of animation! These days, there are more options than ever, with the modern 3D animation rigging style now just as popular as the more classic 2D animation style.

**●** The best way to learn animation rigging is to practice! Structured guides can help you get to the point of almost mastery, but it’s not until you start playing with the tools of your craft that you can truly learn how to create beautiful animations!

**●** Some of the more complex functions of rigging require a lot of patience, so make sure that you always go into your projects with a level-head. And, just to be sure, invest in tools that will help rather than hinder your progress! There are many advanced software out there that can help you improve more easily.
