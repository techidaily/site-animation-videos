## Part 3 How to Create 3D Animations from a Single Still Image?

### 01Simple steps to create 3d animations from a single still image

When it comes to animation, Adobe is recognized as one of the best tools. Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:

**●** Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.

**●** Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.

**●** Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.

**●** Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called "Repousse". By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space

**●** Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.

## Part 1 What is 3D Image Animate?

3D Image Animate is making a moving scene using just a simple image. It is quite a complicated process and requires high technical skills to achieve a moving animation out of a still image. For your convenience, here we list some of the examples that will make you understand what 3D Image Animate is.

### 01Resuscitate a Person or Object

This first 3D Image Animate example depicts turning a real-life still image of a person and making him move out of that still image. Sounds absurd, right? Well, just look at this example below.

### 02Pan View of Car

This next example shows a still image of a car is turned into a moving scene as if the camera person is shooting a pan view of a parked Car.

### 03Dispersing Elements

Here is another amazing 3D Photo Animate example for you. In this one, you’ll get to see an image that is stacked with several elements, fruits, and veggies (in this case), which get dispersed out of the canvas. Go ahead check it out.

## Part 2 What is 3D Photo Motion?

3D photo motion is basically a contemporary technology that helps us to bring life into the pictures. In simple words, using 3D photo motion and animation tools we can make still images into moving ones. **3D animation photo maker online** offers you several motion templates. You can apply any of the available motion templates to a still image and make it animated. 3D photo motion helps convert 2D images to life like moving 3D images. This can be useful when working with a project that deals with many still images.

## Part 3 How to Create 3D Animations from a Single Still Image?

### 01Simple steps to create 3d animations from a single still image

When it comes to animation, Adobe is recognized as one of the best tools. Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:

**●** Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.

**●** Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.

**●** Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.

**●** Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called "Repousse". By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space

**●** Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.

### 02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life

**3D motion photo animator**

The first tool on the list of **3d photo animators online**is an excellent tool called 3D motion photo Animator. The tool helps to split landscape shots into numerous panels depending on the distance of the object from the camera.
