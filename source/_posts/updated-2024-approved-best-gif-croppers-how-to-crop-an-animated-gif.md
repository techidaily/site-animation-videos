## Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva

Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.

Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.

### 2.1 How to animate text in Canva?

Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to "animate," you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.

In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.

Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.

This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.

Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.

# How to Create a Whiteboard Video Step by Step

Drawings will always have a special place in storytelling. Whether you are demonstrating a new concept to a child, highlighting the features of a product to your bosses, or showcasing the intricacies of a marketing campaign, drawings make it easier for the audience to understand what is being said.

That is why it is so important to learn how to **create whiteboard animation**. When you learn how to create a whiteboard video with **[animate pictures app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, you are in a unique position when it comes to selling your story, and convincing others of what you already know.

* [**Part1: What is Whiteboard Animation Video?**](#part1)
* [**Part2: How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?**](#part2)
* [**Part3: Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation**](#part3)

## Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?

To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.

Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using [2D animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.

When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.

To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.

## Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?

#### Step 1: Write a Script

Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.

It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/write-a-script.JPG)

#### Step 2: Start with the Storyboard

Now you have a script. You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.

When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboard.JPG)

#### Step 3: Create Images

If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.

![create image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-image.JPG)

#### Step 4: Animate Those Images

Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.

![animate drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-drawing.JPG)

#### Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio

The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.

![audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-audio.JPG)

## Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation

#### Evoke Empathy

The goal of a whiteboard animation video is not just to explain information in a cold and impersonal way. You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.

By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.

#### Personalize the Images

Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.

## Conclusion

Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project. And if you are wondering how you will edit your video, we recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use it to make animation video by adding keyframes, so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation. Besides, color correction and audio mixer will raise up your explainer video to a new level. Download it to have a try (Free)!

These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.

To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.

## Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?

#### Step 1: Write a Script

Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.

It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.

![script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/write-a-script.JPG)

#### Step 2: Start with the Storyboard

Now you have a script. You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.

When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.

![storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboard.JPG)

#### Step 3: Create Images

If you are a creative person, you will find this part very easy. It is all about creating fun and unique images that will help convey the information that you want to get across. Try to create memorable images that will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive and interesting you can make those images, the better your end result.

![create image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-image.JPG)

#### Step 4: Animate Those Images

Now you have your images, and it is time to find some coherence between those images and your script. You will have to time the animation for your images as you do not want things lingering on the screen for too long, or being seen for a brief second. It may be a good idea for you to speak out the narration as you are animating the images and timing their animation. It will help you with the timing.

![animate drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-drawing.JPG)

#### Step 5: Record and Sync the Audio

The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration as it helps to explain what is happening in the images that people are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it is perfectly in sync with your content.

## Part 3：Useful Tips for Creating Whiteboard Animation

#### Evoke Empathy

The goal of a whiteboard animation video is not just to explain information in a cold and impersonal way. You are hoping to make a connection with your audience. You want them to care about what you are showcasing. By evoking empathy, you will create the connection that you desire.

By adding emotional references, such as funny, lighthearted, cute or emotional moments, you will find your videos are getting a much better reception from the audience. People can relate to content better when it makes them feel things - especially if those feelings are positive.

#### Personalize the Images

Showing interesting images is a good start. But if you can personalize these images with graphics and color, your storyboard will look even better. Remember that your goal is to get people to stand up and take notice of the content that you are creating.

## Conclusion

Now that we have gone over the entire process of creating a whiteboard animation video, we hope that you are ready to get started on your project. And if you are wondering how you will edit your video, we recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can use it to make animation video by adding keyframes, so the animation will be smooth and natural. You just need to build a white plane to easily start making animation. Besides, color correction and audio mixer will raise up your explainer video to a new level. Download it to have a try (Free)!

To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.

Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using [2D animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
