![cartoon painting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-00.gif)

02 [How Do You Draw a Cartoon Character for Beginners?](#Part 2)

03 [Is There Anything else You Can Do to Draw Cartoons More Quickly?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?

As far as good cartoons are concerned, expect about 5 popular types. These **cartoons to draw** include:

### 01 Illustrative Cartoons

They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.

The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.

It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.

![illustrative cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-01.jpg)

### 02 Animated Cartoons

It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.

As much as that's how they seem from the viewer's perspective, that's far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.

![Animated Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-02.jpg)

### 03 Comic Strips or Panels

In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.

Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.

The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.

![Comic Strips or Panels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-03.jpg)

### 04 Gag Cartoons

As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.

Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that's often a single sentence.

![Gag Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-04.jpg)

### 05 Editorial or Political Cartoons

These cartoons are also made for the newspapers. Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper's editorial comment.

As much as some have captions, that's not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.

![Editorial or Political Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-05.jpg)

## Part 2 How Do You Draw a Cartoon Character for Beginners?

Even cartoon painting experts were once beginners. So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let's get started.

### 01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character

**These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:**

##### Step 1Start with the face

The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.

After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.

![start with face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-06.jpg)

##### Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing

Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.

Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.

![Draw the eyes by drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-07.jpg)

##### Step 3Draw eyebrows

On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.

![draw eyebrows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-08.jpg)

##### Step 4Draw jaw

After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.

![draw jaw](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-09.jpg)

##### Step 5Draw nose

Design the nose and ensure that you don't put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.

![Draw nose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-10.jpg)

##### Step 6Draw mouth

Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.

![Draw mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-11.jpg)

##### Step 7Draw ears

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

![Draw ears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg)

##### Step 8Draw haircut

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.

Nevertheless, please don't take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.

So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that's not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.

![draw haircut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-13.jpg)

### 02 Cartoon Paintings of an Old Character

**If you want your character to look old, this is the way to go:**

##### Step 1Old character draw a face

The face is no different from that of a young character. Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don't forget to add wrinkles.

Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.

![Old character draw face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-14.jpg)

##### Step 2Old character make the chin

Make the chin longer too.

![Old character make chin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-15.jpg)

##### Step 3Old character draw the nose

Ensure that the nose design looks wider and larger since the character is old. To achieve that, make the nose look close to the eyes

![Old character draw nose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-16.jpg)

##### Step 4Old character exaggerates mustache

Skip the mouth bit and instead go for a big, exaggerated mustache. That's one common characteristic of an old character, especially male.

![Old character exaggerate mustache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-17.jpg)

##### Step 5Draw hair

When it comes to hair, bald and side hair will play the trick perfectly. The nose is no different from that of a young character.

![draw hair](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-18.jpg)

### 03 Cartoon Painting of a Female Character

So far, our focus has been on a male character. So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.

The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women's facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.

## Part 2 How Do You Draw a Cartoon Character for Beginners?

### 01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character

**These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:**

##### Step 1Start with the face

The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.

After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.

![start with face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-06.jpg)

##### Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing

![Draw the eyes by drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-07.jpg)

##### Step 3Draw eyebrows

![draw eyebrows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-08.jpg)

##### Step 4Draw jaw

After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.

![draw jaw](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-09.jpg)

##### Step 5Draw nose

##### Step 7Draw ears

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

![Draw ears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg)

As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.

Nevertheless, please don't take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.

So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that's not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.

### 02 Cartoon Paintings of an Old Character

**If you want your character to look old, this is the way to go:**

##### Step 1Old character draw a face

The face is no different from that of a young character. Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don't forget to add wrinkles.

Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.

So far, our focus has been on a male character. So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.

The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women's facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.

### 02 Animated Cartoons

It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.

As much as that's how they seem from the viewer's perspective, that's far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.

![Animated Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-02.jpg)

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

![how to draw cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-1.jpg)

A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child's life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.

However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them?

## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

## Part 1 What is Canva?

Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.

It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.

## Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva

There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.

The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.

Think of the text font you’re going to use.

![Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png)

Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.

![Animated elements Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png)

You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.

![Adding pictures to Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png)

Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.

### 2.1 Image

To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.

For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don't. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.

The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.

![Canva page animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png)

The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.

### 2.2 Text

Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.

![Canva text animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-5.png)

### 2.3 Video

If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.

Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.

With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.

On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.

![Canva playback animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-6.png)

If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.

You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”

## Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva

### How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?

The brilliant thing about Canva is that you can decide the order you want to create your animation. The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.

You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.

### How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva

Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.

If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.

## Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video

If you’ve decided Canva is not the tool for you, you can choose any video editing software to make your animation.

Wondershare Filmora is the tool that can help you level up your content creation. It allows users to increase precision and provides professional video editing options.

**AI Portrait – The best feature of Wondershare Filmora for gameplay editing**

The AI Portrait is a new add-on in Wondershare Filmora. It can easily remove video backgrounds without using a green screen or chroma key, allowing you to add borders, glitch effects, pixelated, noise, or segmentation video effects.

![ai portrait wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-multiple-ai-portrait-add-on.jpg)

### Conclusion

Now that you understand how to build an animation and the software required, you should differentiate between average and extraordinary editing tools.

Filmora and Canva are the best editing tools in this case. Like you can animate individual elements Canva, you can do the same in the other tool also.
