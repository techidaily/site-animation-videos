Emojis formerly reigned supreme, but GIFs and memes have since supplanted them. When you add a GIF to a conversation, it becomes more exciting. GIFs are considerably better at communicating our feelings, and they deserve credit for that. Pinterest, like other social networking sites and chat apps, enables GIFs.

What's the best way to get it? That is what we will demonstrate here. This article will show how to **download Pinterest GIFs** to your computer and mobile device.
