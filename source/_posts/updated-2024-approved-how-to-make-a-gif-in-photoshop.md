 We all love GIFs and their impressive style of delivering stories. They not only contain set of frames rather they wrap inside lots of emotions and thoughts of creators. You can easily find numbers of eye catching GIF collections over social media sites.

 If you love these animated images then probably you might have initiated a search over internet about how to create GIFs. And search engine must have shown you a path to unlimited [GIF creator tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). That's common. But here we are going to talk about one professional recommendation for GIF creation. Yeah, it is Photoshop and it can instantly generate appealing animated Gifs for you.

 Below you will be able to learn strategies to create GIF images with latest version of Photoshop:

## How to make a GIF in Photoshop

* [Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop](#part1)
* [Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop](#part2)

### Method 1: Make a GIF from Video in Photoshop

#### Step 1: Launch your software

 Once you have downloaded your Photoshop software tool on your device then simply run it. Note that CS6 versions of Photoshop provide full support to animated files.

#### Step 2: Get your video clip imported

 As your software timeline is available on screen, now you have to import your desired video file to this platform. Simple go to File option from top left corner of toolbar and then from drop down menu select import. Further select, video frames to layers. Choose your video file and soon all its frames will appear on screen. Photoshop also allows users to work on clipped versions of video files; in that case you can use slider to limit the frames at the time of uploading process.

#### Step 3: Adjust file Import Settings

 You will be glad to know that Photoshop offers creative editing features where you can also make color balance adjustments. When you are done with the frame adjustments then go to File and now choose Save for Web from drop down menu.

 It will immediately open one new window containing all advanced settings that can assist in better customization of your GIF image. As users need small file size for web uploading needs so you can adjust all these parameters below to get best results:

**Colors:** Colors are most important descriptive elements for any video so their selection must be done wisely. As more colors can ensure better view but for reducing file size at the same time you can prefer to drop this selection up to 128.

**Dither:** The dithering process is used to scatter so many colour rich pixels into image so that even a limited colour package can develop intermediate colours over it. If you pick higher number of colours then definitely the image will look finer but at the cost of higher file size.

**Lossy:** If you want to add some internal drop in the quality of image then this setting is useful. But try to keep it lower because higher range may destroy actual information from image whereas smaller value is good if you want to just reduce the file size.

**Size:** Users can prefer to change overall dimensions of their GIF that ultimately leads to huge impact on file size.

#### Step 4: Time to Save your GIF file

 When you are done with the editing process and want to save the newly created GIF image then simply move to the File menu available on top left corner of software window and from drop down menu choose "Save for Web" option. It will further ask you to adjust the output file parameters ahead, make changes as per need of your project and finally get it saved to your device.

### Method 2: Make a GIF from Still Photos in Photoshop

 It is also possible to develop animated GIF images from collection of still images in Photoshop. In this method, users simply need to maintain layers of each frame and then they are sequenced using timeline tool or Photoshop's animation based editing. Here are few simple to follow steps to get best results:

#### 1\.  Step 1

 First of all, user is advised to bring all desired still images into a single folder in his computer. Then go to the software window, move to Files option and further choose Scripts. It will provide you an option for Load Files into Stack. Now hit browse button and choose your images from desktop folder that you further want to use for development of GIF image. Hit OK. It will immediately open a new composition on screen and all these stills will appear like individual layers of a new single image.

 Users can reorder or rearrange these frames as per their desired GIF animation but note that the frame that you want to place at first position in your final GIF must appear at bottom layer and others must follow the same sequence upwards.

 All these GIF layers can also be created individually by user using Photoshop tools. To do this, simply run your Photoshop and then use File > New option to start working with a new project. Hit Ok. It is time to unlock the background layer; you can do this by simply double clicking on the lock icon available on screen. Now in order to create a new layer over it, move to Layer option and press New button. You can design all your new layers with this process. As soon as all your images get created then arrange them in bottom to top order same as the previous method.

 Note that, this process becomes effective only if you are working on the older version of software and it does not have "Load Files into Stack" feature. You can simply load all your desired stills on Photoshop platform and then drag them to new project window. The free transform tool of Photoshop can help you to resize all the added layers as per need. Use shortcut keys: Ctrl+T to make changes faster.

#### 2\.  Step 2

 Now as your entire GIF image layers have been arranged so next task is to start sequencing. If you are working on CS5 or lower version of Photoshop then you van move to animation window by using Window plus Animation option. On the other side, CS6 or CC users need to click over Window + Timeline option.

 As soon as sequencing tool appears on your screen, you will find a small right facing arrow on upper right corner of your screen. Hit this arrow and then choose "Make Frames from Layer" option. The eye icon can be used to hide all unwanted layers. From bottom menu, you can choose looping sequence for your image.

#### 3\.  Step 3

 Finally your animated GIF image is ready and now you can export it to your computer. Hit File option and then Chose Save for Web from drop down menu. But note that for web uploading a file size less then 1MB is acceptable. You can alter it by changing, loss, dither, color and size settings. At last hit Save button and now you can upload your GIF.

Now, when it comes to video marketing, the majority of businesses prefer choosing 2D animations. The reason being 2D animations have a lower production cost and they still offer complete liberty over creativity. However, it's worth noting that editing a visually engaging 2D animation requires expertise.

That's why it's always an ideal solution to hire a dedicated **2D animation company**. Such organizations have experienced video editors who specialize in 2D video editing and can craft the perfect 2D animation for your brand. In this article, we are going to walk you through a list of the top 12 **2D animation studios** you can hire to launch an enticing marketing video for your business.

#### In this article

01 [What is a 2D Animation Video and How Much Does a 2D Animation Video Cost?](#Part 1)

02 [How Much Time Does It Take to Create a 2D Animation Video?](#Part 2)

03 [What Are the Best Company for Creating 2D Animation Video?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is a 2D Animation Video and How Much Does a 2D Animation Video Cost?

First things first; what is a 2D animation and why is it necessary to hire a **2D animation company**? In layman's terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can't be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).

Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it's always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach.

## Part 1 What is a 2D Animation Video and How Much Does a 2D Animation Video Cost?

First things first; what is a 2D animation and why is it necessary to hire a **2D animation company**? In layman's terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can't be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).

Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it's always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.

The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000\. It all depends on the length of the video, the production company you hire, and the quality you are looking for. But, it's also worth noting that high pricing does not always mean superior quality as well. You'll have to be extra cautious while picking through the **best 2D animation studios**.

## Part 2 How Much Time Does It Take to Create a 2D Animation Video?

Due to their immense popularity in the marketing world, many business owners and marketers want to know how much time it takes to create a 2D animation video. Well, the answer is - it depends. If you have hired a team of professional editors or a dedicated **2D animation company**, you'll get your animated video within a week. However, if you try to follow the DIY approach and don't know where to get started, it can even take up to 3-4 weeks for the video to complete.

Now that you know the cost and time it takes to create a 2D animation video, let's dive into the list of the most popular **2D animation studios** you can hire for the next project.

"Where is everyone getting their **3D Text Animation** templates?"

To answer this request, we've compiled a guide that not only teaches you how to create things like **3D Spinning Text (After Effects)** but also gives you an idea of where you can find the kind of resources (i.e., **3D Text Animation** templates and presets) that you need to get a head start on your projects.

02 [How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?](#Part 2)

03 [The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates](#Part 3)

04 [Secrets to Learning More Animation Tactics](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

![Add Graphic Elements to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates5.png)

## Part 3 **The Best 10 Amazing 3D Text Animation Templates**

Now, as promised, we're also going to be introducing a couple of **3D text animation** templates that you can try out for your own projects! Each template will have a link that you can go to in order to see what it looks like, as well as an explanation on how you can use it for your projects in the future!

### 01Real 3D Light Bulb Kit

The first Text Animation Template on our list is the "Logo Light Bulb" 3D Animation from Envato Elements. This one literally glows people! Making it perfect for a quirky, and yet still very impressive Title Card or Logo. Its design is very realistic, and you can also control how it flickers! For example, turning the bulbs on certain characters first, or turning them all off at once in the end.

### 023D Text Reveal

This next 3D Animation template is also from Envato Market. And, just like the first, it makes for quite the dramatic Title Card or Logo. With this template, your Text can literally zoom in to view while looking its best and sparkiest in High-Chrome.

### 033D Metallic Text Animation

Our next pick, the 3D Metallic text animation is another great one for those who are looking for something flashy — something that gives off the impression of being impressive right from the gate. Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

### 053D Text & Logo Boxes

This next one, the 3D Text & Logo Boxes pack is particularly perfect for 3D logos. The pack gives you several options for box size as well as text parameters. So, you can design your animated 3D Logo however you want and use it for future projects to give them even more dimension than before.

### 06The Light Bulb Kit

Our next pick, which is the 'Light Bulb Kit' also from Envato, is very similar to the first item on our list — in that it features text lit up by lightbulbs. However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want. Literally, the template will ask you to choose your own text and change the colors to suit that of your own brand, then you're done!

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!

**●** You see a lot of 3D Text Animation in big pictures these days. And you can start creating your own with the use of Adobe After Effects — a VFX and Motion Graphics Software that a lot of professionals use for their own text animation.

**●** Of course, if you don't have the kind of time to create your own 3D Text Animations from scratch, you can always use templates instead! There are hundreds (if not thousands) of them available out there. It should be simple enough to find one that fits the kind of vibe you're looking for.

**●** SECRET TIP! If you're looking for an all-in-one kind of solution, you might want to consider Filmora Pro. It's a video editor, first and foremost, but that's not all it is — you can be using it today to start creating your own 3D Text Animations!

However, it lends an extra bit of photo-realism to it. Less sparkle and more grain — which may exactly be what you want for your new title card or logo.

### 073D Text Templates

The 3D Text Templates is a very bright and pop-y template that is perfect for creating eye-catching promotions and advertisements. It's very simple to use, which, again, maybe exactly what you want.

### 083D Text Shapes Logo Reveal

The '3D Text Shapes Logo Reveal' template is a pack of 3D text animations that you can use in order to add a little spin to your logo reveals (quite literally, in some cases!) It has a lot of personality to it, and a certain tech-y or science-y feel that would make it perfect for anyone looking for something more technical.

### 09Bold Titles

The 'Bold Titles' template is very loud and proud. But it has a bit of a retro-vibe to it as well. Making it stand out from some of the more minimalistic modern text animation styles that you see these days.

### 1010\. Wave 3D Logo & Text

Looking for something simple and professional? Then the 'Wave 3D Logo & Text' template may just be the one for you. We put it last on this list, but it's actually quite a strong contender. One that just about anyone (for just about any type of project they're working on), should be able to get some use out of.

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** 3D Text Animation is the practice of bringing text to life! It gives dimension, depth, and, even, movement into what are usually very static properties!

## Part 1 What's 3D Text Animation?

Before anything else, let's talk about text animation. Specifically, 3D Text Animation. The text that you're reading now, is 2D Text. It's static, and it lacks depth. It's just letters on a screen. Meanwhile, 3D Text is usually built for motion, and thus, it has volume and depth — it's almost tangible. Here's what that looks like:

![3D Text Example Yay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates1.png)

As you can see, even without actually moving, in the text shown in the image above, the potential for motion is there — it looks alive.

Now, you'll see 3D text like this often in movies or promotions. Usually in the form of extravagant title cards or **3D text logo animation**. They're eye-catching, and because they're 3D, you can play with them as much as you want to really add drama to your creations.

## Part 2 **How Do I Make 3D Text in After Effects?**

As promised, this next section will teach you how to create **3D Text Animation** in Adobe After Effects, which is a VFX and motion graphics software used by many animators to bring life to their text. You'll notice that the following tutorial is really more about introducing the tools that you can use in order to create **3D Text Animation**:

### 01Step 1\. Add Your Text

The first thing that you have to do, of course, is to add your text! To do this, go to the 'Tools' panel, select the Type tool, and then select the 'Composition' panel. The composition is where you type your text!

With After Effects, you also have the following options:

**●** Change Text Font

**●** Adjust Text Size

**●** Adjust Text Color

**●** Shift Justification (Left, Middle, right)

And so on! Once you're done with your text composition, it will be generated by After Effects into a layer that you can adjust as needed in the next steps.

![Add Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates2.png)

### 01Step 2\. Use Animation Presets

With your text now in a layer that you can add animations to… you've practically done a third of the job! Or even more than that if you decide to use the animation presets that are provided by After Effects.

These can be found by selecting 'Browse Presets…' on the 'Animation' tab (shown in the image below.) All you need to apply them is to drag and drop them onto your text layer.

Note: The first keyframe of this built-in text animation will be applied at the location of the Current Time Indicator (CTI), so make sure that you've adjusted that accordingly.

![Use Text Animation Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates3.png)

### 01Step 3\. Per-Character Animation

If you'd like to personalize your text animation, After Effects does also give you the option to animate per character (or, per letter, in this case.)

This will give you more control over how you decided to animate your text. Of course, it does mean that it is slightly more complicated as well.

**●** To animate text per layer, select 'animate' on that layer and choose a parameter to start working on animations for.

**●** You'll be able to previous (or scrub) through your animations in order to see if they are doing what you need them to do.

**●** You can also remove applied parameters in order to re-work your animation.

![Animate Text Per Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates4.png)

### 01Step 4\. Add Graphic Elements to Text

If you really want to make your **3D Animation Text** pop, Adobe After Effects also offers the tools needed to add Graphic Elements to your composition — which can be found at the top-most toolbar!

![Add Graphic Elements to Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/top-10-3d-text-animation-templates5.png)

Compared to the previous text animation template, this one has a more rugged kind of appearance. Perfect for those looking to promote something more fun rather than professional.

### 043D Text Box Animation Pack

The next one is a little less 'impressive' — in the sense that it isn't as in your face as the other 3D animation templates that we've introduced thus far. And that's exactly why the 3D Text Box Animation Pack deserves to be on this list! Its **3D spinning text (after effects)** elements are very usable — in that it can work for a variety of individuals and styles. It has a more professional look as well. Making it perfect for corporations.

When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to **convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop**, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. Its file format is a compressed image, and it is most suitable for animation. We all know that an animated GIF comprises a series of many still images. However, since these images play sequentially, it may appear as if they are in motion. It is that movement illusion that makes the animation effect come about.

## Part 1 How to Convert Video to GIF in Photoshop - Easy Way

If you want to **convert video to GIF** in Photoshop, here is a discussion of the easy way to go about it.

**Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right**

When you start to convert **mp4 to GIF using Photoshop**, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.

The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.

Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.

**Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop**

Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.

![import video photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly**

After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.

![preview of the video photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The "From Beginning to End" is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select "Selected Range Only." On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.

Last but not least, check the "Make Frame Animation" checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.

**Step 4: Edit the GIF**

Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.

![edit gif photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.

**Step 5: Save the GIF**

Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).

![save gif photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-4.jpg)

That’s how to convert Mp4 to GIF in simple steps.

## Part 2 How to Create Animated GIFs from Video without Photoshop

Today, we'll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we've even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to **make a caricature of a photo**.

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

![Caricature Hyper Face Morph Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

![Cartoon Caricature Face Camera Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects9.png)

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Caricature is now possible in an instant with the use of a **caricature maker** app. These tools render an existing photograph with the use of filters and effects to create a **caricature sketch** worthy of any artist's skill.

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.

02 [How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330>

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743>

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.
