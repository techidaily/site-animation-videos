### 01**Detailed Construction Requirements**

As mentioned previously, a lot of architects and construction engineers would prefer to work with designers who can show them their vision through **3D Architectural Animation**. This gives them an idea of exactly what you want in terms of construction requirements.

![Man Drawing Traditional Architectural Designs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation3.png)

### 02**Complete Visual Touring**

Of course, outside of construction parameters, there's also the major benefit of just being able to see the finished project in its fully rendered form. In the case of designers and construction engineers, it erases any risk of misunderstandings. And, when it comes to clients, they can more easily visualize your plans and the work that is required to make it a reality.

![Traditional Architectural Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation4.png)

### 03**Scope and Scale of Project**

Continuing from the same vein we left off in the previous listing. A **3D Architectural Animation** shows off the specific scope and scale of the project. Not just in terms of sizing (although that's important too), but also the kind of budget that would be required in order to get it done, and what changes could be made in regards to the current real estate property (if there's any.)

![Understanding the Scope and Scale of the Architectural Project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation5.png)

### 04**Architectural Animations Easily Shareable**

We mentioned this in passing previously, but **architectural animations** are great because they are so much easier to share. Now, no longer will you have to come to a project discussion with piles and piles of blueprints that your client is unlikely to truly understand in full

Instead, you can invest in creating stunning walk-throughs or flythroughs of the ‘finished' property with the use of video editors like Filmora and ensure that they are able to share in your vision from the onset.

![Share Architectural Animations Easily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation6.png)

### 05**Customer Reassurance Boost**

Of course, one great thing about having to show something to your client is that you can give them peace and mind by proving to them that you know what you are doing, that you have a plan, and that this plan is right here. It's quite relieving, as we're certain you can understand, to have something solid to ground you when faced with such big, life-changing projects.

![Shake on It Close Deals with Reassurance Boost](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation7.png)

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

![Making Changes to Architectural Plans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/learn-how-to-make-architecture-animation8.png)

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

## Part 3 **5 Famous 3D Animation Services and Studio**

If your goal is to eventually make a name for yourself in the world of **3D Animation Architecture,** then it's a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with some of the more popular 3D Animation Services and Studios (who provide the kind of service required to create **architectural animations** like that you see in **Studio Ghibli Architecture**)

### 01**VisEngine**

The first on this list of 3D Architecture Studio is "VisEngine." They offer pop-up 3D Animation, Pop-Up Design, Origami Architecture, Kirigami Animation, and more Their main tools, as you would say, are Corona Renderer, Autodesk 3DS Max, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Premiere Pro If you're curious as to the look of their finished **architectural animations**, they have some great samples available on YouTube that you can check out

### 02**Exodo Animation Studios**

"Exodo Animation Studios" is another animation service provider that provides high-quality 3D Animation work for architecture — although their service, much like other 3D Animation Studios, is not limited to that They've had their hand in creating plenty of 3D characters and are a well-known name-brand in the realm of CGI

### 03**Promoshin**

Promoshin is perhaps better known for its 3D Character Animation, but that doesn't mean their architectural work is anything to scoff at They cater, specifically, to brands who want to create 3D Animation promotional content. And, to this end, they've worked with quite a lot of name-brands (including NASA, Uber, Cisco, and so on)

### 04**ZOA Studio**

ZOA Studio brings us back to **Architecture Animation** services providers that are well-known in the architectural industry They provide both exterior and interior work for many architects around the world — with a portfolio of great examples of old work available for you to look through on YouTube (it's a great resource for those looking for inspiration)

### 05**Studio Aiko**

Again, this next studio, called "Studio Aiko" is usually better known for its regular 3D Animation work. However, that doesn't mean that their **architectural animations** are any lesser in quality They produce very high-quality work fit for any kind of media platform. Making it a fitting solution for many professional architects

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

## Part 1 **What is Architectural 3D Animation?**

### 01**How is animation used in architecture?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is the same as a live walkthrough of a home or building, except it's all done digitally In the literal sense, you can experience a real estate project in full (both interior and exterior design, although some animation studios do offer those services separately.) These animations are usually done with the help of CAD architecture-friendly software. Like Maya, Autodesk, Giza, and so on.

Then they're either shared as is — fully explorable in all sorts of angles. Or, as finished videos run through on a professional video editor, like Filmora, which can be used to create stunning ‘walk-throughs' that you can share with clients and partners alike

### 02**Why is 3D Animation Important for the Architecture Industry?**

**3D Animation Architecture** is quite difficult to make, usually involving hours of work rendering everything in proper form. However, these days, **Architecture Animation** software is not only more accessible but much easier to use as well Because of this, the demand for **Architectural Animations** grew, with architects and construction engineers preferring only to work with those who could provide them with the kind of detailed project that is usually afforded by **3D Architectural Animation**.

### 06**Make Corrections Early and Efficiently**

Another benefit of having a fully rendered end-product in front of you is that you can very easily make changes as needed. If the client thinks that this part is a little too small or if they think that this door is unfashionable. You can make the change easily with the right CAD software and then ask their opinion again to ensure that you've got the look right this time around

No more illegible notes on paper blueprints. You can get right to editing on the 3D model itself, and see your corrections come to life not long after.

### 07**Architectural Animations Are Promotable Content**

So long as you are given permission by your clients, you can use finished projects as promotable content — either by publishing it on YouTube or your website, where it can be discovered by future clients that may be interested in your work In this way, you can show them your previous work without having to go through the trouble of recording an extra live walk-through of the property after the fact It's already there after all, why not use it?

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.
