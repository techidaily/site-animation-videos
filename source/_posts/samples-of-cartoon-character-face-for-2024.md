## Part 1 **Cartoon Easy Drawing with Colour Step by Step**

Applying color to a drawing is very important to beautify your drawing and make it look stunning and attractive. Here is how to **cartoon easy drawing** a flower using a colored pencil:

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

![how to draw cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-1.jpg)

A cartoon character is a series of single drawings that tell a joke or story. Although cartoons are mostly drawn, they can sometimes be animated. Kids like comics which makes them an essential part of every child's life. Cartoons are not only used for entertainment purposes but also help kids and young children learn more about the world around them. For example, children learn about love, loss, friendship, and other essential life issues about life by watching cartoons.

However, cartoons are not only limited to children but are also for adults. In addition, cartoons created for an adult audience go deeper into real-life problems and explore darker themes. They aim to create content that matches the maturity and age of the audience. Watching cartoons is fun. But what if you could make them? This article will provide you with a guide on producing **cool cartoon drawings** that will match different audiences, both older and younger.

**Step 1:** Using a color photocopy of a reference photo, crop and rearrange elements of the poppy composition. With light pressure and HB pencil, draw a composition onto a four-ply, 100% cotton museum board frequently found among framing supplies.

![how to draw with colour 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-2.jpg)

**Step 2:** With very light pressure, apply the first colored pencil layer and add more emphasis where the values will be deeper. While doing this, note that the pencil application will still appear granular, and the texture of the museum board is still visible.

![how to draw with colour 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-3.png)

**Step 3:** Create the veins in the leaves and the fuzzy texture of the stem and pod, and also, as the individual strands of stamens, put down a sheet of translucent drafting paper. Use heavy tracing paper with a very sharp 7H graphite pencil and apply heavy pressure in drawing the lines for stamens, fuzz, and veins on the drafting paper and impress them into the surface of the museum board. Then, with a contrasting layer of darker color, these features dramatically show up on the stem, leaves, center of the flower, pod, and center of the flower. Then add deeper values of rose in the shadowed areas of the flower petals.

![how to draw with colour 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-4.jpg)

**Step 4:** To make them appear less granular and intensify the colors, start by blending with a clear, alcohol-based blending marker. The solvent, wax, or vegetable oil then dissolves the binder in the colored pencil layer and fluidly releases the pigment. This will also help to "fill in" the dots of the tooth of the paper and make the color appear denser.

![how to draw with colour 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-5.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to intensify the color by using a non-pigmented blending pencil over a previous layer and repeat a layer or two of color, much like a "color sandwich." Repeat this " burnishing " process for subsequent layerings of color, like a double-decker or triple-decker sandwich.

Also, make sure the rich, dark negative space is carried out the same way, layering colors and burnishing, then repeating the colors for deep, rich saturation.

Render the deep, smeary flecks of pollen by heavily applying "freckles" of burgundy, then slightly smudge them with the tip of a blending marker. Lastly, scratch a few of the tiny wisps of fuzz on the pod and stem carefully into the board via a sharp X-acto knife for a striking contrast of light against the deep background.

## Part 2 **Cartoon Easy Sketch Drawing Step by Step**

This is the initial stage of the drawing process. It requires you to create an outline of the concept you want to draw before adding color. However, it is also referred to as a technique in shading. For example, if you're going to sketch a cherry fruit, there are a few things to note here.

Try not to look at the cherry as a whole but look at its shapes and name them. This way, you are looking at the parts to the whole and not the entire piece.

![how to sketch drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-draw-cartoons%20-7.jpg)

**Step 1:** Draw two overlapping circles and draw two curved lines from each of the circles.

**Step 2:** Make a small rectangle at the top to join the two stems and draw a second set of curved lines.

**Step 3:** Draw thick lines inside the rectangle for the bumps and darken the lines and use your finger to smudge them a bit for the shaded effect.

**Step 4:** Draw a curved line from the stem on the right to the circle's edge to create the bump.

**Step 5:** Holding your pencil at an angle, make light strokes going across the front of both cherries. Take note of the places where there is no light. This is where the light source is hitting the cherry the most.

**Step 6:** To darken, a shade over those places again, keep layering the shading technique until you get the effect you see on the cherries.

**Step 7:** Use the same technique to shade under the cherries, but use your finger to smudge it to smoother the shadow.

**2D character animation** is one of the significant kinds of animation popularly used for creating animated movies, marketing videos, cartoons, advertisements, educational content, corporate presentations, video games, etc.

With the popularity of video content, more and more businesses tend to use animation for promotion, as they magnify conversion rates by 20%. Some companies hire **2D character animation services**; others try to make them online with software help.

02 [2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks](#Part 2)

03 [An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online](#Part 3)

04 [5 Great 2D Character Animation Templates](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?

**2D animation** is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.

However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.

We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.

With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various **2D character animation** software.

In this guide, we'll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let's proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within **animation character 2D**.

## Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks

### 01Look for a real-time reference

Using a real-world reference for **2D character animation** can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.

If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.

### 02Observe real life

You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of **2D character animation** is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.

Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don't spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.

### 03Simplicity is the key

**2D character animation** is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene's realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.

### 04Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can't complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For **2D character animation**, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.

You can't master the skill of **animation character 2D** quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.

### 05Feedback is important

Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It's wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.

## Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online

Let's now look at making an illustrated **2D character animation** move on a screen.

While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.

**Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects**

### 01Step 1: Download and Install Duik

You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters' entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.

While this isn't an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you'll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from [Rainbox Laboratory.](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/)

### 02Step 2: Design Your Character

You need a moving character before you're able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.

Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character's limbs.

In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.

![draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg)

Check the character's joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.

![character animation joints](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg)

### 03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork

Now, you'll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.

So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg's segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).

![import character artwork](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg)

To import your character artwork, go to **File**, click the **Import** tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.

### 04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging

Now, the **2D character animation** is almost over by the initial rigging.

Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.

Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It's simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character's layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the **2D** **character animation**.

The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs' section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg's upper portion, where it meets the body).

![character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg)

Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs' sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.

It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.

Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the **2D character animation**, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.

### 05Step 5: Create Your Rig

Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.

You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.

The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.

Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.

![create character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character

You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character's movement. The character's legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.

Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.

Moreover, you can add 'easing” to the animation via **2D character animation After** **Effects'** **Easy Ease** tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.

It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.

![add keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg)

Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.

As you practice, you'll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic **2D animation character design** capabilities.

## Part 1 What is 2D Character Animation and What Does 2D Animation Do?

**2D animation** is identified by having its characters and objects created in a 2D space. It means that they only have height and width to specify.

However, 2D animation is considered a traditional style, known from the 1800s. Initially, it was designed by merging the frames in which one drawing was followed by another and making them different; every second consists of 24 frames.

We all remember the classic Disney animations. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, The Little Mermaid, Bambi, etc. They are some of the highly famous 2D animation styles.

With the advancement of computer technologies, this process also got digitized through various **2D character animation** software.

In this guide, we'll talk about everything relatable to 2D character animation, and let's proceed with the expert tips and tricks to create inspirational style within **animation character 2D**.

## Part 2 2D Character Animation Tips and Tricks

### 01Look for a real-time reference

Using a real-world reference for **2D character animation** can help you effectively animate faces. For example, when studios collaborate with voice-over artists, they often record their facial movements. It further helps 2D animators to ensure their expressions get captured convincingly.

If it seems impossible, you can consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could also use a mirror and utter the words your character will speak. It will display the correct animated expressions.

### 02Observe real life

You need to use observation a lot more. One of the primary aspects of **2D character animation** is bringing life to animate objections. Therefore, you must carefully consider how emotion can get portrayed and select each movement accordingly.

Take time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each other, how they express emotions, how they move, etc. Please don't spend much time doing this, as it is valuable to research.

### 03Simplicity is the key

**2D character animation** is never complex compared with 3D. Think carefully before creating a scene too complicated. You must not include too much information, which is hard to digest, and you may even find yourself compromising the scene's realism. Try not to heavy the stage with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it genuine.

### 04Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation consumes a lot of time. You can't complete it within one day, so you better know deep down that one task only can be done after you have revamped it various times. For **2D character animation**, you may need to draw objects on paper several times.

You can't master the skill of **animation character 2D** quickly. Luckily, all pains will be relieved someday.

### 05Feedback is important

Feedback is an essential element of artistic development. It's wise to actively seek out feedback from familiar figures who can help you enhance. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will assist you produce the results hit the spot much more appropriately.

## Part 3 An Ultimate Guide to Create 2D Character Animation Online

Let's now look at making an illustrated **2D character animation** move on a screen.

While there are nearly numerous options for 2D character animation tools and software, this tutorial will animate a character in Adobe After Effects.

**Steps to create 2D character animation After Effects**

### 01Step 1: Download and Install Duik

You need to install the Duik animation plugin for Adobe After Effects to simplify the whole process. You can animate and rig characters' entire limbs with Duik using just the placement of their feet and hands.

While this isn't an essential step, it can be valuable for beginners, as you'll see in this tutorial. Luckily, Duik is available for free from [Rainbox Laboratory.](https://rainboxlab.org/tools/duik/)

### 02Step 2: Design Your Character

You need a moving character before you're able to start animating. You can create this character in Adobe Illustrator and import it into After Effects.

Try creating a straightforward character with an aim on the character's limbs.

In the example mentioned below, you can see that the body is a very rudimentary shape—a circle—with long legs that make it simple to consider the animation process.

![draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg)

Check the character's joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.

![character animation joints](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg)

### 03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork

Now, you'll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.

So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg's segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).

![import character artwork](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg)

To import your character artwork, go to **File**, click the **Import** tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.

### 04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging

Now, the **2D character animation** is almost over by the initial rigging.

Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.

Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It's simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character's layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the **2D** **character animation**.

The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs' section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg's upper portion, where it meets the body).

![character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg)

Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs' sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.

It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.

Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the **2D character animation**, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.

### 05Step 5: Create Your Rig

Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.

You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.

The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.

Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.

![create character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character

You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character's movement. The character's legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.

Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.

Moreover, you can add 'easing” to the animation via **2D character animation After** **Effects'** **Easy Ease** tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.

It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.

![add keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg)

Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.

As you practice, you'll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic **2D animation character design** capabilities.

![draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-01.jpg)

Check the character's joints. Making a round joint between the lower and upper parts of the legs, for instance, will help the character move more smoothly.

![character animation joints](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-02.jpg)

### 03Step 3: Make and Import Your Character Artwork

Now, you'll need to make a few final adjustments before moving your character artwork. Break your character out into layers firstly. Every section of the character that will move independently needs a separate layer.

So, layers include his circular body, face, and the leg's segments (i.e., lower leg, upper leg, and foot).

![import character artwork](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-03.jpg)

To import your character artwork, go to **File**, click the **Import** tab, and choose your character file. Ensure that you need to import it as a composition to ensure it includes the layers you just created.

### 04Step 4: Establish Initial Character Rigging

Now, the **2D character animation** is almost over by the initial rigging.

Firstly, lower the opacity of all your layers to above 50% to see the critical joints within the character.

Next, you must ensure that the joints hinge in the ideal direction. It's simple to do with the anchor point tool. For each character's layer, place the anchor point at the center of gravity for each layer of the **2D** **character animation**.

The anchor point would probably go between the eyes for the layer of the face (i.e., the nose, eyes, and mouth). For each legs' section, hold the anchor point where the leg will hinge (e.g., the anchor point would be at the highest point for the leg's upper portion, where it meets the body).

![character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-04.jpg)

Then, use the parent tool to join the limbs' sections. For instance, the parent of the foot would be the lower leg, and the upper portion is the parent of the lower leg.

It makes sure that the leg moves together as one unit with multiple hinge points.

Finally, use the Duik toolbar to create character controllers. Controllers control the rotation and position of critical elements within your character. For the ankles of the **2D character animation**, you would select the controller that encompasses both the rotation and position.

### 05Step 5: Create Your Rig

Use the Duik toolbar to create a rig. Select each layer from the extremities inward from each limb, lasting with your controllers.

You would select the ankle for a leg, followed by the upper portion, the lower leg, and conclusively, the controller at the ankle. Then, select auto-rig within the Rigging area of the Duik toolbar.

The entire leg will move when you move that ankle controller. If your character contains them, repeat the process for the other leg, along with other limbs.

Before proceeding, test the limbs to make sure they hinge and move correctly. You need to adjust the opacity of the character back to 100% once you are satisfied with the movements.

![create character rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-05.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Start Animating Your Character

You can begin animating after completing a rig. First, create keyframes—the ending and beginning points of the character's movement. The character's legs are at their most magnified are thus the endpoints for a walk cycle. Make sure that the beginning and ending of keyframes are identical to get an ideal loop.

Start adding in-between frames from there, like when one leg crosses over the other in the middle of a walking stride.

Moreover, you can add 'easing” to the animation via **2D character animation After** **Effects'** **Easy Ease** tab, located under the Animation button, and Keyframe Assistant.

It will smoothen the transition between the keyframes. You will have a primary walking sequence at this instance.

![add keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/2d-character-animation-everything-you-should-know-about-it-06.jpg)

Now, you can make further refinements to add detail and secondary movement, like a bobbing motion of the head. You can also modify elements like the keyframe velocity, further smoothing out the animation.

As you practice, you'll get a better feel for your animation preferences and develop more advanced realistic **2D animation character design** capabilities.
