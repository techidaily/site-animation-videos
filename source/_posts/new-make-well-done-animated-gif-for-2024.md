### 01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character

**These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:**

##### Step 1Start with the face

The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.

After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.

![start with face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-06.jpg)

##### Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing

Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.

Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.

![Draw the eyes by drawing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-07.jpg)

##### Step 3Draw eyebrows

On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.

![draw eyebrows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-08.jpg)

##### Step 4Draw jaw

After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.

![draw jaw](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-09.jpg)

##### Step 5Draw nose

Design the nose and ensure that you don't put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.

![Draw nose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-10.jpg)

##### Step 6Draw mouth

Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.

![Draw mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-11.jpg)

##### Step 7Draw ears

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

![Draw ears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg)

##### Step 8Draw haircut

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.

Nevertheless, please don't take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.

So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that's not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.

![draw haircut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-13.jpg)

### 02 Cartoon Paintings of an Old Character

**If you want your character to look old, this is the way to go:**

##### Step 1Old character draw a face

The face is no different from that of a young character. Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don't forget to add wrinkles.

Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.

![Old character draw face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-14.jpg)

##### Step 3Old character draw the nose

Ensure that the nose design looks wider and larger since the character is old. To achieve that, make the nose look close to the eyes

![Old character draw nose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-16.jpg)

##### Step 4Old character exaggerates mustache

### 03 Cartoon Painting of a Female Character

So far, our focus has been on a male character. So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.

The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women's facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.

![Draw ears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-12.jpg)

##### Step 8Draw haircut

Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won't make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.

As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.

Nevertheless, please don't take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.

So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that's not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.

##### Step 1Old character draw a face

03 [Is There Anything else You Can Do to Draw Cartoons More Quickly?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?

As far as good cartoons are concerned, expect about 5 popular types. These **cartoons to draw** include:

### 01 Illustrative Cartoons

They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.

The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.

It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.

![illustrative cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-01.jpg)

### 02 Animated Cartoons

It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.

As much as that's how they seem from the viewer's perspective, that's far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.

![Animated Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-02.jpg)

### 03 Comic Strips or Panels

In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.

Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.

The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.

![Comic Strips or Panels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-03.jpg)

### 04 Gag Cartoons

As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.

Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that's often a single sentence.

![Gag Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-04.jpg)

### 05 Editorial or Political Cartoons

These cartoons are also made for the newspapers. Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper's editorial comment.

As much as some have captions, that's not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.

![Editorial or Political Cartoons](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/in-depth-study-of-cartoon-painting-starts-from-learning-to-draw-it-05.jpg)

Childhood crushes and idolization of **animated characters** were very normal things! **Popular animated characters** were designed to appeal to our taste — bringing life to great tropes that would keep our interests engaged and excited to see more!

Today, in order to reminisce a little, we'll be going through some of the more **famous animated characters**!

Although we initially promised only 15 **animated characters**, we've stepped up our game to include a couple of honorable mentions just to give you even more **popular animated characters** to reminisce about! We've also included some of the movies that these characters appear in (with clips included, even!). So, if you want, you can catch them in action!

### 01Mickey Mouse

**Movie(s)**: Fantasia (1940), Fantasia 2000 (1999)

**First Appearance**: Steamboat Willie (1928)

**Voiced by**: Walt Disney, Jimmy MacDonald, Wayne Allwine

When it comes to admirable **animated characters**, Disney's Mickey Mouse is pretty memorable! Even now, you can still seem on the big screen during the previews, whistling an all too familiar tune! He merited the top spot simply for that fame, even though, in all honesty, his time on the big screen had been pretty limited (with his biggest performance having been from Fantasia).

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 02Woody

**Movie(s)**: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)

**First Appearance**: Toy Story (1995)

**Voiced by**: Tom Hanks

We of course also cannot forget Toy Story's Woody in a discussion of **famous animated characters**. This cowboy toy comes equipped with a pull-string that just oozes personality (both good and bad), leading up to a very satisfying movie-watching experience as we watch him grow from the selfish toy that he had been in the beginning to the generous, and forgiving toy that he developed into by the fourth movie in the series!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 03Buzz Lightyear

**Movie(s)**: Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), Toy Story 4 (2019)

**First Appearance**: Toy Story (1995)

**Voiced by**: Tim Allen

Of course, if one mentions Woody, one must not forget his best friend, the spacey space cadet, Buzz Lightyear! As far as **animated characters** go, Toy Story really had it made with their complex and emotionally-superior character development. Buzz Lightyear's growth from a delusional 'space-ranger-wannabe' into a toy was very heartening to watch, and it was played beautifully by the animators and his voice actor, Tim Allen!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 04Dory

**Movie(s)**: Finding Nemo (2003), Finding Dory (2016)

**First Appearance**: Finding Nemo (2003)

**Voiced by**: Ellen DeGeneres

Dory was undoubtedly the underdog of the Finding Nemo franchise! This lovable fish, **Voiced by** the equally loveable Ellen DeGeneres, stole the show and earned herself her own feature film that all the animated movie lovers came to watch in 2016! Her ditzy character made for very amusing segments in what could have otherwise been a very grim story, one that many of the older watchers still come back to this day.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 05Totoro

**Movie(s)**: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)

**First Appearance**: My Neighbour Totoro (1988)

**Voiced by**: Hitoshi Takagi

Speaking of cute characters, how can one forget about Totoro! Despite having been written in a different language, 'My Neighbor Totoro' has managed to burrow its way into the hearts of many a movie watcher. And of course, this is all things to the loveable animated character, Totoro — who is cuddly, gentle, and peaceful!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 06Genie

**Movie(s)**: Aladdin (1992), The Return of Jafar (1994), Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996)

**First Appearance**: Aladdin (1992)

**Voiced by**: Robin Williams

When talking about **animated characters**, one must also not forget the phenomenal performance of Genie from the Aladdin franchise! **Voiced by** Robin Williams, Genie was brought to life in a way that changed the industry for good, bringing an influx of more lively voice acting in the future!

If you're the type to want to **make your animated character**, taking inspiration from Robin William's Genie would surely not lead you astray! In fact, you can get started on it today, if you wanted! All you have to do is pick up a good mic and a professional video editor like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** Pro that can help you in your quest to bring your characters to life!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 07Wall-E

**Movie(s)**: Wall-E (2008)

**First Appearance**: Cameo in Cars (2006)

**Voiced by**: Ben Burtt

Wall-E broke the box office for its underlying message regarding how we humans treat our world, but also because of its loveable characters! Who can say that they did not fall in love with Wall-E and his darling Eve? Despite his almost-mute character, he was brought to life in a way that made him very easy to love and would be remembered for years to come.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 08Donkey

**Movie(s)**: Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek 3, Shrek Forever After, a Christmas short

**First Appearance**: Shrek

**Voiced by**: Eddie Murphy

Shrek's Donkey is another one of those characters that you just cannot forget! **Voiced by** the hilarious Eddie Murphy, he added that constant spark of humor that kept the movie's tone light and exciting, fully encompassing the kind of tone that the film was going for.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 09Cruella de Vil

**Movie(s)**: 101 Dalmatians

**First Appearance**: 101 Dalmatians

**Voiced by**: Betty Lou Gerson

When it comes to classic villain **animated characters**, one cannot forget about the illustrious Cruella de Vil! This character was pure evil in a feminine form! Designed to be the enemy of puppy lovers everywhere all while bringing a little spice into what would have otherwise been a sweet, slice of life film.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 10Boo

**Movie(s)**: Monsters Inc.

**First Appearance**: Monsters Inc.

**Voiced by**: Mary Gibbs

Boo from Monsters Inc is one of the most **popular animated characters** on the big screen! She was loveable, sweet, and perfectly voice acted — bringing on some much-needed cute into the heart-warming story.

**Related Movie Clips**:

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 11Mike Wasowski

**Movie(s)**: Monsters Inc

**First Appearance**: Monsters Inc

**Voiced by**: Billy Crystal

Still on the Monster Inc train, we have Mike Wasowski! His refreshing character brought some levity into the story, bringing on some much-needed laughs and just, in general, providing a solid counterpart to Sulley!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 12Toothless

**Movie(s)**: How To Train Your Dragon, How to Train your Dragon 2

**First Appearance**: How To Train Your Dragon

**Voiced by**: N/A

A more modern, but no-less loveable **animated character** that we all know and love is Toothless from 'How to Train Your Dragon!' Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 13Chihiro

**Movie(s)**: Spirited Away (2001)

**First Appearance**: Spirited Away (2001)

**Voiced by**: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase

The story of Chihiro from 'Spirited Away' is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget! This character, if you weren't aware, was also created by Miyazaki (the same creator of 'Totoro!') She's a part of a long line of greatly designed and developed characters whose journey you just can't look away from.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 14Lumiere

**Movie(s)**: Beauty and the Beast (1991), The Enchanted Christmas (1997)

**First Appearance**: Beauty and the Beast (1991)

**Voiced by**: Jerry Orbach

'Beauty and the Beast' is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved **Disney Animated Characters**, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (**Voiced by** Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the 'Be Our Guest' track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast's love story.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 15Sophie

**Movie(s)**: Howl's Moving Castle (2004)

**First Appearance**: Howl's Moving Castle (2004)

**Voiced by**: Chieko Baisho; Emily Mortimer & Jean Simmons

To wrap up our main list, we have another Miyazaki character in the form of Sophie — from Howl's Moving Castle! Howl's Moving Castle is another beautiful classic that you just can't help but love, and a lot of that is all thanks to its complex and believable heroine, Sophie!

**Related Movie Clips**:

**Movie(s)**: The Jungle Book (1967), The Jungle Book 2 (2003)

**First Appearance**: The Jungle Book (1967)

**Voiced by**: Phil Harris; John Goodman

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #2: Maleficent

**Movie(s)**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**First Appearance**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**Voiced by**: Eleanor Audley

Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty' also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent's LIVE action form merited a sequel.

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo

**Movie(s)**: Dumbo (1941)

**First Appearance**: Dumbo (1941)

**Voiced by**: N/A

Dumbo joins the cast of cute and cuddly characters that manage to make an impact with little to no words! His amazing animation managed to convey his entire story despite his muteness, speaking to the great talent of his animators!

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #4: Coraline

**Movie(s)**: Coraline (2008)

**First Appearance**: Coraline (2008)

**Voiced by**: Dakota Fanning

Coraline's animation is certainly unique, but that's one of the reasons why she and her film stand out so much! In terms of **animated characters**, Coraline stands out with her unique design and equally unique story. She's certainly not a heroine that you should mess with!

Still on the Monster Inc train, we have Mike Wasowski! His refreshing character brought some levity into the story, bringing on some much-needed laughs and just, in general, providing a solid counterpart to Sulley!

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 12Toothless

**Movie(s)**: How To Train Your Dragon, How to Train your Dragon 2

**First Appearance**: How To Train Your Dragon

**Voiced by**: N/A

A more modern, but no-less loveable **animated character** that we all know and love is Toothless from 'How to Train Your Dragon!' Toothless, much like the almost-mute Wall-E, manages to charm the audience with nary a peep! Instead, everything about his character is portrayed in his emotions and his actions — which only speaks to the talent of the ones who had animated him into being.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 13Chihiro

**Movie(s)**: Spirited Away (2001)

**First Appearance**: Spirited Away (2001)

**Voiced by**: Rumi Hiragi, Daveigh Chase

The story of Chihiro from 'Spirited Away' is another memorable performance that one cannot easily forget! This character, if you weren't aware, was also created by Miyazaki (the same creator of 'Totoro!') She's a part of a long line of greatly designed and developed characters whose journey you just can't look away from.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 14Lumiere

**Movie(s)**: Beauty and the Beast (1991), The Enchanted Christmas (1997)

**First Appearance**: Beauty and the Beast (1991)

**Voiced by**: Jerry Orbach

'Beauty and the Beast' is a Disney classic! And, when it comes to beloved **Disney Animated Characters**, it certainly won with its own Lumiere (**Voiced by** Jerry Orbach!) This vivacious candelabra absolutely steals the show — bringing a little sass and musicality (after all, who cannot remember the 'Be Our Guest' track!) into the original inspiration for Belle and the Beast's love story.

**Related Movie Clips**:

### 15Sophie

**Movie(s)**: Howl's Moving Castle (2004)

**First Appearance**: Howl's Moving Castle (2004)

**Voiced by**: Chieko Baisho; Emily Mortimer & Jean Simmons

To wrap up our main list, we have another Miyazaki character in the form of Sophie — from Howl's Moving Castle! Howl's Moving Castle is another beautiful classic that you just can't help but love, and a lot of that is all thanks to its complex and believable heroine, Sophie!

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #1: Baloo

**Movie(s)**: The Jungle Book (1967), The Jungle Book 2 (2003)

**First Appearance**: The Jungle Book (1967)

**Voiced by**: Phil Harris; John Goodman

For the first of our honorable mentions, we have Baloo from 'The Jungle Book'! Baloo is soft and cuddly — perfectly loveable while providing sage advice for the main character! His performance in the film was certainly an unforgettable one (worth the repeat viewing!)

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #2: Maleficent

**Movie(s)**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**First Appearance**: Sleeping Beauty (1959)

**Voiced by**: Eleanor Audley

Maleficent from 'Sleeping Beauty' also deserves her own spot as an outstanding supervillain. One that, much like Cruella de Vil (who we introduced in the main list) inspired her own live-action film — or better yet, films! As Maleficent's LIVE action form merited a sequel.

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #3: Dumbo

**Movie(s)**: Dumbo (1941)

**First Appearance**: Dumbo (1941)

**Voiced by**: N/A

Dumbo joins the cast of cute and cuddly characters that manage to make an impact with little to no words! His amazing animation managed to convey his entire story despite his muteness, speaking to the great talent of his animators!

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #4: Coraline

**Movie(s)**: Coraline (2008)

**First Appearance**: Coraline (2008)

**Voiced by**: Dakota Fanning

Coraline's animation is certainly unique, but that's one of the reasons why she and her film stand out so much! In terms of **animated characters**, Coraline stands out with her unique design and equally unique story. She's certainly not a heroine that you should mess with!

**Related Movie Clips**:

**●** Honorable Mention #5: Jack Skellington

**Movie(s)**: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)

**First Appearance**: The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)

**Voiced by**: Chris Sarandon, Henry Sellick (singing)

Although Jack Skellington's film, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' may not be as well known as others, those that do know of it speak well of his character! His complex personality gives way for a very interesting tale, one that has captivated many an audience and merited repeat viewings (perfect for the holiday season!)
