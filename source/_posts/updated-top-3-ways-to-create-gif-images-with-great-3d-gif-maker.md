If what you’re searching for is a **3D GIF Maker**, then we’ve got your back. Below, we’ve not only listed the three best ways to create 3D animated GIFs, but we’ve also included a brief tutorial that you can reference when creating your very own GIF images.

## Part 1 Best 3 Ways to Create 3D Animated GIFs

First off, as promised, we have a brief list of some **3D GIF Maker** tools that you can try. We’ve made sure to pick a unique set of **3D GIF Maker** tools and **3D GIF Generator** tools in order to give you a variety to choose from. It won’t be the most comprehensive list, but it should help you on your way to understanding how these 3D GIF makers usually work and how you can use them in order to create GIF images that you can share with your friends, family, and colleagues.

### 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first **3D GIF Maker** on our list is Filmora. It’s probably not the first one that you’d naturally think of as a **3D GIF Maker**, seeing as it was developed to be more than that. But, it doesn’t discount the fact that it can be used in order to create and edit your own GIFs.

 **Wondershare Filmora is available for both Windows and Mac users. It allows you to create a GIF with images or video easily and even gives you the tools needed to edit and perfect it before you export it for use (a process that we’ll be showing off in more detail in the tutorial section below if you’re interested in learning more.)**

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

For macOS 10.12 or later

### 022\. Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop, much like Filmora, is probably not, first and foremost, considered a mere **3D GIF Maker**. However, it doesn’t erase its 3D GIF Creator functions. This tool, if used correctly, can make just about anything you want.

The process of using it, of course, is a little fussier than other alternatives (you’ll probably want to look up a more detailed explanation on the subject), but the fussiness does also mean that you can control every detail of your project and get it to look exactly how you want it to look.

### 03EaseUS Video Editor

Similar to Filmora, EaseUS Video Editor is an advanced video editing tool that you can use as a **3D GIF Creator** quite easily. It comes built-in with templates, filters, design elements, transition effects, music, and so much more — allowing you to freely design your GIF images so that they can be ready for publishing right off the bat.

The beauty of it, of course, is that, much like with all the other options that we introduced today, you can use the program for more than just 3D GIF creation after the fact — opening yourself up for different and more complex projects in the future (be they image, audio, or video-related.)

## Part 2 Create 3D Animated Gifs Online With **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

Now, as promised, we’ve also included a tutorial that you can follow along with to create your own 3D Animated GIFs with the tool, **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. With this tool, we’ll be showing you the basic way to do it (by using a premade video that you can edit and then convert into GIF format). But, feel free to explore the tool and use it as you wish (i.e., as a **3D spinning GIF creator, 3D rotating text GIF maker, 3D cube GIF maker**, and so on.)

### 01Step 1: Launch **[Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

First things first, launch the **3D GIF maker** that you intend to use. In our case, that is Filmora (a screenshot has been provided below for your edification and reference. We’ll be using Filmora as our example.)

![Download, Install, and Launch Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-3-ways-to-create-gif-images-with-great-3d-gif-maker4.png)

### 02Step 2: Upload File(s)

Next, upload the file or files that you want to turn into a GIF.

As mentioned in the introduction, we’ll be using a pre-made video, but you can use whatever you wish (i.e., images). In order to upload, we clicked the File tab (pointed out in the image below) and selected Import Media > Import Media File. However, you can also drag and drop your file(s) on the designated area of the UI..

![Upload Files to Create GIF](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/top-3-ways-to-create-gif-images-with-great-3d-gif-maker5.png)

### 03Step 3: Drag Uploaded Media to Timeline

To create a GIF withFilmora , you’ll need to first create a video. Don’t worry, this is simple. Just drag and drop the media that you want to use onto the timeline.

Note: Any uploaded media will be in the media folder (marked \[1\] in the image below). Drag media from there onto the timeline (marked \[2\] in the image below) in order to create a video.

### 04Step 4: (Optional) Edit Video

If you want, take this opportunity to work on your video some more before converting it into a GIF. Filmora is set up to help you with this. Providing all the following features:

**●**Trim or Cut features to trim down the video.

**●**Add Text or audio to video.

**●**Use templates, filters, or other elements to design videos.

**●**Add transitions for better video flow.

And then some. In our case, we used the ‘Trim’ feature to cut down our video for a cleaner look.

### 05Step 5: Create Video > GIF

Once you’re done editing your video, you can now convert it to a GIF.

This is easy enough to do. Just click the ‘Export’ tab and select the ‘Create Video’ option. That will allow you to choose to convert your finished video into a GIF file that you can share with your friends.

## Techniques for Making After Effects 2D Animation

Blender is a widely popular animation tool that designers primarily use to create 3D animations. It offers a full-scale editing panel and a plethora of features that allow designers to create visually enticing 3D animations for videos, games, and marketing purposes. But, can you use Blender to create 2D animations? Even though the tool is marketed as a 3D animation creator, it's worth noting that one can use it for 2D animations as well. Now, the process may not be as straightforward as using a dedicated 2D animation creator, you can still get the job done using Blender. This will be pretty helpful if you are already a Blender user and want to create 2D animations for a project.

To help you along the way, we have put together a detailed guide on how to create Blender 2D animations and use them in your videos to make them look more stunning. So, without any further ado, let's get started.

## Part 1 Is Blender 2D Animation As Awesome AS 3D?

There's no arguing the fact that Blender is a remarkable tool for 3D animations. Its worldwide popularity is clear proof of what one can achieve while creating a 3D animation with Blender. But, the real question is - are Blender 2D animations as good as their 3D alternatives. Well, the answer is Yes! Blender has a built-in feature known as Grease Pencil that's specifically designed to create 2D animations. With Grease Pencil, you can create different 2D layouts from scratch and turn them into visually appealing animations to engage the potential viewers.

## Part 2 How to Mix 2D & 3D Animation in Blender?

So, how can you create 2D animations in Blender? Well, it depends! The process to create a 2D animation in Blender mainly depends on what you want to design. You can find different Blender 2D animation tutorials on YouTube and use them to get started with 2D animations in Blender. But, we would like to point out that there's a generic process that'll remain consistent in every situation. If you are also getting started with creating 2D animations in Blender, here's the step-by-step process that'll help you start sailing in the right direction and make the 2D animation designing a hassle-free task.

##### Step 1

First and foremost, launch Blender on your system and set it up to get started. On the home screen, click on "File>New" and then, select "2D Animation".

![file new blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-1.jpg)

Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.

![design image blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-2.jpg)

##### Step 3

The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.

##### Step 4

After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.

![array modifier blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-3.jpg)

##### Step 5

Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you've drawn on the screen and then, select "Rotation and Scale". A separate editing window will pop up on your screen. Here you can customize the movement of the object by changing its scaling options through keyframing.

That's it; your 2D animation is now ready and you can save it on your computer.

Now, click on the Grease Pencil tool and use it to draw any shape on the canvas. If you want to add multiple objects to the animation, you can also draw multiple shapes.

![design image blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-2.jpg)

##### Step 3

The next step would be to apply the array modifier to these shapes, considering you want to add a specific movement to them. So, add an array modifier first and then apply it over the desired shapes.

##### Step 4

After you have applied the array modifier, go ahead and start adding colors to the animation. Keep in mind the more colors you use, the better the Blender 2D animation will appear at the end.

![array modifier blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/is-blender-2d-animation-as-awesome-as-3d-3.jpg)

##### Step 5

Now, through the editing panel, right-click on the shape you've drawn on the screen and then, select "Rotation and Scale". A separate editing window will pop up on your screen. Here you can customize the movement of the object by changing its scaling options through keyframing.

That's it; your 2D animation is now ready and you can save it on your computer.

Now, ideally, Unity is considered to be a suitable tool for 3D games that have too many animated elements. But, this doesn't mean that you cannot design **2D animations with Unity**.

In this guide, we are going to show you how to get started with 2D animations in Unity and incorporate them into your games to enhance the overall gameplay.

#### In this article

01 [Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Can Unity Be Used for 2D Animation?

First, things first; can Unity be used for 2D animations. The answer is Yes! Being a full-scale gaming engine, developers/designers can use Unity to create stunning **Unity 2D animations** for their games. The tool has dedicated 2D animation packages that contain all the elements you'll need to create high-quality 2D animations for your games.

Keep in mind that for each object, you'll have to create a separate 2D sprite sheet and use it to configure the 2D animation. However, there are other 2D animation packages that you can install, using sprite sheets is the most common method to get the job done. The latest versions of Unity also offer a dedicated Stripe library where you can add multiple Stripe Sheets and it becomes relatively easier to manage them.

With the Sprite library, **2D animations with Unity** becomes a hassle-free job. Designers can even manage dozens of 2D animations without any hassle. The Sprite editor will also let you control the overall movement of different moving objects in your animation and make it look more sleek. In general, if you are planning to create 2D animations for your videos or even a dedicated mobile game, Unity can be a suitable software for the job.

## Part 2 How Do You Make a 2D Animation in Unity?

To create a **2D animation with Unity,** the first step would be to create a dedicated Sprite sheet. Now, you can use a wide variety of third-party programs to create the desired Sprite sheet. In general, it depends on the project requirements and the personal preferences of the designer himself. However, whichever tool you use to create the Stripe sheets, make sure that the final image is a transparent PNG file as it'll make your job much easier while animating objects in Unity.

After you have successfully designed the stripe (a transparent image file) in an external application, the next step would be to import it to Unity. When you import the Stripe file, make sure to create a separate Sprite folder so that you can easily manage all these files in one place. Also, a dedicated Stripe folder will allow you to keep a check on each Stripe file in a hassle-free manner.

![import object unity 2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/beginner-tutorial-on-making-unity-2d-animation-1.jpg)

Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.

| Features/Type of Animation | 2D Animation                                                                                               | 3D Animation                                                                                               |

Creating an animation requires multiple processes and tasks to get that final result that we enjoy on the screen. Irrespective of the type of animations like stop-motion, sketch, computer, and others, all of them majorly falls under two main categories- 2D animation and 3D animation. The popular cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom & Jerry, and others that became an integral part of all childhood were 2D animations and with technological advancement and 3D animation in use, they are more like aged-veterans.

## Part 1 Part Definition Of 2D And 3D Animation

### 012D Animation

The traditional method of animation is termed 2D animation and it has been in use for a long time. A 2D animated video has multiple images in different positions which when moved quickly one after the other simulates a movement. The flipping of the images creates an illusion of movement. Earlier 2D animations were created using hands but now there is advanced computer software that can create these animations in just a few simple clicks. The term 2D means 2 dimensional which means that an image for the animation can be moved in two-dimensional space that is X-axis and Y-axis.

### 023D Animation

In simplest terms, a 3D animation is an animation that is created in three-dimensional space which makes the characters and objects appear realistic and lively. Thus, a 3D animation has height, width as well as depth. These animations are more complex and the process of creating them is totally different from that of 2D animations. Though 3D animations are used in different industries and platforms these days, majorly they can be found for creating movies, games, and cartoons.

## Part 2 Part Key Differences Between 2d Animations and 3d Animations

The major difference between a 2D animation and 3D animation lies in the final appearance. While a 2D animation appears like a flat animation which can be an image or a photograph at a fast movement while a 3D animation looks like real objects that can be seen from all angles and have their front, back, top, as well as the bottom.

The table below will differentiate both these animations on various parameters.
