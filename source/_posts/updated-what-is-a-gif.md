## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

![2d animaiton reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reference.JPG)

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

![animation tips simplicity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simplicity.JPG)

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

![2D draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/draw-animation.jpg)

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

![feedback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feedback.JPG)

## Part 2: 3D Animation Tips for Beginners

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

![focus your frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-your-frame.JPG)

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

![ criticism](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/criticism.JPG)

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

![3D animation tips model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/model.JPG)

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

You can learn animation on your own, but that's not the best way. We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Conclusion

By taking the above animation tips, you can create engaging, inspiring, and unforgettable animations that will captivate your audience. Why not get started following these animation tips right now?

Animation is a skill that you need years to practice. However, the learning process can be boosted if you master some animation tips. If you’re looking for great 2D/3D animation tips and tricks, this is what we will offer here.

There are some overlaps between 2D and 3D animation tips like practicing and object pose, but in essence, animation tips can be learned commonly.

These animation tips will help you make your 2D and 3D animations as bold and creative as possible, while reduce your workload and enable you to get your work out into the world quicker with [excellent animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Let’s take a look at the top 10 **2D/3D animation tips and tricks** right now.

## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

![2d animaiton reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reference.JPG)

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

![animation tips simplicity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simplicity.JPG)

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

![2D draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/draw-animation.jpg)

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

![feedback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feedback.JPG)

## Part 2: 3D Animation Tips for Beginners

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

![focus your frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-your-frame.JPG)

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

![ criticism](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/criticism.JPG)

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

![3D animation tips model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/model.JPG)

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

You can learn animation on your own, but that's not the best way. We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Conclusion

By taking the above animation tips, you can create engaging, inspiring, and unforgettable animations that will captivate your audience. Why not get started following these animation tips right now?

We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There's a surprisingly large amount of both **caricature photo maker** apps and **online caricature maker** tools.

Today, we'll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we've even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to **make a caricature of a photo**.

#### In this article

01 [The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects](#Part 1)

02 [How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

![MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330>

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743>

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voil%C3%A0-ai-artist-cartoon-photo/id1558421405>

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/caricature-hyper-face-morph-from-photos-camera-shots/id587429629>

![Caricature Hyper Face Morph Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cartoon-caricature-face-camera/id1424277519>

![Cartoon Caricature Face Camera Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects9.png)

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-distortion-screw-up-your-face/id1188623179>

![Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects10.png)

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Caricature is now possible in an instant with the use of a **caricature maker** app. These tools render an existing photograph with the use of filters and effects to create a **caricature sketch** worthy of any artist's skill.

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.

We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There's a surprisingly large amount of both **caricature photo maker** apps and **online caricature maker** tools.

Today, we'll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we've even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to **make a caricature of a photo**.

02 [How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330>

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743>

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voil%C3%A0-ai-artist-cartoon-photo/id1558421405>

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

![Caricature Hyper Face Morph Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

She keeps her sadistic character in check to be in power which is very scary and dangerous for someone with power. She unleashing her cruelty on defenseless people is another thing that makes her a perfect scary anime girl.

### 7\. Himiko Toga (My Hero Academia)

Himiko is a cute-looking girl that possesses the ability to shapeshift to anything she wants. The creepy part is, in order to shapeshift she has to ingest another person’s blood.

Though Himiko appears to be a typical funny school girl, she can turn into a murderous beast in the blink of an eye. Her twister view of relationships and her trying to befriend people while trying to kill them at the same time all give us creepy chills while watching the anime.

### 8\. Hana Midorikawa (Prison School)

Though Hana Midorikawa looks very cute and innocent she is as creepy as any girl can get. The story evolves in an underground prison school which is an explainable aspect that made Hana the sadist she is.

At first, Hana might seem to be a cute girl who does not belong at the place she currently is, but going deeper the opinion of the audience changes extremely. Hana happens to be a violent sociopath with a lot of dangerous thoughts and a urination fetish, and that is just the beginning of her creepiness.

### 9\. Isabella (The Promised Neverland)

Isabella who is also known as Mama is one of the main characters in the Promised Land. Being a caretaker to children, though she appears to be loving and affectionate to her children, that’s not the real case.

Isabella has a twisted character and shows detachment to her tragedies. This character shows antagonism, betrayal, and a twisted nature enough for the fans to feel creepy about her.

![isabella-scary-anime-girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-isabella-scary-anime-girl.jpg)

### 10\. Lucy (Elfen Lied)

Lucy in Elfen Lied is a character that sometimes gets sympathy and other times creeps the audience out. She has difficulty drawing a line between good and evil. She can be seen as being sadistically tormented and ruthlessly tormenting about the cruelty around her.

Her surroundings and the people are responsible for how she is and that is why despite being creepy she is loved by a lot of people.

### Final thoughts

Though most animes are fun to watch, horror animes are also enjoyed by a lot of people. The main aspect of these horror animes is the scary characters that make the audience wonder.

We have listed the top 10 scary anime girls of different animes that are equally liked and hated by the audience all over the world. The way they act, their cruelty, sadism all define their scary character. These scary anime girls have created such a huge impact that a fan might forget the anime name but never the name of the scary anime girl who gives him/her chills all over the body.

**There are a number of ways you can use to animate still images →**

**●** Videos are multiple pictures that move at a frame rate. Make short copies of a video by cutting out the essential moments and playing them in a loop.

**●** Add and play video animation elements over a picture. With the right software, this task is as easy as copy-pasting over another image.

**●** Apply an animated 3D image with a transparent background over another image. Remember, the bigger the element the closer it is. So size is directly translated as distance.
