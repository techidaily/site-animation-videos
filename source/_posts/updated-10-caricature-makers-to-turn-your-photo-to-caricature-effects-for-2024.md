We certainly have a couple of recommendations to offer to you. There's a surprisingly large amount of both **caricature photo maker** apps and **online caricature maker** tools.

Today, we'll be focusing on the apps, to keep things easily accessible. And, in the end, we've even included a quick step-by-step guide on how to **make a caricature of a photo**.

#### In this article

01 [The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects](#Part 1)

02 [How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

![Color Cartoon Caricature Maker Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects2.png)

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/picmagic-cartoon-photo-editor/id1491645007>

![PicMagic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects3.png)

### 04**Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI**

This next app, called 'Photic' is much like our previously listed app, PicMagic. As you can see from the image provided, it can **make a caricature of a photo** but in a subtle way that is undeniably more of a 'cartoony' style than what you might be looking for. Keep that in mind.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/photic-cartoon-yourself-ai/id1484108330>

![Photic - Cartoon Yourself AI Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects4.png)

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/toonapp-cartoon-photo-editor/id1540719743>

![ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects5.png)

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

![Caricature Hyper Face Morph Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects7.png)

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

![Face Caricature - Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects8.png)

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/cartoon-caricature-face-camera/id1424277519>

![Cartoon Caricature Face Camera Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects9.png)

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-distortion-screw-up-your-face/id1188623179>

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Photo to Caricature is now possible in an instant with the use of a **caricature maker** app. These tools render an existing photograph with the use of filters and effects to create a **caricature sketch** worthy of any artist's skill.

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.

The best part of it is that you can use it along with iMessage — making it very easy to share your finished **caricature pictures** with friends and family. The downside? It is best used for solo picture caricature-like only.

### 05**ToonApp Cartoon Photo Editor**

'ToonApp' is the next **caricature maker** on our list. As you can see from the image provided, the style of caricature is a lot more realistic here. Very similar to what you normally see of western comics (which only subtly changes the features of a person to look more rendered.) The best part of this app? Well, unlike some of the other options on this list, it works great for group pictures.

### 06**Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo**

This next app is very similar to the previous one we introduced. It's called 'Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo' and the main difference between it and the ToonApp app that we introduced earlier is that it uses a different caricature style. Not unlike what you see from 3D animations — which is a mix of realism and cartoony.

This tool, much like a lot of other alternatives, is best used for selfies.

![Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo Application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-6effects6.jpg)

### 07**Caricature Hyper Face Morph**

Now we go back to what most people usually consider 'caricature' with the 'Caricature Hyper Face Morph' app. This app, as you can see from the image below, allows you to morph a photograph into something more exaggerated (turning it into a true-to-form caricature; like what you would see in **political caricature** segments in newspapers or old animated short films.)

It works for group photographs surprisingly well as well. With the AI recognizing and applying the 'morph' effect to everyone.

### 08**Face Caricature**

The next **caricature maker** on our list is the app called 'Face Caricature.' The best part of this app, undoubtedly, is the fact that it offers several 'caricature' styles that you can choose from. So, you aren't stuck with just one cartoon style. It's better for selfies, however — it doesn't work as well as a group picture **caricature maker**.

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/face-caricature-cartoon-photo/id1007143753>

### 09**Cartoon Caricature Face Camera**

This is a camera tool that you can use in order to take photographs and turn them into caricatures. There are several caricature art styles for you to choose from, which are always fun. Plus, it offers easy save-and-share features. As a final note, this app works best as a selfie app.

### 10**Face Distortion - Screw Up Your Face**

Though this app isn't exactly a '**caricature maker**' it does work like one. It's just a matter of finding the right distortive effect to mimic the look of an actual **caricature sketch**. The best part about it is that it's basically a custom **caricature maker** — one that allows you to control exactly what features are exaggerated.

## Part 2 **How to Draw a Caricature — Step by Step Guide**

Now for our promised tutorial. Here, we introduce a quick and easy way to draw caricatures. Take it more as an overview of what exactly caricatures are and how you can create them by following a specific set of steps. Ah, but of course, just to make sure that you are getting something out of it, we've also included a recommendation for a tool that you can use in order to step up your caricature creation.

**Step 1: Get a Reference Photo.**

Any good caricature starts with a good reference photo. If you're not familiar with the term, a reference photo is basically any photograph that you use in order to draw inspiration from.

When making a caricature, that usually means finding a portrait (like the one below) that you can directly refer to when making your **caricature sketch**.

![Find a Portrait for Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects11.png)

**Step 2: Exaggerate Features.**

What is the point of caricatures? Well, it all comes down to the exaggeration of features. Whether that's enlarging the person's head to be half the size of a person or distorting the features of their face to make one more prominent than another. There's an endless number of ways you can go about doing it.

Just remember, when making a caricature sketch, there are no such things as rules. While you do have a reference photo in front of you, you don't have to draw it exactly as you see it. Make the eyes farther apart, exaggerate the lift of the eyebrows, give them a teeny tiny nose, etc., etc..

Just let your imagination run wild.

![Exaggerate the Features of Your Reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/10-caricature-makers-to-turn-your-photo-to-caricature-effects12.png)

**Step 3: Find a Reliable Tool.**

And, finally, if you really want to take your caricatures to the next level, consider animating them. That is the main point of caricatures, after all.

And, if you're going to go about doing such a thing, make sure that you have a reliable tool on your side. For example, having something like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, a video editor that has an endless amount of presets and effects that you can choose from, may prove to be exactly what you need to get to the next stage of your caricature creation.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** There's a lot of these caricature makers for you to choose from as well. Proven by the fact that we were able to easily find at least ten — all of which you can use (some in different ways) to transform your photographs into caricature works.

**●** Of course, if you want to take the traditional route and draw caricatures yourself, that's possible too. Just remember the three tips that we outlined above: get a reference, exaggerate, and use good tools.

## Part 1 **The 10 Best Makers to Turn Photos to Caricature Effects**

As promised, part one of this article is devoted to a list of the 10 best **caricature maker** apps that we can find. We'll be focusing on the Apple App Store, in this case, but it's important to note that most of these are available on the Google play store as well. (A link to the app has been provided for your convenience as well.)

### 01**1\. MomentCam Cartoons & Stickers**

The first of the **caricature maker** apps on our list is 'MomentCam Cartoon & Stickers' — this app is part of another tool called 'Avatar Maker Bundle', but it can be used on its own to create caricature versions of yourself that you can use to express emotions (an avatar, if you will).

This app was made primarily to help the user to create an avatar that matches their look (with accessorization features to complete the set). However, you can interact with other members of the community to create multiple avatars if you wish. Or, you can share your **caricature pictures** on social media.

### 02**Color Cartoon Caricature Maker**

This next **caricature maker** app uses a more realistic style akin to what is usually used for a **political caricature** of famous individuals and politicians. It's called 'Color Cartoon Caricature Maker' and, while not as extensive in its features as the previous app, it can be used to turn an image completely into a caricature (which means that it can be used for photographs with more than one person or focus.)

URL: <https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/color-cartoon-caricature-maker/id1448093448>

### 03**PicMagic- Cartoon Photo Editor**

Up next, we have 'Pic Magic' which is better described as a 'cartoon photo editor' but still works as a serviceable **caricature maker** if all you're looking for is a subtle enhancement of features (unlike what was shown in the **political caricature** maker we showed previously.)

Much like the second app, while it's more suitable for enhancing the features of one person, it does work for group pictures as well.

So, let's move ahead as this content will show you different **cartoon drawing styles**, and in no time, you'll master the art.

01 [15 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project](#Part 1)

02 [How To Draw Myself In Five Different Cartoon Styles](#Part 2)

## Part 1 Types of Cartoon You May Use for Your Next Marketing Project

As I've mentioned before, there are various types and styles of cartoon drawings. Below are a few cartoon drawing styles you may want to use for your next project.

### 01Modern Cartoon Style

This style is currently the most common art style displayed on TV channels like Cartoon Network.

Note that this **cartoon-style drawing's** main features are the thick outlines, geometric shapes, and bright colors.

One of the significant reasons this drawing style is this way is that using simple shapes without much detail makes the overall animation process much faster and saves resources for the studios. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful and captivating **cartoon drawing style**!

This drawing style is used by many modern cartoons. Here are a few examples:

**●** The Powerpuff Girls

**●** Dexter's Laboratory

**●** Codename: Kids Next Door

**●** Gravity Falls

### 02Realistic Cartoon Style

This **cartoon drawing style** is more quirky since, generally, cartoon drawing is more likely to simplify shapes. The realistic **cartoon-style drawing** adds more details and keeps figures much more in line with reality. This drawing style is typical among artists who vectorize people's photographs.

You can also, to some extent, include Caricatures in this category. Caricatures are generally very realistic besides the whole enlargement and shrinking of specific body parts!

Few examples of realistic cartoon drawing styles:

**●** Ugly Americans

**●** General Caricataures

**●** Archer

### 03Modern Anime

This style tends to be more complex, primarily seen in drawings where the characters seem to be in motion, like in comic books. Modern-day drawings of this style have a lot of shadows and highlights in their character and environment, giving them a relatively new level of complexity.

Here are a few examples of modern animes that follow this Japanese **cartoon drawing style**.

**●** My Hero Academia

**●** Sword Art Online

**●** Attack on Titan

**●** Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood

### 04Classic Manga

The old Japanese manga characters tend to possess human-like attributes (proportions) in terms of the body. The difference is the big eyes they have the most time.

Generally, this **cartoon drawing style** focuses more on feminine bodies, possessing angular chins and thin bodies. Some drawing styles tend to make some parts of the body overtly long compared to the rest of the body; for instance, the legs are mostly longer than other parts.

A few examples of classic manga possessing this **cartoon style drawing** are:

**●** Oh My Goddess

**●** Urusei Yatsura

**●** Sailor Moon

**●** Hellsing

### 05Chibi Drawing Style

The Chibi **Cartoon Drawing Style** mainly focuses on making the characters into a tiny version of themselves as if being compressed or compacted into a small container.

Examples of where this drawing style is used:

**●** Lucky Star

**●** Bottle Fairy

**●** Himouto! Umaru-chan

### 06The Simpsons Cartoon Drawing Style

This **cartoon-style drawing** is widely famous. Though this style has undergone some evolution throughout the years, the main features remained constant! That is to say, the yellow bodies and big and white sphere-like eyes remained.

### 07Classic Disney

This drawing style was a staple for years, though this drawing style has had an evolutionary cartoon drawing style over the years.

### 08Mid 20th Century Disney

Disney upped their game during the mid 20th century and started working more with live actors, drawing from references, and filming shots before drawing the cartoons.

Some remarkable examples of this **cartoon drawing style** are

**●** Alice in Wonderland

**●** Cinderella

**●** Beauty and the Beast

### 09Modern Disney Drawing Style

This **cartoon-style drawing** is an immediate improvement of the mid-20th 20th drawing style. This cartoon style is brighter, more detailed, and more complex generally.

Although Disney has stopped creating 2D cartoon drawings, there are still some examples of this more refined art style:

**●** The Princess and the Frog

**●** Lilo and Stitch

### 10Old Cartoon Drawing Style

This drawing style is mostly in black and white format, with very high contrast body parts. The features of this style are having short bodies and long limbs. Sometimes, this type of drawing is referred to as Noodle drawing because the character's body moves as if there are no bones in their body.

Some examples of this **cartoon drawing** **style** include:

**●** Mickey Mouse

**●** Betty Boop

### 11South Park

South Park **cartoon drawing style** is aptly geometric and has little depth. Shadows or highlights in this cartoon-style are rare. The colors are pretty solid and clean.

### 12Chrono Trigger/ Dragon Ball (Akira Toriyama)

Akira Toriyama's **cartoon drawing style** characterizes having big and almost rectangular eyes and a lot of geometric shapes and definitions in the muscles.

### 13Crayon Shin-Chan

This **cartoon-style drawing** is effortless. An exciting aspect of this style is that it doesn't mind pushing the limits of the character.

The lines generally are thin, and the eyes are prominent in black and white colors.

### 14Betty Boop

 Betty Boop's **cartoon drawing style** possesses contrasting black and white colors. Fragile lines with the characters contain a very high amount of black shapes.

### 15Adventure Time

Adventure Time's art is incredibly geometric, and its characters are nearly boneless, making it a more current example of a cartoon drawing style.

More fluid animation is possible as a result of this. The art is also quite brilliant, with vibrant hues that leap off the screen.

Aside from that, the characters' eyes are usually tiny (with a few exceptions), and the lines are skinny.

## Part 2 How to draw myself in five different cartoon styles

There are loads of cartoon characters to choose from when trying to draw me. To sketch yourself as a cartoon, first, you have to determine what **cartoon drawing style** to appear in. This will give you hints on how to go about the drawing.

**●** The traditional drawing method is a pencil and paper.

**●** Online Avatar builders

**●** Adobe character animator

**●** Outsource to designers or illustrators

**●** Hire a studio or a freelancer

In the following section of this article, let us keep our focus on learning about some of the most amazing tips and tricks to upgrade your Insta story slideshow to the next level:

**●** **A Compact Photo Album**

Do you land among those social media freaks how want to share just every moment of your day with your peers, or are you confused on selecting the best photos and videos of a cherished event, vacation or bringing home a new utility and end up posting a heap of media on your social media handles?

You can use the feature to create a collection of amazing videos as well and share it too with your friends on social media without the guilt of becoming a feed-hog.

Want a practical experience of using Instagram slideshows? See through the following tutorial to understand the exact creation process:

**Step 1: Choose the First Image**

Begin with selecting the first image for your slideshow, just as you would ideally do for a normal, single image Instagram feed and long press the same.

**Step 2: Confirming the Selection**

Navigate to the bottom right corner of your selected image to locate a button similar to a photo slideshow. Tap the button to see a ‘1’ inscribed in a blue circle appear on your chosen image.

**Step 3: Make Further Selections**

You can now proceed to select other images or videos for the slideshow, in a similar fashion as the first one. You are allowed to include a maximum of 10 media files within the slideshow.

**Step 4: Customize Your Creation**

Tap the ‘Next’ button when you have finished making the required selections. The editor interface will now open to let you customize the selected images with a series of effects and filters, both one at a time, as well as the entire set altogether. You can also work with modifying the order of appearance of the photos and videos if required.

**Step 5: The Final Touches**

Once you are done with the editing process, continue to follow the remaining steps, as you would do to create a normal Instagram post. You can include captions, locations and tag your peers on the platform.

**Step 6: Time to Share!**

Your Instagram slideshow is ready to be posted. Upload it either to your feed or story to receive a hoard of likes and comments!

**●** **Animated Text Overlays**

If your Instagram story slideshows are missing out on the visual spunk, try complimenting their images and videos with animated transitions and text overlays. Short and quick animations are the best ways to enhance a slideshow story with an eye catching effect. Applying a variety of text overlays would help to keep the audience curious about the next visual delight.

**●** **Prefer a Vertical Aspect Ratio**

While the landscape mode tends to ward off certain portions of the visual media from a slideshow being played across multiple sized screens, using the portrait mode with a vertical aspect ratio suits best to almost every screen size. Taking care of this fact will ensure that your audience does not get distracted with the semi visible contents of the slideshow story.

**●** **Choose Your Editing Effects Wisely**

Regardless of the slideshow creation tool you prefer, there are a diversity of effects, templates, design elements and filters to uplift your craft with the perfect look. However, you should be cautious enough while making your choice so that the balance of colors, fonts and themes is affordably maintained, lest you would end up with a messy and loud Instagram story slideshow, that would not gather much appeal.

Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the "Sound." Now select the sound that you wish to add.

Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between "No Sync" to "AV Sync" in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.

### 05Step 5: Rendering

Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.

Initially, click on "scene" and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as "WebM" and video Codec as "WEBM/VP9\. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to "Vorbis." Choose output quality and speed.

After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select "Render Animation" in **Blender Animation**.

The answer to if the Blender is suitable for animation is yes. **Blender animation** is the best for making animations and bringing any living to animator. This software is mostly for professional works whose limitations will be learning the process, not any technical defects. Let's talk about why **Blender 3D animation software** is the best and more helpful.

Character animation is an essential tool for animation, and Blender has developed this tool with no way less to other software.

There are many animation effects other than animating characters. **Blender 3D for free** has all the necessary tools to do all types of rigs and animations without any difficulty.

Blender is one software that has 2D animation inbuilt in it, like drawing and creating 2D animation.

### 01Step 1: Importing

Initially, import a **Blender 3D** **animation** character into the Blender to animate. Many free and paid characters are available in Vincent, and Rain v2.0 is present in Blender Cloud; above all, these characters are for free.

Steps to import the character either from Vincent or Rain v2.0

### 02Step 2: Add Keyframes

There will be a diamond-shaped icon below to choose the keyframe you want to add to the timeline, which you may also delete.

Adding a keyframe is simple. Open the timeline window in the animation editor. Press the alphabet 'G' on the keyboard, move the bone and place it. Then hit Shift+I and choose the channel LocRot and insert the keyframe. Likewise, you can adjust the keyframe by dragging, making it fast or slow to the requirements.

Moving the keyframe to 20 makes it faster, and moving to 40, slower.

### 03Step 3: Get Reference Materials

It will be challenging to add movements to the characters, so plenty of videos can get the moves right. There are various reference images and videos available on the Internet. You can either add the selected reference materials to the second screen or add them to the 3D space. Let's discuss how to add it.

Hit Shift + A to add the reference material. Later select "Image" and then choose the "Background." Scale the reference image onto the 3D space after it loads.

Afterward, you can leave it to the animation of the reference article, or you can further edit or amplify the movements.

### 04Step 4: Fine–Tuning and Sound

This step will add smooth movements by combining two keyframes for a more professional look. We have to use the Dope sheet to do complete this process. Let's see how to add it.

Initially, split the window horizontally. Later switch over the dope sheet below the animation tab, where you can see keyframes of all axis. Now you can drag and edit to slow or amplify the speed.

There is a Graphic editor, which is more advanced to make the movements more accurately and directly to edit the curves.

Sound effects make any video or animation better. You can add and import the sound files. You can also create your sound and insert it into the Blender. Let's discuss adding sound and making it sync to the character.

Download the audio file, hit shift + A to open Add menu, and choose the "Sound." Now select the sound that you wish to add.

Drag the sound to keep it to the specific sections alone. Also, you can switch between "No Sync" to "AV Sync" in the playback to give the best synchronization to the characters. The volume and pitch can be adjusted using the sidebar.

### 05Step 5: Rendering

Before rendering, make sure you keep the FPS is same as that chosen during the keyframes to avoid unnecessary renders. After setting the frame correctly, causing the animation is easy.

Initially, click on "scene" and choose the file extension, file formats, and file colors (BW, RGB, or RGBA). Select the encoding container as "WebM" and video Codec as "WEBM/VP9\. After adding the sound, set the audio codec to "Vorbis." Choose output quality and speed.

After all the rendering, select Render from the top bar and select "Render Animation" in **Blender Animation**.

Awesome! We have successfully blended a character using **Blender 3D animation software**. With more practice and knowledge about more tools, one can easily use the **Blender 3D mouse**.

## Part 2 **How Gif Animation Maker Affect Your Marketing**

Alright, now that you've been introduced to what we consider the best **GIF Animation maker** tools available right now (be they software or online tools), we can move on to actually discussing how you can use GIFs for your marketing efforts We've compiled six different ways here, but there are plenty of others, of course. It's a very open subject.

### 01**GIFs Are Easy to Share Ads**

The best part of GIFs is that they are easily consumable media that you can share just about everywhere. For example, you can include them in your email marketing to bring a little life to what could have otherwise been a very dry message You can also have it play out on social media without prompting (different from videos, which the user usually has to play before it starts going.)

![Easy-to-Shared Ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/6-unexpected-ways-gif-animation-maker-can-affect-your-marketing6.gif)

### 02**GIFs Can Be Used for Promoting Events**

GIFs are also great for promoting events or holiday sales It's basically just a moving 2D advertisement (like the one that is shown below). Eye-catching in a way that keeps you looking to catch the movement — in compared to if you were just looking at a still image (which might catch your attention for a moment, but usually bores you the next)

![Animated Advertisements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/6-unexpected-ways-gif-animation-maker-can-affect-your-marketing7.gif)

### 03**GIFs Can Be Used for Call-to-Action Pop-Ups**

Perhaps you've seen this already in some YouTube videos (see the GIF attached for an example), but a lot of content creators now include GIFs on their content to prompt their audience to complete an action — be it subscribing, sharing, downloading a link, buying a product, etc. It's a great way of getting a message across in a way that is both fun and straightforward

![Subscribe GIF](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/6-unexpected-ways-gif-animation-maker-can-affect-your-marketing8.gif)

### 04**GIFs Can Be Used to Set the Scene and Express Emotion**

GIFs are also a great way to just generally set the scene or express emotion. Text is…very very difficult to make sound like anything but dry reading. Pictures are a little better, but GIFs??? Well, GIFs are great ‘moving' pictures that offer you more leeway to set the scene by expressing emotion, intent, etc.

![Express Emotion or Set the Scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/6-unexpected-ways-gif-animation-maker-can-affect-your-marketing9.gif)

### 05**GIFs Can Be Used to Tell a Story**

You know the saying, "A picture can speak a thousand words?" Well, it's true, but in comparison to GIFs??? Pictures definitely lose out in telling a story. See the attached GIF for example. With just one look, you can probably create an entire story in your head about the woman that is featured This can be very useful for future marketing prospects.

![Tell a Story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/6-unexpected-ways-gif-animation-maker-can-affect-your-marketing10.gif)

### 06**GIFs Can Be Used to Explain or Share Instructions**

In the same way that you can create long infographics to offer instructions or teach a lesson on a particular subject, GIFs can be used to educate your audience. Only, it's a lot easier to use for this reason No complicated infographics formatting is required You can just put together several stills showing the step-by-step process or record a silent video like the one shown in the GIF below
