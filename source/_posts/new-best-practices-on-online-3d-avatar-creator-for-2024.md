## Conclusion

If you're wondering why you should chose whiteboard animation over the conventional video creating technique, then you should probably try it out. Animation easily captures the interest of viewers and the slide-by-slide transitioning equally makes it better. You can always try out other software applications to know the one that fits you best.
