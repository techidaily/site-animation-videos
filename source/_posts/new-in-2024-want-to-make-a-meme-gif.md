## Part 1 What is the photo motion effect?

The photo motion effect online is ideal for creating an animation with your DSLR or still camera. It is just as it feels, the motion through photographs. Usually, with moving photo effects online, the camera is the one moving, along with its subjects. But, we aren't concerned with the camera usage here as we're just looking for the effect.

These are a little different than stop-motion, which generally has the fixed subjects are the only things moving bit by bit.

### 1\. Create a Plan

Consider shooting an event or location. Also, ensure there will be lots of movement and motion and movement if it's an event. Also, consider or brainstorm how you want the camera to move about the space if you’re shooting at a particular location. It could be you only hovering around with the camera, or you could strap it to a bike and take a ride.

### 2\. Click lots of Photos

Keep shooting lots of photos! Most cameras consist of a burst setting, where you can set it to click an image every few seconds. Or, you may tap the shutter button yourself.

### 3\. Import & Edit
