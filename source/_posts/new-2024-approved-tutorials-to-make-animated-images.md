You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.

Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.

Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is **animation rigging in Unity**. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.

The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.

Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as **unity rigging**. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.

## Part 2 Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?

Another platform that can ideally assist you in animation is Blender. A common question arises as to whether one should choose **blender rigging over Unity** or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.

| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |

| **Best Purpose**    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |

There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.

**●** Drawing

**●** Games

**●** In-Game Analytics

**●** Multi-player Gaming Network

**●** Player Management

**●** Virtual Reality

**●** IT Asset Management

**●** Prototype Creation

Therefore, it is preferred to opt for **Unity rigging** than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.

## Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity

Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in **unity rig animation**. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.

##### Step 1Installation

The first step is to install the "**animation rigging package" of Unity**. You will get the animation rigging package in the "Package Manager". You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.

This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called "runtime rigging".

The "Asset's Animator Root" consist of the "Rig Builder Component", which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create **Unity humanoid rig** that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.

![rig builder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-2.jpg)

##### Step 2Rig Builder set-up

After installing the **unity animation rigging package**, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the "Animator component" in this step. Using the "Animator component", integrate the "Rig Builder component" with the "GameObject". Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost "Transform".

Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the "Rig component". After this step, you need to access the "Animator root", where you will find the "Rig Builder component". In the "Rig Builder component", you need to assign the "Rig to the Rig Layers" list.

It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.

![rig builder set up unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-3.jpg)

##### Step 3Bone Rendering

Whether it is **unity rigging** or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The "Unity Editor" will help you interact and work with the character's skeleton in the "Scene view."

You can add "Transform" lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the "Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous "Bone Renderer" components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.

![bone rendering unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-4.jpg)

##### Step 4Adding Rig Effectors

This step enables one to add Gizmos to Transforms, facilitating selection and visualisation. The "Effector" are invisible during "Game View", and this step enhances the quality of the character animation.

![rig effects unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-5.jpg)

##### Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints

Your characters gain "runtime animation" through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.

![rig constraint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-6.jpg)

##### Step 6Working with the Two Bone IK Constraint

The first step here is to rest your character to the "Bind Pose." you can do so by opting for the "Menu Bar" and selecting the "Animation Rigging" option. You will find the "Bind Pose" option there, and you will have to click on it.

![bind pose unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-7.jpg)

Then add a child GameObject below "Character Rig". Then add a new child GameObject below "Right Arm IK". Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the "Right Arm Ik" by naming the first and the second one "RH IK Target" and "RH IK Hint", respectively.

![rh ik hint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-8.jpg)

Integrate the "Rig Builder Component" with the "Animator root GameObject". Then proceed with selecting the "CharecterRig GameObject" and integrating a "Rig Component". Select "Two Bone IK Contrainst" to the "Right Arm IK."

![rig component unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-9.jpg)

Then, incorporate a "Box Effector" to the RH IK Target. Integrate a "Ball Effector" to the "RH IK Hint".

![rh ik hint unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-10.jpg)

Then select the "RH IK Hint" and "Right Elbow". Select "Animation Rigging>align Transform". Move away from the "Ball Effector". Select the "Right Arm IK GameObject" and integrate the required bones. Integrate the Character Rig GameObkect with Rig Layer list by selecting the option of "Ninja". Then press "Play" and see your creation come to life.

## Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity

Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in **unity rig animation**. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.

##### Step 1Installation

The first step is to install the "**animation rigging package" of Unity**. You will get the animation rigging package in the "Package Manager". You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.

This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called "runtime rigging".

The "Asset's Animator Root" consist of the "Rig Builder Component", which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create **Unity humanoid rig** that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.

![rig builder unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-2.jpg)

##### Step 2Rig Builder set-up

After installing the **unity animation rigging package**, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the "Animator component" in this step. Using the "Animator component", integrate the "Rig Builder component" with the "GameObject". Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost "Transform".

Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the "Rig component". After this step, you need to access the "Animator root", where you will find the "Rig Builder component". In the "Rig Builder component", you need to assign the "Rig to the Rig Layers" list.

It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.

![rig builder set up unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-3.jpg)

##### Step 3Bone Rendering

Whether it is **unity rigging** or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The "Unity Editor" will help you interact and work with the character's skeleton in the "Scene view."

You can add "Transform" lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the "Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous "Bone Renderer" components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.

![bone rendering unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-4.jpg)

##### Step 4Adding Rig Effectors

This step enables one to add Gizmos to Transforms, facilitating selection and visualisation. The "Effector" are invisible during "Game View", and this step enhances the quality of the character animation.

![rig effects unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-5.jpg)

##### Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints

Your characters gain "runtime animation" through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.

![rig constraint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-6.jpg)

##### Step 6Working with the Two Bone IK Constraint

The first step here is to rest your character to the "Bind Pose." you can do so by opting for the "Menu Bar" and selecting the "Animation Rigging" option. You will find the "Bind Pose" option there, and you will have to click on it.

![bind pose unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-7.jpg)

Then add a child GameObject below "Character Rig". Then add a new child GameObject below "Right Arm IK". Integrate two new child GameObjects beneath the "Right Arm Ik" by naming the first and the second one "RH IK Target" and "RH IK Hint", respectively.

![rh ik hint unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-8.jpg)

Integrate the "Rig Builder Component" with the "Animator root GameObject". Then proceed with selecting the "CharecterRig GameObject" and integrating a "Rig Component". Select "Two Bone IK Contrainst" to the "Right Arm IK."

![rig component unity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-9.jpg)

Then, incorporate a "Box Effector" to the RH IK Target. Integrate a "Ball Effector" to the "RH IK Hint".

![rh ik hint unity 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-10.jpg)

Then select the "RH IK Hint" and "Right Elbow". Select "Animation Rigging>align Transform". Move away from the "Ball Effector". Select the "Right Arm IK GameObject" and integrate the required bones. Integrate the Character Rig GameObkect with Rig Layer list by selecting the option of "Ninja". Then press "Play" and see your creation come to life.

Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing **Unity character rigging** as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.

Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.

#### In this article

01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)

02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)

03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?

To understand what **Unity rigging** is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.

You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.

Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.

Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is **animation rigging in Unity**. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.

The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.

Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as **unity rigging**. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.

![what is unity rigging](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/learn-how-to-make-your-characters-interactive-in-unity-animation-rigging-1.jpg)

## Part 2 Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?

Another platform that can ideally assist you in animation is Blender. A common question arises as to whether one should choose **blender rigging over Unity** or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.

The **Adobe Auto rigger** is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of **Adobe 3D Rigging**.) It's a perfect tool for beginners.

Especially those that aren't really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.

#### In this article

01 [What's Adobe Auto Rigger?](#Part 1)

02 [How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?](#Part 2)

03 [Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What's Adobe Auto Rigger?**

Alright, so what is the **Adobe Auto Rigger** and how does it differ from **Adobe Animate Advanced Rigging** or **Adobe After Effects Rigging**? Is there any difference at all??? The simple answer? Yes, there is a definite difference.

It's all thanks to the third-party tool, **Mixamo**, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually **rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects**.) We'll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.

Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you're intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)

![Adobe Auto Rigger Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome1.png)

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

![Upload Custom Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome2.png)

### 02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters

The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters' tab (shown in the image below.)

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

![Browse for Auto-Rigged Characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome3.png)

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

![Adobe 3D Rigging with Mixamo Adobe Auto Rigger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome4.png)

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

It's all thanks to the third-party tool, **Mixamo**, which will allow you to upload characters for auto rigging (basically bypassing the kind of work that is usually required for manually **rigging and animating in Adobe Animate and After Effects**.) We'll talk more about this in the tutorial below. For now, all you need to know is that it takes care of setting up a character for you with only a few simple steps.

Thus, enabling you to quickly move forward in your projects if you wish. Whether you're intending to create a quick little animation for your website, or jumping into a video editing software like **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** (which is great professional software with everything you need to start creating high-quality content that you can share with your audience.)

## Part 2 **How Do You Auto Rig a Character in Adobe?**

Now onto our promised tutorial. Here, we make use of the **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, in order to demonstrate how you can bypass **Adobe Rigging** by making use of Mixamo's auto-rigging functions or their pre-existing character models for creating your projects.

### 01Upload Your Own Character

To start, you'll need to visit ‘Maximo.com' and sign in with your Adobe ID (email and password required.)

You can also sign-up for free if you'd like. That option is available for those who may want to explore the available options first.

Once you're logged in, go to the ‘Editor' panel and prepare to upload a custom character for automatic rigging. This is assuming that you have a character design already prepared, of course. If not, then don't worry. The next should help.

![Upload Custom Character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome2.png)

### 02(Optional) Browse for Downloadable Characters

The best part of Mixamo is that it has a rich library full of pre-rigged characters that you can use should you wish to. These can be found under the ‘Characters' tab (shown in the image below.)

So, if you don't have a character model prepared just yet or have no intention of diving too deeply into character design just in general, you don't have to worry. You can just download one of the pre-rigged characters here and use them for your project.

![Browse for Auto-Rigged Characters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome3.png)

### 03Rig a Custom Character

If you've decided to go forward with a custom character, after all, upload it to the **Adobe Auto Rigger** (shown in the image below.)

This is a very straightforward tool that you can use to place the most important markers on your figure (chin, wrists, elbows, knees, and groin). Once you've confirmed the placement of all these points, you can continue and come out of it with your Model auto-rigged and work-ready.

![Adobe 3D Rigging with Mixamo Adobe Auto Rigger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-auto-rigger-is-awesome4.png)

### 04Download Rigged Character and Begin Animation

It may take several minutes for the **Adobe Auto Rigger** to completely finish auto-rigging your project, so have a bit of patience. You'll be taken back to the main interface when complete, and you'll be able to download your now rigged model for use.

## Part 3 **Other AWESOME Auto Rigger Tools**

Now, just in case you're interested in other methods of automatically rigging outside of what we demonstrated above for **rigging in Adobe Animate** and After Effects… We've included some other add-ons and tools that you can use with other popular Animation software. They're all a little bit different, so make sure to pay attention to the details provided (and watch the video attached too. As it should show you just what exactly each of these auto-rigging tools is capable of doing for you.)

### 01InstantRig - Auto Rigger

The first Auto Rigger on this list is ‘Instant Rig.' This is a rigging tool for the Animation software called 3ds Max. More specifically, it's a ‘modular rigging' tool. That makes it very versatile, allowing you to determine the features of the character that you are working with based on their attributes (no matter how many fingers, toes, tails, ears, etc. they need.) The tool is particularly popular with game developers, as it is a quick and easy way of rigging game characters — whether they be humanoid or beastly in form. (A free version of the tool is available, but a full license will require a one-time fee of around $35.)

### 02Auto-Rig Pro

Next, we have the auto-rigging addon for the free, open-source Animation Software, Blender. This add-on can be used very similarly to the **Adobe Animate Puppet Rig** tools — and is free to use besides. The add-on has a ‘smart feature' that is capable of automatically rigging up joints and bones of humanoid forms in an instant and can also be used for rigging up non-humanoid characters — albeit, it would have to be manual.

### 03Perseus Auto Rig - Maya

Next up, we have Perseus Auto Rig. This one works with Maya (which is a very popular professional software used by a lot of animation studios in the industry) and actually comes in three versions. There's the Perseus ‘Biped Rigging' license for humanoid characters, the Perseus ‘Facial Rigging' license for rigging facial features, and the Perseus ‘Quadruped Rigging' license for non-humanoid creatures.

### 04Auto Character Setup

Next is the auto-character set-up tool for MODO. This is a tool designed for rigging up bi-pedal characters — so mostly humanoid forms. But it does offer some flexibility as to the form that bipedal character takes. So, you can adjust it as needed if there's something incongruous with your design and the auto-rigger itself.

### 05IKMAX

For our last tool for auto-rigging, we have IKMAX. This works for 3ds Max and Maya (both of which we've mentioned before. It's very easy to use and adjust as needed — with sliders that you can fiddle around with the work through any problem areas if need be.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** If you're interested in introducing animations into your content but you don't have the time or the patience to get too involved with **Adobe Rigging** (which is a complex subject to talk about even for some professional animators), the auto-rigging solutions are definitely something to consider.

**●** The **Adobe Auto Rigger**, Mixamo, is an especially exciting tool to try out. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it comes with pre-made character designs that you can play around with to start your experimentations into animation early.

**●** If Adobe is not your software of choice, don't worry. There are other auto-rigging tools that you can try out if need be. We introduced at least five that you can use with some of the more popular alternative animation software in a list for you to look through.

The **Adobe Auto rigger** is definitely something to look into if you want to quickly and easily prep 3D Animated Characters (without having to learn all the difficult ins and outs of **Adobe 3D Rigging**.) It's a perfect tool for beginners.

Especially those that aren't really looking to create big animated projects, just small animated characters or objects that they can use for their websites, video content, video game development, etc.

It all started in the 1960s in Japan and until now anime has only changed people’s lives and their thinking with the pseudo content. People these days especially teenagers and university students are watching a lot of anime shows online because they have found it much better than the real world where the anime series online would encourage them to be good friends, socially active, and intelligent.

Recently one of my friends asks me if I could recommend some anime series to her. Then I wrote this article to show the **best 10 anime series of all time**. And I also list some new anime series in 2020.

![animate cc camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-camera.JPG)

#### 2\. Export format

This tweak has revolutionized the web based flash animation by simply eliminating the annoying “need to install a flash player plug-in” which was in case of Flash Professional Platform. With Adobe Animate, users can export content for WebGL, HTML5 Canvas, 4k video easily.

Moreover, you can generate the keyframes based sprite-sheet and animate them accordingly using the CSS. Adapting web standards doesn’t mean that Adobe Animate CC has entirely abandoned the SWF format.

Users do have a privilege to export their files to Flash Player format. Furthermore, a new OAM packaging is also introduced by new Adobe Animate CC which enables you to package assets in .zip format.

![animate cc export format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animate-cc-export-format.JPG)

#### 3\. Vector brushes

Another important functionality that Adobe Animate has brought is giving the opportunity to create vector brushes. This is kind of same as that used in Adobe Illustrator. With this update in brushing tools, one can have pressure and tilt functionalities on drawing of lines and strokes with the help of pen or stylus.

This is helpful in creating strokes in touch-sensitive devices. The width can be changed according to how much pressure you apply when creating patterns. So, if you wish to create 2D vector graphics using shapes, patterns, curves etc. Animate CC would be a good choice.

#### 5\. Font

Adobe Animate CC comes now with integration of Typekit where you get countless premium web fonts. These web fonts will be present for HTML5 canvas documents in the tool. Users can pick out from thousands of high-quality fonts via a subscription plan.

Putting in different words, first you can try some selected fonts available in the Typekit library via any level of Creative Cloud plan. Then when you subscribe by spending some money, you can then get access to complete Typekit library where there are thousands of premium fonts for HTML5 canvas.

Read this article on how to draw the perfect cartoon character yourself:

Step 1: The first is to have an idea of what you want to draw, i.e., the picture you want to draw. You can pick any character to draw from your favorite website or WeeWorld.com.

**●** First, you draw the face but make sure you don't add a nose but do a black outline.

**●** Next, you can draw the other features but make sure you don't use colored pencils. Only use your main writing utensil.

**●** Then, remember to use your imagination to add the clothes and hairstyle.

**●** Finally, you can delete any unwanted lines and color with artist utensils, such as crayons, paintbrushes, colored pencils, etc. Also, remember that you can add some detail to your character to make it pop out and be beautiful.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-8.png)

**Step 2:** Now you have officially made your cartoon, how does it feel?

![how to draw your own cartoon character 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-9.png)

**Step 3:** Next, you want to go back and draw again, but this time, not an imitation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 03](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-10.png)

**Step 4:** Pick up a new piece of paper to be used to draw another character. But this time, you need to change the features. You can decide to make the eyes bigger, neon skin, and maybe crazy hair. You can try clothes that you would love to wear, or ones you wish you could get. Also, try to change the size around to make the features look different and add a nose, and then you can finally color your creation.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 04](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-11.png)

**Step 5:** Now, you can compare the two drawings to notice the difference. You will realize that one is an imitation while the other is all you! Now, you can grab a new piece of notebook paper.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 05](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-12.png)

**Step 6:** Next is that you begin to jot down different ideas. For example, you may want to draw a cute little puppy or a cute baby. Sometimes you can decide that your cartoon could be about a talking apple or something different.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-13.png)

**Step 7:** Grab another piece of paper and draw any other character you can imagine. You can try using a Sharpie marker for the outline by carefully tracing the pencil. Then you can erase any stray marks on the piece of paper. Next, you can also use any writing utensils like markers, crayons, colored pencils, pastels, or even paint, as it also works well.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 07](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-14.png)

**Step 8:** You can grab your notebook sheet again and then jot down any idea of a comic series. Also, make a plot or funny lines that you could use or any other characters.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 08](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-15.png)

**Step 9:** Next, you fold the blank sheet of paper and make it into about four lines. And then you can draw your main character by just using a pencil first.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 09](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-16.png)

**Step 10:** You can then draw the other characters and all the basic outlines in the drawing.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-17.png)

**Step 11:** Next is that you can draw the furniture and background, such as trees or anything else, to beautify your drawing.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-18.png)

**Step 12:** You can go back and add details and outline with Sharpie or black marker and delete any stray marks. You can also color if wanted.

![how to draw your own cartoon character 12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-do-funny-cartoon-drawings-19.png)

**Step 13:** Next is for you to add dialogue and actively work with your character drawing.
