If this is the case, then you benefit from saving time and the expertise of a professional design team through Canva.

The second option is creating an animation by yourself. Creating your own animation offers you greater flexibility in executing your vision for the design. Without further ado, let’s look at how we can help this happen in the how to make a moving graphic in the Canva section.

## Part 2 Make A Moving Graphic In Canva

Making a moving graphic in Canva is easy. Canva offers an “Animation” button that allows users to animate each element in the content. There are four areas that the graphic can touch upon for content. These areas are text, image, audio, and video.

Here’s how you can animate individual elements in Canva.

### 2.1 How to animate text in Canva?

With text, Canva offers three options. You can choose to create either a title text, a sub-heading text, or regular text for use. Play with different styles and fonts to find one that suits your design. You can also add details like stickers or illustrations to customize the design.

You are now ready to animate once you’re happy with the design. Text animations will help your text jump out from the background. Then choose the "Animate" option in the sidebar after clicking on the selected text.

Allow your font to move around your design with motion. Thanks to "animate," you can choose between subtle, smooth movement and jagged and sudden motion. You can even mix and match animations for each word.

In Wondershare Filmora, a premier video editing software, the texts are available according to use. For instance, opening and ending credit texts as a template. With options for choosing subtitles, lower 3rds, and call-out templates.

Additionally, users can also save a particular setting as a “preset’. Which makes it easy to reuse the settings in future projects. You can also adjust the duration of the individual text display. It also has an animation option that allows animation of the text according to given presets.

### 2.2 How do you animate a picture in Canva?

Users have the ability to choose to animate just the image or animate other elements of the picture. They can also make use of options to edit the image using background remover. This allows seamless integration into the presentation.

### 2.3 How do you add music to animation in Canva?

Users can find a section dedicated to “Uploads,” allowing creators to use their audio content. The users can use a soundtrack from one of Canva’s audio libraries. This gives users control over their animation’s impact.

Users can also make use of the Audio Effects feature to create audio for “Echo,” “large room,” “small room,” “lobby,” and “phone.” The preview function can help users experience it live before applying the effect.

Filmora Pro’s Auto-Normalization of audio allows intelligent audio analysis and volume adjustment.

Filmora offers all the essential video editing tools in addition to AI-powered features called Auto-Highlight and Auro-Reframe. Auto Highlight is a feature that extracts the highlights from a video clip autonomously.

This will save you time while cutting your movie. It also makes it easier to extract the best moments from the video.

Auto Reframe recognizes as well as crops the focal point of your footage, constantly retaining it in the frame. Your film’s primary action or object will never be out of focus within that technique.
