We will discuss animated characters to draw in hand. There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.

### 01 Smurfette

Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.

So, in general, it's best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.

### 01Angelica Pickles

Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.

### 03Yogi Bear

Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.

### 04Magilla Gorilla

Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera's Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.

### 05Top Cat

Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat. He's wearing a cap and a button-down vest, and he's making some reasonably fancy dances. Give Top Cat a shot if you like The Flintstones' basic Hanna-Barbera art style.

### 06Helga. G. Pataki

Helga is another character with some wacky hair. There's a lot that's bizarre about her. And half the fun of drawing her is figuring out how to do it. Just keep an eye on her head since getting it correct, especially with her rectangle hairdo, can be a little odd.

These are some of the **cool animated characters to draw.**

## Part 3 **4 Best Drawing Exercise for Creating Cartoon Characters**

You'll learn how to create cartoon characters individually, including their faces, hair, and facial expressions.

### 01How to Draw Cartoon Characters

We'll go through the fundamentals of human perception before getting into cartoon face drawing. Humans have a unique ability to synthesize the details that make up a structure or object in highly complicated ways into fundamental and simple ones. We can express everything with a few curves and geometric forms in this way. In cartoon face, we need to identify the character just by looking like looking at the below picture a girl and a boy.

![Boy and Girl](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ultimate-guide-to-animated-characters-drawings-07.jpg)

### 02Here, you will learn How to Draw a Cartoon Face

Let us begin with a sketch of a cartoon face. A circle is a basic cartoon shape. All you need is a circle. As seen in the image below, draw a vertical and horizontal line intersecting at the center.

Let us have a look at how to make cartoon eyeballs. Draw an oval shape with a slight lean to the side at the top for the eyes. Repeat on the other side.

Slightly thicken the characteristic to represent our character eyelashes at the top of the circle, place the brows above the eyelashes to create a shocking appearance, draw both pupils to the center in the same direction.

![Face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ultimate-guide-to-animated-characters-drawings-08.jpg)

When creating a nose from the front, it's typical to leave off many details. Even if you merely sketch its tip, it will likely provide a convincing impact. Drawing only one side of the nose is also quite frequent. Children's mouths are extremely simple in cartoon style, regardless of gender.

The ears are viewed from the front; therefore, the internal holes are not visible. The circle has already established the shape of our head.

![Nose and Ear](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ultimate-guide-to-animated-characters-drawings-09.jpg)

### 03Let's learn about How to Draw a Cartoon Hair

Keep in mind that our characters' hair is essential for identifying their personalities, and it can also indicate their age. So, all we need is an effortless and playful haircut to bring our boy to life. Because there is no particular method for drawing hair, you'll have to experiment until you find the perfect look. Look for photo references on the internet! Take a look at a magazine shoot or a Google search.

![Hair](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/ultimate-guide-to-animated-characters-drawings-10.jpg)

### 03How to Draw Characters with different Facial Expressions

By simply following the instructions below, you'll notice that you can completely transform his expression: Lowering one brow and raising the other, eyelashes are used to cut the eyes in half, putting a smile on the face one side is higher.

To stay under the eyelashes, move the eye pupils up. That's all there is to it! With just a few tweaks, we achieved the desired result. The circular form of the eyes, hair, ears, nose, chin and the circular shape of the ears are all the same! It's that simple!

We've outline a thorough explanation on the subject so that you can be prepared as you can be, so continue reading in order to learn more.

03 [5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects](#Part 3)

04 [Adobe Alternative to Make Text Animation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What's Text Animation?

![Text Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know1.png)

"**Text Animation**" refers to moving letters, words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. The animation, or movement, rather, can be anything. It can move from side to side, jump up and down, create a dizzying circle, recede from view, etc. Usually, said movement is placed on an endless repeat, a pattern that the text is coded to follow decided by the animator who created it!

## Part 2 **What Adobe Program is Best for Text Animation?**

![Adobe Animation Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know2.png)

Adobe Animate is Adobe's very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

![After Effects: Animators](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know4.png)

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

![Per Character 3D Text Properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know5.png)

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

![Path Animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know6.png)

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.

![Adobe Animation Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know2.png)

Adobe Animate is Adobe's very own software developed for animators. Whether they be working on movies, shows, short videos for online posting, games, or text animations. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, this is the software most professionals use in order to bring life to their digital creations. It's also the one that we'd recommend if you're looking into advanced **adobe animate text animation**!

## Part 3 **5 Creative Ways to Animate Text in After Effects**

Now, we should make it very clear, of course. That while Adobe Animate is considered the best for animation (whether it be text or character models), there are other tools that you can use in order to get the same effect. For example, there's **adobe spark animate text**, **adobe premiere pro animate text**, and this next one, also from Adobe, called After Effects, is a VFX and motion graphics software used to create movie titles, intros, transitions, logos, and so much more.

We've listed some of the more creative ways you can use After Effects to create what could very well be **Adobe Animate text effects** below to help you along:

### 01METHOD 1: After Effects Animation Presets

The first, and easiest, way of animating your text with After Effects is to use presets! After Effects offers multiple animations presets that you can try in order to test out certain settings. (This is also a good way of getting to know the possibilities and limits of text animation and how you can work within those bounds.

![Text Effects & Presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Image%20Title%20adobe-animate-text-effects-skills-that-you-need-to-know3.png)

### 02METHOD 2: After Effects Text Animators

If the presets aren't working out for you, you can also try out After Effect's "animators" and "selectors". To clarify, you add 'animators' to your text (it will mark the object(s) to be animated). And then, you use a 'selector' in order to specify how you want the properties to be animated. This is a great way of truly getting the exact effect that you want, although it might take some finagling to get it to work completely.

### 03METHOD 3: Per-Character 3D Text Properties

If you want to step up your game even more, you can always make your texts into 3D characters on their own! This is easier to do in Adobe Dimension, which (from the example image below) you can see has a "Text" preset that you can use in order to start creating 3D Text Properties immediately! The beauty of this method, of course, is that your text can be adjusted like any 3D character. Making the possibilities endless!

### 04METHOD 4: Path Animation

The next method of animating with After Effects is a little more constrained than the others we've introduced thus far. However, it has its uses! As you can see from the image below, you can animate your text to follow a mask (which you set over your text layer). This will make it possible for you to animate along a path.

### 05METHOD 5: After Effects Selectors

This next method is related to the 'Animators' methods we introduced second. It also works a lot like the masks we mentioned in Method 4--which, as mentioned, you can use in order to set up a foundation or limits for your animation.
