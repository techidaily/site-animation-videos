## Part 1 Create Good Morning/Night GIF Images with Adobe Photoshop

If you are familiar with Adobe Photoshop or are willing to learn it, you can also use its assistance to create good morning/night GIF images. Even though the application is mostly used to edit images, it can also help you develop all kinds of funny good morning/night GIFs.

To do that, you need to work on different layers in Photoshop and then merge them as a single frame to provide a more animated appeal. Here are some basic steps that you can follow to come up with anime good night or morning GIFs.

##### Step 1 Launch Photoshop and Load Media Assets

You can start by launching Adobe Photoshop on your system and visiting its File > Scripts section to load your media files.

![adobe photoshop load media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-2.jpg)

##### Step 2 Start working on Animated GIFs in Photoshop

Now, to come up with a funny good morning/night GIF, you can go to its Menu > Layer and choose to create a new layer.

![photoshop add layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-3.jpg)

Since it is recommended to have a timeline for your media, you can go to its Window > Timeline to get a timeline view at the bottom.

![photoshop timeline view](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-4.jpg)

Afterward, you can go to the timeline at the bottom panel and choose work on frame animations to create any good morning/night animation.

![photoshop make frame from layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-6.jpg)

##### Step 3 Make Final Adjustments to your Animated GIFs

As you would have different good morning/night GIF funny animations, you can right-click on the timeline and set up their respective durations.

![photoshop set duration for frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-7.jpg)

![repeat frames on photosho](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/good-morning-night-gifs-8.jpg)

## Part 2 4 Awesome Ways to Use Logo Animation

### 01They can serve as introductions to marketing videos

Video marketing is one of the most commonly used marketing techniques. Research suggested that about 99 percent of brands use video marketing in order to enhance their brand image. Starting of your video with an animated logo will not just look catchy but also make the video all the more professional.

### 02They can make great outros

Just like animated videos can serve as amazing introductory bits of the video, they can also be the perfect outros to videos. If you haven’t added your animated logo in the introduction of the video then they can be added at the end. This will lead to your viewers remembering your brand for a longer time.

### 03Look very attractive at trade shows

Trade shows are opportunities where websites and company owners can interact with investors and potential customers face to face. It’s an excellent opportunity to make your mark on the big stage. Logos of companies may be projected on the big screen in such events. At such events when you have just a few seconds to make a mark, you need your logo to grab the viewer's attention. Hence, animated logos could be very useful.

### 04They could be a great addition to your company’s email signature

Emails are regarded as the 3rd largest information sources in the B2B industry. It is one of the largest means of communication and marketing. Email signatures have been around for years; however the traditional email signatures have now gone out of fashion. Contemporary email signatures include animated logos to leave a bigger impact on the receiver. Using animated logos, you can add grace to your email signatures and escape the ordinary.

## Part 3 6 of the Best Animated Logos

### 01Mastercard

Mastercard is one of the first companies to use animated logos. The logo is simply fantastic due to the meaning it conveys without any complex animation. The animated logo involves the traditional venn diagram logo of mastercard morphing into several objects. These objects include everything from food to groceries to luxurious products. It basically includes the various kinds of commodities people buy using mastercards.

### 02Burger king

Another popular brand that uses animated logos is the american fast food giant, burger king. The logo is not highly flashy like we see in mastercard. However, the animated logo does obviously look more attention seeking than the conventional static logo. The logo shows the stacking of the different elements of the logo one by one over each other. This resembles the process of making a burger.

### 03Fedex

Another logo that would classify as a flashy animated logo is the fedex logo. Initially, fedex had experimented with several logos before sticking to the arrow logo which continues even today. The animated logo involves an arrow making the letter “Fedex” with its trajectory and then finally settling in between letters X and E. The logistics giant delivers couriers from one corner of the world to another, and the arrow symbolizes exactly that!

### 04Flickr

Flickr is a popular stock image and video hosting platform. Anyone can use the stock images and videos in their content. The logo starts with a blue and pink dot initially. These dots later expand in a whirlpool like motion. The logo starts off with the static logo before it expands. The idea is to show that the online stock image portal goes beyond limits and has every picture and video you’d need

### 05Bundle

Bundle is a popular app that offers its users rewards upon shopping from selected stores. These stores have an alliance with bundle and upon shopping from them, users seek reward points on the bundle app. The animated logo starts of with a pink screen which later converges to become a large “B” wrapped with a gifting ribbon. Although, the logo is pretty simple it does an amazing job at explaining the brand’s MSP and attracts customers.

### 06Google

The logo of google has evolved over the years. Google is almost synonymous to attractive logos and it comes up with attractive new logos every now and then. One of the newest logos, an animated one, is by far one of the most attractive animated logos. It aims to depict the numerous things users can search using “Google voice search”.
