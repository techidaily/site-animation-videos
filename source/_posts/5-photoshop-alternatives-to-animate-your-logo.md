These animation tips will help you make your 2D and 3D animations as bold and creative as possible, while reduce your workload and enable you to get your work out into the world quicker with [excellent animation software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

![2d animaiton reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reference.JPG)

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

![animation tips simplicity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simplicity.JPG)

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

![2D draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/draw-animation.jpg)

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

![feedback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feedback.JPG)

## Part 2: 3D Animation Tips for Beginners

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

![focus your frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-your-frame.JPG)

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

![ criticism](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/criticism.JPG)

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

![3D animation tips model](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/model.JPG)

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

You can learn animation on your own, but that's not the best way. We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Conclusion

By taking the above animation tips, you can create engaging, inspiring, and unforgettable animations that will captivate your audience. Why not get started following these animation tips right now?

Speaking of 3D animation, we think it is not easy to start at first. In this case, you need more tips and tricks.

### 6\. Carefully use keyframing

3D Animation is all about poses. Remember, this animation tip is crucial. Individual frames come together to create movement and tell a story. [The keyframes in 3D animation videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are the first and last movements in any sequence. You need to create strong first and last poses for your movements before deciding what happens between them. You must make these poses as memorable and powerful as you can.

### 7\. Evaluate constructive criticism

It’s vital to pay attention to [constructive criticism](https://www.themuse.com/advice/taking-constructive-criticism-like-a-champ) rather than simply choosing to ignore it. Most examples of constructive criticism aren’t about offending you, and friendly advice can play a pivotal role in helping you get the results that you are looking for.

This 3D animation tip can take years to reach the level you want to when it comes to the animation industry. Even if you don’t receive a great deal of or even any positive feedback, the people offering their comments may simply be trying to help you so you can improve. You may find that the criticism is being made purely because of personal preference on the part of the commentator.

### 8\. Take the rhythm in animation

For 3D stop motion animation video, rhythm is an element to do storytelling. The best 3D animations have a strong sense of rhythm and a natural movement flow. Many inexperienced animators have found themselves animating too fast or slow. Don’t worry if you have this problem in the early days, as chances are you’ll start to get it right with time. Timing and spacing between your frames create movement in your animation. With time, you will get a better idea of how many frames you need to move the object from point A to B.

![tips for rhythm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rhythm.JPG)

### 9\. Basic model

You may see your system working too hard when you use a [high-res model](https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/motion-graphics/8-best-websites-for-3d-models/), and this can dramatically slow down the animation process. When you playback the animation in real-time, you may not see every frame. If you are working on the motion of a character, use a simple proxy 3D model to prevent this problem. You can then work more effectively with movement and return the more complex model to the process later.

### 10\. Use ‘shark fin’

This is a advanced 3D animation tip for you. A curve known as the ‘shark fin’ is often used for facial animation processes. This can help you represent rapid facial movements, including those involving the lips and eyebrows. Faces can move very quickly, so it’s wise to make expressions occur within just one or two frames, or three if the spacing demands it.

![shark fin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shark-fin.JPG)

## Part 3: Frequently Asked Questions about Animation Tips

Below are four FAQs about 2D and 3D animation tips that people have asked many times. Hope they are helpful.

### 1\. Are there any animation tricks to use?

We must say muting dialogue is one trick you should know. If your audio is on, you need to listen to it again and again. Thus, audio can disturb your creating process. After you finished the animation, you can turn audio on to revise the animation.

Besides, when you do animation, another trick is you can pause the post before the character goes into the next pose. It is a commonly used trick used by professionals, so you might think it is useful.

### 2\. Is animation hard to learn?

Many beginners are wondering is it difficult to learn animation. The answer is NO if you are about to learn 2D animation. Many tutorials and lessons are easy to find in the market. However, if you start on 3D animation, it will be much harder than you thought. In this case, we recommend you learning 2D animation first.

### 3\. Can I learn animation on my own?

You can learn animation on your own, but that's not the best way. We recommend you learning animation by attending a [training class](https://www.skillshare.com/browse/animation), especially if you are a starter. You can build a solid animation knowledge base fast compared with learning on your own.

### 4\. How can I get better at animation?

The best answer to get better is to imitate and practice. This tip is the most useful, practical, but difficult to complete one. If you can practice like half a year, you will get much better at animation.

## Conclusion

By taking the above animation tips, you can create engaging, inspiring, and unforgettable animations that will captivate your audience. Why not get started following these animation tips right now?

## Part 1: 2D Animation Tips for Beginners

### 1\. Find a reference in the real world

This first 2D animation tip is to find a reference. Using a real-world reference can help you animate faces effectively. When studios work with [voice-over artists](https://www.dailynews.com/2018/11/27/heres-what-it-takes-to-be-a-voiceover-actor-in-la-courtesy-of-working-pros/), they often record their facial movements so 2D animators can work with them and ensure their expressions are captured convincingly.

If this isn’t possible, consider using your face, so you have something to refer back to. You could use a mirror and speak the words your character will be saying into it. This can help you get the animated expressions just right.

![2d animaiton reference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reference.JPG)

### 2\. Observe real life

The second animation tip is about observation. One of the key aspects of 2D animation is bringing life to animate objections. You need to think hard about [how emotion can be portrayed](https://the-artifice.com/animated-works-emotions/) and choose each movement carefully.

Spend time watching how people in real-life environments talk and interact with each one another, how they move, and how they express emotion. People-watching can be worth its weight in gold when it comes to preparing animations for 2D. Don’t be afraid to spend a great deal of time doing this, as it can be counted as valuable research.

![observe real life](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/observe-real-life.JPG)

### 3\. Simplicity is the key

2D animation is never complicated compared with 3D. Think carefully before making a scene too complex. If there is too much information to digest, the overall effect can be one of confusion, and you may even find yourself compromising the realism of the scene. Try not to litter the scene with too many pose changes or other elements, and keep it authentic.

![animation tips simplicity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simplicity.JPG)

### 4\. Draw animation again and again

Drawing animation takes a lot of time. It can't be finished within one day, so you better know deep down that one piece of work only can be done after you have revised it many times. For 2D animation, it means you need to draw objects on paper many times.

In other words, the animation is a skill that needs practice and time. You can't master it quickly. Luckily, all pains will be rewarded someday.

![2D draw animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/draw-animation.jpg)

### 5\. Feedback is crucial

Feedback is an essential part of [artistic development](https://thevirtualinstructor.com/blog/the-stages-of-artistic-development). It’s wise to actively seek out commentary from knowledgeable figures who can help you improve. Naturally, we may see work we have invested a great deal of time and effort indifferently to someone not so involved in the creative process. Feedback can equate to a valuable learning opportunity that will help you make the result hit the spot much more convincingly.

Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.

It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.

## Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva

There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.

The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.

Think of the text font you’re going to use.

![Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png)

Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.

![Animated elements Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png)

You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.

![Adding pictures to Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png)

Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.

### 2.1 Image

To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.

For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don't. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.

The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.

![Canva page animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png)

The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.

### 2.2 Text

Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.

![Canva text animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-5.png)

### 2.3 Video

If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.

Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.

With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.

On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.

![Canva playback animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-6.png)

If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.

You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”

## Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva

### How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?

The brilliant thing about Canva is that you can decide the order you want to create your animation. The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.

You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.

### How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva

Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.

If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.

## Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video

If you’ve decided Canva is not the tool for you, you can choose any video editing software to make your animation.

Wondershare Filmora is the tool that can help you level up your content creation. It allows users to increase precision and provides professional video editing options.

**AI Portrait – The best feature of Wondershare Filmora for gameplay editing**

The AI Portrait is a new add-on in Wondershare Filmora. It can easily remove video backgrounds without using a green screen or chroma key, allowing you to add borders, glitch effects, pixelated, noise, or segmentation video effects.

![ai portrait wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-multiple-ai-portrait-add-on.jpg)

### Conclusion

There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.

The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.

Think of the text font you’re going to use.

![Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png)

Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.

![Animated elements Canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png)

You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.

![Adding pictures to Canva image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png)

Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.

### 2.1 Image

To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.

For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don't. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.

The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.

![Canva page animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png)

The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.

### 2.2 Text

Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.

![Canva text animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-5.png)

### 2.3 Video

If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.

Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.

With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.

On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.

![Canva playback animations](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-6.png)

If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.

You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”

## Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva

### How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?

The brilliant thing about Canva is that you can decide the order you want to create your animation. The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.

You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.

### How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva

Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.

If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.

## Part 4 How About Making Animated Elements On Video

If you’ve decided Canva is not the tool for you, you can choose any video editing software to make your animation.

Wondershare Filmora is the tool that can help you level up your content creation. It allows users to increase precision and provides professional video editing options.

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

![erase and shade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-16.jpg)

## Part 2 **How to Draw Cartoon Step by Step Easy Pencil Drawing**

An essential factor you must bear in mind is that you must not let go of your creativity when learning how to draw.

You have to be free with yourself and try to create **cartoon sketch drawings** of characters that you love.

The more it's about something you love, the better you get at it.

Here's a step-by-step process of an easy pencil drawing or **sketch cartoon drawing.**

**●** **Step 1: Draw a circle**

Draw a circle and a "noodle" shape, as shown in the illustration. The head is a circle, and the body is a pear form.

The lower half of the pear is fatter than the top. Take note of how the upper half slightly overlaps the head circle.

![draw a circle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-09.jpg)

**●** **Step 2: Draw a pair of eyes.**

As shown in the image, add the perspective guidelines around the head. These recommendations will assist you in correctly positioning your rabbit's eyes and nose.

Above the horizontal guideline, draw the eyes. Where the parameters cross is where the nose is put.

![draw the eyes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-10.jpg)

**●** **Step 3: Draw the cheek and Wings**

Make the cheekbones. As shown in the illustration, add the ears and arms. It's OK if the ear shapes differ somewhat from those displayed.

Notice how the arm contour curve organically emerges from behind the shoulders when you sketch the arms. Make it this way if you can.

![draw the cheeks and wings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-11.jpg)

**●** **Step 4: Draw the legs**

Draw the legs and tail of the animal. The arm and leg curves may appear to be challenging. As a result, be gentle with your pencil. Don't yank on the pencil too hard!

Your cartoon rabbit's shape is now plainly evident.

![draw the legs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-12.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Draw the mouth**

Let's focus on the face for a moment. Draw an iris ellipse and an inner line in the ear inside the eyes. Include the nose. Draw the mouth and the teeth.

![draw the mouth](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-13.jpg)

**●** **Step 6: Outline the contours**

Because rabbits eat carrots, this one eats them in excess. Outline the carrot's outlines. On the legs, draw the brows and the fingers.

As you may have observed, I messed up the teeth in the previous image. Therefore I deleted the thick black pencil lines that were superfluous.

Erase and Shade (Step 8)

![outline the contours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-14.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Outline the Character**

Now, outline the contours of the entire character with a softer pencil. You can pick up B4 or B6 (if you don't have either, try HB). Please leave a little bright dot on the nose while darkening it.

![outline the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-cartoon-sketch-drawing-15.jpg)

**●** **Step 8: Erase and Shade**

Remove everything that isn't required. See? That is how your bunny should seem.

I also advocate using a pencil-type eraser in addition to regular or kneaded erasers. Shade the entire rabbit's body if you're using a graphite pencil. The inside of the ear, the belly, the paws, and the tail can all be white or brighter.

### 01Hassle Free Video Streaming

A seamless stream is something all of us would wish to be guaranteed of, before even thinking to watch a video. Whether looking through informative content or just as an entertainment choice, videos with frequent buffering intervals are always disapproving. One of the major reasons you should prefer an online video download is to escape the 'and…that's buffering again' notch.

### 02Information Sharing

Living within a bunch of social media platforms and utilities, content sharing has become more of a habit than a requisite need. Any and everything ranging from useful to entertaining, unusual to funny; is shared across social media platforms every seconds.

Well, that's absolutely fine, but what if you wish to share large video files through Instant Messaging tools and mails? Link sharing is not always convenient, owing to device version differences. To be on the safe side, it is quite better to download videos online and share them with your peers without having to worry about length and device compatibility.

### 03Cut Down on e-Learning Utilities

Besides this, installation procedures may often be wary and time consuming. Taking the help of inbuilt download feature these online tools have is an affordable pick through.

### 06Convenient Usage

Not everyone around you is familiar with the know-how of technical utilities. Keeping that in mind, these online video download tools are developed to serve users within a range of technical backgrounds. Even if you don't know anything about downloads, all you need to do is just copy a video link and paste it in the downloader's URL bar and that's actually it.
