If you have made a collage before on photoshop, you can use the old **collage photoshop template**. Otherwise, you need to create a new document for the collage.

**●** **Step 4: Add the selected images one-by-one**

Adding the images can be done in many ways. One way to do so is by opening the photo and clicking on it. Another way of doing so is to use the "Marquee Tool" of Photoshop.

![marquee tool photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-5.jpg)

**●** **Step 5: Arrange the images**

Now, arrange the images in the way you want. If you have chosen to tell a story through your **collage creator in photoshop**, then arrange the photos accordingly. You can do so with the help of the "Move" tool or simply tap V. You can also use the "Free Transform" tool to edit and transform the images in the way you want. You can resize, rotate and edit the photos in many other ways through the "Free Transform" tool.

**Step 6: Integrate image space**

To **create a collage in photoshop** in a better and more spaced-out manner, you need to add some spacing between the images you have in your collage. There are two ways to add spacing between the pictures; one way is by creating a thin, white border around each image.

And the second method is by accessing and using the "Layers" feature in Photoshop.

![add layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-8.jpg)

**●** **Step 7: Merge all the Layers**

This step is necessary when you have used the "Layer" feature to create the spacing among the images present in your collage. You will be able to do so from the "Layer" option. So, go to the "Layer" option and select the "Merge Invisible" option present there.

![merge layer photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-make-a-photoshop-collage-in-easy-steps-9.jpg)

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

## Part 4 3 Tips for Making Great Animations for 2D Games

Now that you have some initial idea of **2D game animation** let's jump to the top 3 tips that will help you create the best and unique **2D game character animation** designs with ease.

It will be beneficial while knowing **how to make 2D animation for games**.

### 01Focus on the story and start with simple movements

You need to focus on the storyline so that outcome will come accordingly. Focus on every detail while sketching, and don't miss out on simple movements. Take paper and pencil and start drawing simple exercises like the movement of a bouncing ball etc.

### 02Use keyframes properly

You need to carefully use keyframes' start and endpoints to have robust storytelling and movements. To adequately describe the first and last, you need to consider effectively using the keyframes.

### 03Enliven your characters

You need to give life to your characters so that audience can best relate to the story. Also, pay good attention to facial expressions, sound, tickling movements, etc.

Although these may look like the most straightforward tips ever, these are the most practical **2D** **game animation** strategies that can do wonders if used effectively.

## Part 5 How to Make 2D Animation for Games

Making 2D game character animation isn't a straightforward process and thus needs detailed knowledge that we will describe below.

Let's use Unity as the **best 2D animation software for** **games** without further ado!

Essential awareness of the Unity Editor (how to navigate and open tabs) is required to work with the Unity Animation window.

### 01Step 1: Start the Animation tab

Choose the Adventurer character and launch the Animation tab.

![select animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-16.jpg)

Dock this next to your project tab and console tab. Head towards the project tab and name with the Adventurer folder. Make a new folder known as "Animation."

With the Animation tab, create a new animation known as "Idle" placed in our Animation folder.

It also creates an Animator Controller in that same folder.

![idle animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-17.jpg)

Now, let's start animating this character!

### 02Step 2: Proceed with the Idle Animation

IKs contribute a lot to the efficiency and speed of animating when it comes to idle animation. We must animate a subtle movement very similar to a breathing motion. Tap the red record button and move the character to this position:

![a select idle animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-18.jpg)

Now go about fifty frames ahead and barely move the top torso bone straight down.

Drag the arm IKs to the side to contain less bend in them and display a sort of "swinging" motion. Here is the pose that I chose:

![2d game character pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-19.jpg)

A subtle tweak is there. It makes the idle animation look strange if we create large movements. Then, choose the first group of keyframes and tap the Ctrl-C (Command-C on a Mac).

Then, paste these frame-centric keyframes on number 1:50.

So, the nice looping animation is over now! It looks genuine, but we need to add some head motion to improve the illusion.

Just rotate the head back ever so slightly. But, as you can see, it makes a huge difference. Alright! Congratulations! We now have an idle animation!

### 03Step 3: Start walk animation

Create a new animation clip called 'Walk.”

This animation is a bit more technical. Here, we need to know a few essential things about walk locomotion. The walk animation's primary function is that the character is always touching the ground. Therefore, we should never have a pose where our character is airborne. Also, I use the word "pose" intentionally. When we animate in 2D, an action comprises certain key poses. In the scenario of the walk animation, we have one posture like this:

![Start walk animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-20.jpg)

Here we have the right foot (relative to the character) touching the ground as you wander.

Then, about six frames ahead, we have a "passing pose."

It contains a slight movement downwards. It further adds a realistic bobbing motion.

We must animate the character moving forward by moving the entire character game object. Don't move the surface by any other means except by dragging the character as the whole object.

Then, the "dynamic pose" with the left foot touching the ground this time.

![2d game dynamic pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-21.jpg)

This happens at frame twelve, and we are still forwarding the character.

Now, we just require a final passing pose.

And then we recreate the same pose!

Now, copy the first keyframe and paste it. Reposition the character on the X-axis to match the forward motion. Now, go back to your animation and tweak any limbs bending in the wrong direction.

![copy first keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-22.jpg)

We are done!

### 04Step 4: Run animation

For the Run animation, create one pose with the airborne character. The distance covered is also more significant than the walk animation. Besides, the run animation has a similar general structure, but we add one extra pose to improve the illusion ultimately.

Create a new animation folder or clip called "Run."

Tap the record tab and move the limbs to this pose:

![start run animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-23.jpg)

The armature, we found, was very fiddly, so be patient while trying to create this pose. This first dynamic pose means that we need to have the whole character move slightly up on the y-axis. Then, after forwarding the six frames, we drag the character in different positions and down while limbs reposition to make the first passing pose.

Go through these two keyframes to check if you have an experimental animation. Reposition the feet to avoid foot sliding.

Then, the second dynamic pose happens six frames forward:

Now, we have another passing posture at frame number 18:

![2d game passing pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-24.jpg)

And conclusively, we have our final dynamic pose and make it look like the first pose. An excellent place to begin is to copy the first frame and paste it at the end. Drag the character forward on the X-axis into the ideal place. Now move the limbs into roughly the exact position as the beginning pose.

### 05Step 5: Go back to animation and check

Now, you can go back through the animation and consider checking two things. Firstly, correct any unnaturally bent limbs.

![check 2d game animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-25.jpg)

### 06Step 6: Create a contact pose

Secondly, we are required to add a unique pose to this run cycle called a "Contact Pose," where we can visibly see the character make contact with the ground. This pose occurs a few frames after the dynamic pose and a few before the passing pose. It is simply the forward leg making early contact with the ground.

![2d game contact pose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/secret-to-make-2d-game-animation-26.jpg)

We need one of these before every passing pose. Also, while we're here, let's add a little more toe movement after passing each passing pose to make it look like the character got pushed off the ground.

So, this is the procedure to use the **best 2D animation software for game** **development** via Unity, and you can similarly continue to make jump animations, root motion, and more.

This tutorial mainly focused on animating a 2D character and dove deeper into the actual structure of an animation. Knowing these things will allow you to animate 2D characters and 3D characters as the principles are the same for each medium.
