The significant difference between a stop-motion puppet and other types is that they have an armature inside. An armature is the puppet's skeleton, a must to hold its position without sleeping for each captured frame. The stop motion puppet makeover should be precise to prevent it from breaking down or falling quickly. In addition, buying a stop-motion puppet armature might be pretty expensive, so making them by yourself is much more fun and cheaper.

To prevent any mishap during your stop-motion puppet making, your pupils should be as durable and lightweight as possible, and they must be designed based on what you will be doing and what kind of movement will be required of them. In essence, your story's overall purpose for creating the animation will be the ultimate factor in how your character is built and designed.

## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

![Xara 3D Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator7.png)

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

![TISFAT](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator10.png)

## Part 2 **8 Best Online Text GIF Generators to Make Animated Word GIFs**

And so, we move on to our next list! Here's where we introduce online solutions for animated text generation needs! So, all the tools on this list will not require any downloading, but they will require that you have internet while working!

### 01MotionDen

| PROS                                                                           | CONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

**RATING:** 4.5/5

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

![Wave.Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator12.png)

### 03MakerMoon

| PROS                                                                                                                                                       | CONS                                                                                                                                                     |

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

![MakerMoon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator13.png)

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

![Textanim](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator14.png)

### 05SnackThis

| PROS                                                                                                                                             | CONS                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

![SnackThis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator15.png)

### 06Animatron Studio

| PROS                                                                                                                    | CONS                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

![Animatron Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator16.png)

### 07Cool Text

| PROS                                                                        | CONS                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

![Cool Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator17.png)

### 08Loading.io

| PROS                                                                                                                                   | CONS                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

## Part 2 **8 Best Online Text GIF Generators to Make Animated Word GIFs**

And so, we move on to our next list! Here's where we introduce online solutions for animated text generation needs! So, all the tools on this list will not require any downloading, but they will require that you have internet while working!

### 01MotionDen

| PROS                                                                           | CONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

**RATING:** 4.8/5

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

**RATING:** 4.5/5

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

![Wave.Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator12.png)

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

### 05SnackThis

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

### 06Animatron Studio

| PROS                                                                                                                    | CONS                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

![Animatron Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator16.png)

### 07Cool Text

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

![Cool Text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator17.png)

### 08Loading.io

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

![Aurora 3D Maker: Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator1.png)

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

![Xara 3D Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator7.png)

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

Wave.Video, just like MotionDen, is a freemium software. You can try it out for free and start using their online video editing tools immediately to create short promos, logos, text gifs, etc. If you want access to some of its more advanced tools, however, you'll need to pay the premium price ($24-48), which, to you, may or may not be worth the vast library of polished animation properties.

**RATING:** 4.3/5

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation. It is, like the previous picks, an online video maker, but one with the focus on creating text-centric projects, which you can personalize in a number of ways to create logos, banners, short videos, gifs, etc.

### 04Textanim

| PROS                                                                                         | CONS                                                                          |

| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.

## Part 1 10 Best Animated Text Generators for 2021

For our first list, as promised, we've compiled a list of some of the best-animated text generators for 2021\. This is a general list of **text animation software** that you have to either download or install to use! If you want the online **text animation maker** list, that would be the one after this!

### 01Aurora: 3D Text Logo Maker

**PRICE:** FREE!

**RATING:** 4.5/5

The first **animated text generator** on our list is Aurora 3D. Aurora offers several different products, but the one that we're focusing on today is their 3D Text & Logo maker, which you can use to create some pretty advanced text animations with no sweat (as well as logos, of course, as the name implies)! The software is available for both Mac and Windows OS computers and desktops.

![Aurora 3D Maker: Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator1.png)

### 02Animaker

**PRICE:** Basic Plan = $10 per month!

**RATING:** 4.9/5

If you're looking for a more modern **text animation maker**, then Animaker might just be the one that you want! With this, you can create your 3D text animations from scratch, or choose from the dozens of templates and presets that they have for text, animated characters, icons, and other properties. This is more of a video editor than a strict text tool, but we thought it was important to give you a good variety. It's also not FREE, but you can try it for free for a time so that you can check if it's the one for you.

![Animaker Website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator2.png)

### 03OpenToonz

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

OpenToonz is a free **text animation software** that you can use for both basic and advanced 2D animation. It comes in several different languages (including Spanish and Japanese) and is very useful for creating simple text animation from scratch — no complicated tools. Just create and go! (It is also available in both Mac and Windows!)

![OpenToonz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator3.png)

### 04Reallusion

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 4/5

Reallusion is another open-source **text gif maker** that you can use if you're looking for something quick-and-easy. It supports a ton of different fonts, as well as ways to control the width, height, dimension, and style of every single object inside of their 3D properties gallery — giving you a lot of options for customization without any added cost!

![Reallusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator4.png)

### 05Express Animate

**PRICE:** $60 (full license)

**RATING:** 4/5

Express Animate, just like Open Toonz, it is more of an animation tool than one strictly created for text animation. However, it does work for that purpose as well. So, if you're willing to pay for the full license (which will cost $60), it could be a fairly good tool for you. Especially if you're interested in trying out more complex animations in the future.

![Express Animate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator5.png)

### 06Motion

**PRICE:** $47

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Motion is a Mac-only software. It is, just like some of the other options on this list, a great option for those looking for a tool that can help them with general animations (not just text animation — although it provides tools for that as well). The best part of Motion is undoubtedly its graphic library, where you have access to a ton of different presets and templates that you can use to simplify your text-animation-making.

![Motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator6.png)

### 07Xara 3D Maker

**PRICE:** $39.99

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Xara is another one of our paid options. It also comes complete with a range of different templates and presets that you can use in order to simplify your animation-generating. And, if you end up disliking the product after you try it, they do offer a 30-day money-back guarantee that you can take advantage of to make sure that you get the most out of your purchase.

### 08Easy Banner

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Easy Banner is a free animated text-banner-making software. It's only available in Windows, and its uses are limited to created banners. However, if that's what you're looking for? Then there's no reason not to try it out! Especially since it's free, and it comes with some pretty advanced customization options for getting the exact look that you want on your text banners.

![Easy Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator8.png)

### 09Falco GIF Animator

**PRICE:** FREE

**RATING:** 3.5/5

Falco Gif Animator is from the same creators of the previous item on this list (Softpedia!) The two offer similar tools, but for different purposes. Whilst the previous tool was for the creation of animated-text banners, this one is a GIF maker for icons, cursors, logos, etc. It's also FREE! So, if the project you're working on is applicable to its available features? Then you should definitely try it!

![Falco GIF Animator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/ways-you-can-master-to-find-10-best-free-animated-text-generator9.png)

### 10TISFAT

**PRICE:** Free

**RATING:** 3/5

TISFAT is the last of the tools that we have for you. It's an open-source stick animation tool that you can use to create text animations in whatever style or format that you desire. Making it more customizable than some of the other Softpedia options we just introduced, but still, one to consider based on your own circumstances.

MotionDen is a good entry point for **text animation online** solutions! It comes with tons of different templates that you can choose from to start working on your project immediately. MotionDen also offers a free version that you can test out for a limited number of times (one that gives you access to all their tools and their large resource library). So, you can decide to upgrade to their premium version whenever you want to (which will cost you around $29 per month!)

If you want to keep things simple, then MakerMoon might be your preferred choice for text animation.

| ● FREE online GIF maker● A variety of different font style options● Animated Effects options | ● Output is GIF only.● Limited animations options.● Limited resource library. |

**RATING:** 4/5

Textanim is a very bubbly and glittery kind of gif-maker, made for a more specific kind of project. But, if it works, it works! Plus, it's also the first completely FREE **online gif maker** on this list. So, you can test it out without having to make any commitments and use it literally anytime you feel like it. Unfortunately, though, it should be said that the animations here are mainly for effects (i.e., glowing, sparkling, etc.). The text won't actually move. So, if that's not what you're looking for? Then it might not be for you.

| ● FREE version for testing its tools and resources is available.● Lots of modern templates are available.● Editing tools for polishing projects. | ● If you’re using the FREE version, you will not be able to actually download your project.● You will also need to register to use it.● The customization options are limited. |

**RATING:** 4/5

SnackThis, unlike Textanim, is the type to cater to a wider array of users. Its templates are all very modern and professional-looking. So, if what you're looking for is to create text banners, logos, icons, etc. for your business? Then this definitely is an option that you may want to consider. It's pretty easy to use too! All you have to do is select the template that you want to use, and then edit it to match what you need.

| ● More customizable functions.● Advanced video editing options.● Pre-made templates are available for easier animating. | ● FREE Version is limited.● Might be difficult for inexperienced animators.● Output formats are MP4 and GIF only. |

**RATING:** 3.9/5

Animatron Studio is the tool to use if what you're looking for is customization. This tool is really better described as animation software, rather than a simple text generator. That means that you have more options than what you might see from other online text animation tools, but it also means that you'll need to put in more effort to come up with a polished-looking end-product.

| ● Easy and quick to use.● Various font customization options.● FREE to use. | ● Limited customizability.● Old-fashioned fonts. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

As a departure from the previous pick, we have Cool Text, which is its complete opposite! This is an older software and is definitely best described strictly as an **animated text generator**. With Cool Text, you can make logos or icons very easily. The options are, of course, more limited because of that, but it may very well be all you need based on the kind of project you're working on.

| ● Lots of fonts customization options.● Three different output formats (svg., png., and gif).● Also pre-set animations to choose from. | ● The FREE version is limited.● It isn’t as advanced as some of the other tools on this list. |

**RATING:** 3.5/5

For our last online text animator, we have Loading.io. This one is a very simple, and very straightforward kind of tool. It's also a freemium one, so you'll have to pay in order to unlock some of its features, but it's a solid contender for its customization tools, which gives a lot more options to choose from.
