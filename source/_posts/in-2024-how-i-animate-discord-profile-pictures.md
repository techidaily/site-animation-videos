Some tips you can keep in mind while creating logo are as follows:

**●** Create a logo with the minimum design because excessive design will make it tacky.

**●** Be sure not to add extra icons to the logo. This can be troublesome and make the logo unappealing.

**●** Go for white or a dark shade of background, because this will be helpful in making the text more visible.
