To be able to do something, you have to understand how that thing works. Before you can become a good anime voice actor, you have to actually understand the anime culture. How do animes usually set up for particular genres? Study the storylines, the hooks, the emotion required for different kinds of scenes. You need to actually know your stuff before you can even start thinking about dubbing any anime. Don't ever decide to become an anime voice actor if you don't like animes. Most of the scenes may appear silly to you not to talk of the vocabulary which may just sound weird and annoying to one who is not a fan.

### 2\. Train Your Voice Regularly
