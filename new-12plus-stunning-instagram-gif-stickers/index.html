You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>

There are many cartoon characters, but we will look into six cartoon character drawings with their tutorial videos.</p>
<h3 id="01-Smurfette"><a href="#01-Smurfette" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats. But her design is so intricate that getting it proper will give you a true sense of accomplishment. Her pigtails, like her leggings, might be challenging to master, so keep practicing.</p>
<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety. Yogi Bear is a beloved character from Jellystone Park. As long as you get his tie and collar just right, this guy is a breeze to draw.</p>
<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>

<h3 id="01-Smurfette-1"><a href="#01-Smurfette-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Smurfette"></a>01 Smurfette</h3><p>Smurfette stands out as the lone female Smurf in the entire bunch of blue critters around the village area. One of the rare designs with long hair and a dress is hers. Her design is a lot of fun to sketch.</p>
<p>So, in general, it’s best to work through the lesson as is, then turn it into Brainy, Papa, Joker, or even Smurf.</p>
<h3 id="01Angelica-Pickles-1"><a href="#01Angelica-Pickles-1" class="headerlink" title="01Angelica Pickles"></a>01Angelica Pickles</h3><p>Angelica Pickles is one of the most challenging characters to depict from The Rugrats.

<h3 id="03Yogi-Bear-1"><a href="#03Yogi-Bear-1" class="headerlink" title="03Yogi Bear"></a>03Yogi Bear</h3><p>Yogi Bear is a cartoon character on the sweeter side of the comic animal variety.

<h3 id="04Magilla-Gorilla-1"><a href="#04Magilla-Gorilla-1" class="headerlink" title="04Magilla Gorilla"></a>04Magilla Gorilla</h3><p>Magilla Gorilla is another bizarre creature from Hanna-catalog. Barbera’s Because he comes with a bow tie, a little cap, and suspenders, this design is a little more complicated. Not to mention his enormous clown shoes. These small details can be a pain to draw, but Magilla is a very charming gorilla.</p>
<h3 id="05Top-Cat-1"><a href="#05Top-Cat-1" class="headerlink" title="05Top Cat"></a>05Top Cat</h3><p>Even further back in time, in the 1960s, there was the ever-popular Top Cat.

You don’t have to be a Disney-grade animator to make it; start with simple minor characters. Animation is the art of bringing a 3D illustrated cartoon into life. It is created by projecting a sequence of images one after the other immediately. Let us discuss the essential things you need to note before animating characters.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Timeline is the most important for animation. Depending on the software, you have various options to change the duration and add effects.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Animation is generally preferable in 24 frames per second, which means the total number of people in the frame for one second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>There are two types of working they are one’s and two’s. 2D Animation is usually done in two’s, whereas 3D Animation is in one’s.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In hand-drawn animations, keyframes are more critical to maintain. The keyframe is the position for the cartoon as per animator has decided.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Breakdowns combine one or two keyframes, which decide the motion in between the keys.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>In-betweens are all the frames that come between to smooth the motion—automatically generated by the computer to move from key to key.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>Composting is creating or joining two or more images to create a single cartoon frame.</p>
