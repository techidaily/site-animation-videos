<p>When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to <strong>convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop</strong>, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. Its file format is a compressed image, and it is most suitable for animation. We all know that an animated GIF comprises a series of many still images. However, since these images play sequentially, it may appear as if they are in motion. It is that movement illusion that makes the animation effect come about.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>

<p>When someone mentions a GIF, what comes to your mind? Some people can picture what it means but wouldn’t describe that match. So, before we discuss how to <strong>convert mp4 to gif in Photoshop</strong>, it would be wise to define it briefly. First of all, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format. Its file format is a compressed image, and it is most suitable for animation. We all know that an animated GIF comprises a series of many still images. However, since these images play sequentially, it may appear as if they are in motion. It is that movement illusion that makes the animation effect come about.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Ensure that the Dimensions are Right</strong></p>
<p>When you start to convert <strong>mp4 to GIF using Photoshop</strong>, it is important to highlight some things that need to be done before anything else. Ensure that you set the resolution and dimensions right. Failure to do saw will see the size of your video determine that of your GIF. Beneath such occurrences, you may find yourself having a GIF that’s too large, and its quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>The dimensions you choose will depend on what you are working on at any one particular time. For instance, a 720 x 300 layout is recommended for a banner ad GIF. If there is something that one can’t stress enough is the importance of ensuring that you use pixels. As for the resolution, keep in mind that a low resolution translates to a small file size. In this case, you are at privilege to choose between two units, pixels and inches.</p>
<p>Additionally, set the color mode. Since GIFs are meant for screens, ensure that you select the RGB color mode. Finally, click on Create, which opens a new document, and start following these steps to convert Mp4 to GIF Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import the Video you want to convert from MP4 to GIF Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Remember that we already opened Photoshop by pressing Create. Now, the next thing would be to navigate to File followed by Import before selecting the Video Frames to Layers option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set Up the Following Settings Accordingly</strong></p>
<p>After choosing the video file, choose Open, and a dialogue box with several options and a preview of the video appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-converting-mp4-to-gif-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="preview of the video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>The radio buttons give you two options to choose from. The “From Beginning to End” is the ideal choice if you want the whole video to be converted to GIF. However, if you want to focus on a section of the video, select “Selected Range Only.” On the other hand, the checkbox allows you to limit the video to 2 frames. Simply tick it, and Photoshop will automatically ensure that only two frames of the video are left.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check the “Make Frame Animation” checkbox. Once all these settings are set as recommended and depending on preference, Photoshop will export your video as several frames. In the event that the program crashes, all is not lost. You can fix it by reducing the video’s quality and then try importing it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop also gives you several options to help you edit your frames to perfection. In most cases, these settings are ideal for manipulating the quality of your GIF. Interestingly, it is possible to preview how the GIF will look before committing to any change. So expect two panes, right and left. The left one allows you to see the preview, whereas its right counterpart helps you edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Alternatively, select one of the preset choices. If you do so, there is no requirement The bottom line is that the tool makes to make any changes. That doesn’t mean you can’t choose a Preset option and then edit it to your preferences. Expect the quality of the GIF to decrease and the size to be relatively small. Right below the Preset, don’t forget to confirm that the selected option is GIF.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save the GIF</strong></p>
<p>Once satisfied by the GIF created, save these frames as animated GIFs. Go to File, then Export, followed by Save for Web (Legacy).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.</p>

Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.</p>
<h3 id="01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients"><a href="#01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients" class="headerlink" title="01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients"></a>01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients</h3><p>Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.</p>
<h3 id="03Educating-New-Professionals"><a href="#03Educating-New-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="03Educating New Professionals"></a>03Educating New Professionals</h3><p>For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.</p>
<h3 id="04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool"><a href="#04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="04Used As A Marketing Tool"></a>04Used As A Marketing Tool</h3><p>Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.</p>
<h3 id="05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional"><a href="#05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional" class="headerlink" title="05Marketing To Medical Professional"></a>05Marketing To Medical Professional</h3><p>While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.</p>

Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-1"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-1" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures.

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-3D-Medical-Animation-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-3D-Medical-Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?"></a>Part 1 What is 3D Medical Animation?</h2><p>A 3D medical animation can be termed as an animation that is used for different tasks in the healthcare and medical industry. These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations-3"><a href="#Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations"></a>Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations</h2><p>3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.</p>
<h3 id="01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients-3"><a href="#01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients-3" class="headerlink" title="01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients"></a>01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients</h3><p>Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-3"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-3" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.</p>
<h3 id="03Educating-New-Professionals-3"><a href="#03Educating-New-Professionals-3" class="headerlink" title="03Educating New Professionals"></a>03Educating New Professionals</h3><p>For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.</p>
<h3 id="04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool-3"><a href="#04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="04Used As A Marketing Tool"></a>04Used As A Marketing Tool</h3><p>Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.</p>
<h3 id="05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional-3"><a href="#05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional-3" class="headerlink" title="05Marketing To Medical Professional"></a>05Marketing To Medical Professional</h3><p>While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.</p>
