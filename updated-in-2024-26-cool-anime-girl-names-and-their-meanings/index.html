<p><strong>What’s new with Adobe Animate?</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Web Fonts</strong></p>
<p>Now you can use a vast library of Adobe web fonts with Adobe Animate. These high-quality fonts are available in HTML5 canvas documents.</p>

<p>Batman or “Bruce Wayne” is an orphan billionaire living a carefree life. Yet, he leads the gods and exceptional ones like they do not matter much. The technology and the will Batman demonstrates are peculiar. No wonder Batman animated movies are one of the bestselling of all time.
