These animations are used for several different tasks like explaining and detailing the concepts to the patients, compelling the investors, training professionals, marketing devices and drugs, and more. Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations"><a href="#Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations"></a>Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations</h2><p>3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.</p>
<h3 id="01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients"><a href="#01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients" class="headerlink" title="01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients"></a>01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients</h3><p>Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.</p>
<h3 id="03Educating-New-Professionals"><a href="#03Educating-New-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="03Educating New Professionals"></a>03Educating New Professionals</h3><p>For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.</p>
<h3 id="04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool"><a href="#04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="04Used As A Marketing Tool"></a>04Used As A Marketing Tool</h3><p>Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.</p>
<h3 id="05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional"><a href="#05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional" class="headerlink" title="05Marketing To Medical Professional"></a>05Marketing To Medical Professional</h3><p>While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.</p>

Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-1"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-1" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures.

Depending on the target audience, the animations can be created by taking the help of specialized industries or using animated software.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations-3"><a href="#Part-2-Uses-Of-3D-Medical-Animations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations"></a>Part 2 Uses Of 3D Medical Animations</h2><p>3D animations have proved to be useful in the healthcare and medical industry in several ways. Below we have gathered some of the key benefits of the same.</p>
<h3 id="01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients-3"><a href="#01Using-As-A-Mode-Of-Communication-With-Patients-3" class="headerlink" title="01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients"></a>01Using As A Mode Of Communication With Patients</h3><p>Communication with the patients is one of the major uses of 3D animation in the healthcare field. Using animations, the communication with the patients can be enhanced in several ways. Explaining complex medical conditions and procedures to patients is difficult and here the animations help to a great extent. Going through animation will make a patient well prepared to see the doctor and learn about his&#x2F;her medical condition or procedure to be performed. Patients do not have medical knowledge and these animations help them to know their condition, scenario, and procedure in a simple way that they can understand.</p>
<h3 id="02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-3"><a href="#02Training-Of-Medical-Professionals-3" class="headerlink" title="02Training Of Medical Professionals"></a>02Training Of Medical Professionals</h3><p>Medical professionals need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and practices and for this, they need to undergo training from time to time. 3D animations for the topics to be studied help them in better understanding the concepts and the procedures. Moreover, animations also help in e-learning.</p>
<h3 id="03Educating-New-Professionals-3"><a href="#03Educating-New-Professionals-3" class="headerlink" title="03Educating New Professionals"></a>03Educating New Professionals</h3><p>For the new students using 3D animations is a great way to teach complex medical topics which otherwise explaining them orally or visually are not that effective. Animations can be used to educate about different topics like the anatomy of a human body, medical procedures, drug mechanisms, use of devices, and more.</p>
<h3 id="04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool-3"><a href="#04Used-As-A-Marketing-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="04Used As A Marketing Tool"></a>04Used As A Marketing Tool</h3><p>Since the presentation of medical information is difficult, marketing in the healthcare industry is quite a challenge. Moreover, the investors do not possess any medical know-how and the task of marketing becomes even more difficult. Thus, using 3D medical animations can be helpful here to explain the products, devices, and other things. Marketing of medicines to patients can also be done using animated mascots and characters.</p>
<h3 id="05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional-3"><a href="#05Marketing-To-Medical-Professional-3" class="headerlink" title="05Marketing To Medical Professional"></a>05Marketing To Medical Professional</h3><p>While marketing products and devices to medical professionals is not difficult in terms of knowledge or know-how as they are from the medical background. But with multiple marketing teams approaching them, time is a limitation and thus presentation needs to be short yet informative which can be achieved through the use of animations. Moreover, these animations can be sent to professionals through emails or by sharing a website link.</p>

<p>Thanks to the animation aspect, it has become relatively cheap to do advertisements with cartoons instead of real people.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Good-Cartoons-to-Draw"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Good-Cartoons-to-Draw" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?"></a>Part 1 What Are Good Cartoons to Draw?</h2><p>As far as good cartoons are concerned, expect about 5 popular types. These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<h3 id="03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels"><a href="#03-Comic-Strips-or-Panels" class="headerlink" title="03 Comic Strips or Panels"></a>03 Comic Strips or Panels</h3><p>In most cases, these are regular features characterized by established or known characters and usually displayed in newspapers.</p>
<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

<h3 id="05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons"><a href="#05-Editorial-or-Political-Cartoons" class="headerlink" title="05 Editorial or Political Cartoons"></a>05 Editorial or Political Cartoons</h3><p>These cartoons are also made for the newspapers. Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing"><a href="#Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing"></a>Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing</h5><p>Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.</p>
<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-1"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-1"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons-1"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons-1" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So.

<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-1"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>

The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-1"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-1"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>

<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-1"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>

<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-1"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>

If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-2"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-2" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-2"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-2" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons-2"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons-2" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-2"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-2" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-2"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-2"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-2"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-2"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-2"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-2"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-2"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

So, what do you do if you want to create a female one instead? These are some of the steps to follow as you do so.</p>
<p>The procedure is not that different. However, consider that women’s facial structures are more delicate than those of their male counterparts. Some of the things that stand out include long hair, a small nose, a thin chin, thin eyebrows, and large, expressive eyelashes. Large pupils will also do, especially if you are good at drawing.</p>

These <strong>cartoons to draw</strong> include:</p>
<h3 id="01-Illustrative-Cartoons-3"><a href="#01-Illustrative-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Illustrative Cartoons"></a>01 Illustrative Cartoons</h3><p>They are the most suitable cartoons to draw when portraying particular ideas directly and simply.</p>
<p>The cartoons are primarily used in advertisements, teaching aids, and explaining stories. They also have text that explains them further.</p>
<p>It explains why they are common in school books, making them perfect for explaining content or subject.</p>

<h3 id="02-Animated-Cartoons-3"><a href="#02-Animated-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="02 Animated Cartoons"></a>02 Animated Cartoons</h3><p>It is important to note that these cartoons are drawn using computers despite looking as if they are hand-drawn. One thing that makes them stand out is that they seem to be in action and movement.</p>
<p>As much as that’s how they seem from the viewer’s perspective, that’s far from the truth. They are just drawn in series, and since the first one will differ from the second one, there is that illusion of movement created.</p>

<p>Just like the animated cartoons, they are showcased in series to tell or illustrate a story. The series of panels have words said by the various characters.</p>
<p>The words are usually in balloons, and a single comic strip may cover a single or double page of a newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="04-Gag-Cartoons-3"><a href="#04-Gag-Cartoons-3" class="headerlink" title="04 Gag Cartoons"></a>04 Gag Cartoons</h3><p>As the name gag suggests, these cartoons revolve around jokes. These single-paneled cartoons often make fun of human beings.</p>
<p>Through overstatements, humor resonates from what is drawn. They can either serve as entertainment or point out, if not make fun of, people, especially their mistakes and faults. Besides the cartoon, expect a caption that’s often a single sentence.</p>

Expect them to be a single drawing on an editorial page. It sheds more light on a particular newspaper’s editorial comment.</p>
<p>As much as some have captions, that’s not always the case. Just like the gag cartoons, they ridicule people, but the editorial ones focus on celebrities.</p>

So, feel encouraged because you stand a chance also to become an expert in the long run. All you need to do is take the first step. Fortunately, we are here to hold your hand as you do so. So. Without further ado, let’s get started.</p>
<h3 id="01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-3"><a href="#01-Cartoon-Painting-of-a-Young-Character-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character"></a>01 Cartoon Painting of a Young Character</h3><p><strong>These are the steps you need to follow when doing so:</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step-1Start-with-the-face-3"><a href="#Step-1Start-with-the-face-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Start with the face"></a>Step 1Start with the face</h5><p>The face is significant, especially when it comes to cartoon painting. It has complex as well as simple parts. For example, the face itself is pretty basic since you will need to begin with a circle.</p>
<p>After that, draw a horizontal and vertical line and ensure that they intersect in the middle.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing-3"><a href="#Step-2Draw-the-eyes-by-drawing-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing"></a>Step 2Draw the eyes by drawing</h5><p>Draw the eyes by drawing an oval and ensuring that the top side is slightly tilting to the side.</p>
<p>Do the same thing on the other side since the norm is a pair of eyes. The gap between the two should also be sensible.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step-3Draw-eyebrows-3"><a href="#Step-3Draw-eyebrows-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Draw eyebrows"></a>Step 3Draw eyebrows</h5><p>On the upper side of the eye, ensure that the lines are slightly thick. The eyebrows also need to be placed above the eyes, slightly above the thick line representing the eyelashes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step-4Draw-jaw-3"><a href="#Step-4Draw-jaw-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4Draw jaw"></a>Step 4Draw jaw</h5><p>After that, start shaping the jaw. Keep in mind that it plays a huge role in determining whether the character will look thin or fat. Additionally, how you draw the jaw determines whether the character will be old or young and how old or young the person will look.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step-5Draw-nose-3"><a href="#Step-5Draw-nose-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Draw nose"></a>Step 5Draw nose</h5><p>Design the nose and ensure that you don’t put many details. The good thing about the nose is that a tip is enough to serve the purpose. Another common approach when drawing the nose is doing so as if you are viewing it from the side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-6Draw-mouth-3"><a href="#Step-6Draw-mouth-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6Draw mouth"></a>Step 6Draw mouth</h5><p>Next, draw the mouth and consider the age of your character as you do so. If it is a child, despite the gender, stick to simplicity. You should also avoid drawing the lips. Preferably, go for the good, expressive trace since it never disappoints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-7Draw-ears-3"><a href="#Step-7Draw-ears-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 7Draw ears"></a>Step 7Draw ears</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-8Draw-haircut-3"><a href="#Step-8Draw-haircut-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 8Draw haircut"></a>Step 8Draw haircut</h5><p>Proceed to the ears and in relation to whether the character is facing the camera or not. If your character is looking at the camera, you should see the front side view. Therefore, it won’t make sense to display the internal cavities in this case.</p>
<p>As scary as it may look, you need not be an expert to make the haircut look perfect. Additionally, there is no constant way of drawing the haircut, and you are at liberty to practice as much creativity as possible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, please don’t take it lightly since it can be quite descriptive. For instance, the hair is used to tell the personality of a character. Practice makes perfect, and you better keep doing it until you get it right. Ensure that what you draw shows the age and character of the cartoons to draw as perfectly as possible.</p>
<p>So far, our focus has been on a young character. However, that’s not always the case explaining why we will look at a cartoon painting of an old character.</p>

Start with the eyes and add their pupils, eyebrows and don’t forget to add wrinkles.</p>
<p>Since the character is old compared to the previous one, ensure that the eyebrows are thick. They should occupy more space of the forehead.</p>

Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

<h3 id="02Van-Aken"><a href="#02Van-Aken" class="headerlink" title="02Van Aken"></a>02Van Aken</h3><p>Van Aken is another popular clay brand that’s ideal for <strong>claymation animations</strong>.

Some animators also mix Van Aken with Pupper Putty to make the characters look more stunning under the perfect lighting conditions.</p>
<h3 id="03Sargent-Art"><a href="#03Sargent-Art" class="headerlink" title="03Sargent Art"></a>03Sargent Art</h3><p>Sargent Art is a brand that primarily designs clays for sculpting.

<h3 id="04Sculpey"><a href="#04Sculpey" class="headerlink" title="04Sculpey"></a>04Sculpey</h3><p>Sculpey is a clay brand that designs polymer-based clays that are relatively better than the traditional ceramic mud clays. This type of clay is made up of plastic and it’s comparatively more pliable than any regular clay. And, once you have your sculpture ready, you can simply place the cay model in an oven and make it rock solid within a few minutes.</p>
<h3 id="05Plastilina"><a href="#05Plastilina" class="headerlink" title="05Plastilina"></a>05Plastilina</h3><p>Finally, Plastilina is also a great option for <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> models.

<h2 id="Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone-3"><a href="#Part-1-Ways-to-Make-Stop-Motion-Videos-with-Clay-Using-Your-Phone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone"></a>Part 1 Ways to Make Stop Motion Videos with Clay Using Your Phone</h2><p>So, now that you are familiar with the basic concept of <strong>clay stop animation</strong>, let’s understand how you can get started with claymation animations. Ideally, if you are an absolute beginner, you would want to start by understanding the dynamics of creating clay models first. Whether you are going to create a animation or a simple stop motion clip, the models will play a major role in the story and it would be important that these models look appealing.</p>
<p>When it comes to capturing the motion, you don’t need any expensive cameras. You can easily shoot the entire motion on your phone as well. Today, even the basic smartphones come with recording features and they are enough to capture the movement of your clay models. However, if you want to keep the production quality as high as possible, make sure to invest in a decent tripod. A tripod will ensure that your <strong>stop motion claymation</strong> doesn’t feel jerky at all.</p>
<p>After you have crafted the clay models and purchased the tripod, the next step would be to write down a script for the animation. Whether you are creating a short video or a 3-hour long movie, a script will ensure that you don’t miss out on any important scenes while recording the animation. There are multiple script writing software you can find online that’ll speed up the entire process. However, as a beginner, you can also pen down your script in a regular MS Word document. Lack of resources should never come between your creativity.</p>
<p>Once the script is final, the next phase would be to record the <strong>stop motion animation claymation</strong>. This is the stage where you have to be extra careful because you’ll practically be recording the storyline of your animation. Simply fire up the smartphone’s camera and start shooting each frame one-by-one. Keep in mind that shooting a stop motion animation is pretty time-consuming and it can even take up to 5-7 hours to get the job done. So, make sure to grab your cup of coffee and stay patient throughout the process.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Canva"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Canva?"></a>Part 1 What is Canva?</h2><p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="2-3-Video"><a href="#2-3-Video" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva"></a>How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva</h3><p>Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Canva?"></a>Part 1 What is Canva?</h2><p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-1.png"
                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-2.png"
                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-3.png"
                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-2"><a href="#2-1-Image-2" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/Animated-Elements-In-Canva-4.png"

<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text-2"><a href="#2-2-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva text animations"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video-2"><a href="#2-3-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Make-Elements-Move-In-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-3-Make-Elements-Move-In-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva"></a>Part 3 Make Elements Move In Canva</h2><h3 id="How-To-Arrange-The-Order-Of-An-Animation-2"><a href="#How-To-Arrange-The-Order-Of-An-Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?"></a>How To Arrange The Order Of An Animation?</h3><p>The brilliant thing about Canva is that you can decide the order you want to create your animation. The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.</p>
<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>

This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>
