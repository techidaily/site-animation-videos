<p>Optionally, you can also create GIFs from video files, but you should keep in mind that the sound is going to be removed automatically, as GIF files cannot contain audio.</p>

<p>Mind Inventory is an Indian software development company working towards designing high-quality websites and mobile applications. Their website is a perfect example of how one should use navigation bars in a website to improve the overall design scheme. In addition to placing links to all the important web pages, Mind Inventory has also introduced dedicated animations to make the drop-down menu appearance more pleasing.</p>
<h3 id="07FHOKE-3"><a href="#07FHOKE-3" class="headerlink" title="07FHOKE"></a>07FHOKE</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-create-an-animated-sticky-navbar-07.JPG"
                      alt="FHOKE"
                ></p>
<p>FHOKE’s navigation bar is one of the most aesthetically pleasing animated navbars that you can replicate on your website to maximize its performance. A white-colored navbar automatically turns gray as soon as you scroll down to maintain the contrast of the entire web page.</p>
<p>There are dedicated links to other web pages as well. However, you won’t find any drop-down menus. In case your website also has limited web pages, you can also replicate this <strong>animated sticky navbar</strong> to make it more appealing.</p>
<h3 id="08H-M-3"><a href="#08H-M-3" class="headerlink" title="08H&amp;M"></a>08H&amp;M</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-create-an-animated-sticky-navbar-08.JPG"
                      alt="H&amp;M"
                ></p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, H&amp;M is a clothing brand that’s popular across the globe. At first, H&amp;M’s official website may look pretty basic, but its navigation bar is backed by a great marketing strategy. The bar contains all the product page categories that’ll direct you to any product page within a single click.</p>
