<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>

<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Make use of a Gboard.</strong></p>
<p>Enter the chat of the friend or person to whom you want to send the GIF and maximize or open the keyboard using the text bar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save and share"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the GIF you want.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a GIF from the collection or catalog that you’d want to utilize and submit it.</p>

<p>• Go to Settings&gt; System&gt; Languages and Input&gt; Virtual Keyboard and select it.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Canva"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Canva?"></a>Part 1 What is Canva?</h2><p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image"><a href="#2-1-Image" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>The ones with the crown are premium features exclusive to Canva Pro, the paid subscription.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Text"><a href="#2-2-Text" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video"><a href="#2-3-Video" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

The component elements of a Canva backdrop are the text, audio, images, video. These form the basis for the animated elements in Canva.</p>
<p>You can work on whichever component feels more accessible to you. Canva also allows users to make videos for title sequences and end-cards for video sharing platforms.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva"><a href="#How-to-Change-The-Duration-Of-Animated-Graphic-In-Canva" class="headerlink" title="How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva"></a>How to Change The Duration Of Animated Graphic In Canva</h3><p>Once you’ve added a video element to your presentation, you’ll notice that the timer disappears from the production. This is because the presentation only lasts the duration of the video.</p>
<p>If you go to the next slide of the presentation, you can often notice a timer available. It has a default duration of five seconds. If you click on the clock symbol, a menu with “Timing” will appear with a slider. You can adjust the timing from 0.1 seconds up to a maximum of 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Canva has become a buzzword in the designing and animation world. It’s a graphic design platform that allows users to create graphic designs for social media, for presentations, documents, cards for any memorable occasion. It was founded by Melanie Perkins, an Australian technology entrepreneur.</p>
<p>It allows users to work individually or across teams. With real-time live changes made available, Canva is pushing the boundary of what is possible and making it more accessible. With the introduction of animated elements in Canva, the possibilities for design horizons have expanded significantly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-2"><a href="#Part-2-Animate-An-Element-In-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva"></a>Part 2 Animate An Element In Canva</h2><p>There are one of two ways to go about creating an animation. You can work off an existing template or create a custom template. If you’re wondering how to animate individual elements in Canva then this guide is for you.</p>
<p>The first step to animation is building your custom static design. For that you need to go to Canva and select “Create a Design” option. Once you do, select the type of content you’re attempting to create- from Instagram posts to a presentation or an A4 document.</p>
<p>Think of the text font you’re going to use.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should look into adding elements that suit your text on the design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Animated elements Canva"
                ></p>
<p>You can upload photographs into your creation with the upload button. This also extends to uploading audio that you want to use on video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adding pictures to Canva image editor"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re done with these steps, you should have a customized static design that you can use. Let’s now look at how to animate individual elements in Canva. These elements are the text, the image, audio, and video.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Image-2"><a href="#2-1-Image-2" class="headerlink" title="2.1 Image"></a>2.1 Image</h3><p>To add an image to Canva, you need to upload it in the ‘Upload’ tab on Canva. Once you do, the image can then be selected for display on your presentation.</p>
<p>For images, you can also choose to frame them within the “elements” tab. There are two kinds of elements. One which allows photographs to be embedded in them and ones which don’t. You can choose any element as a frame for your embedded image.</p>
<p>The next thing is to choose the “Animate” button. This will open up different options for animation features. The animate button allows a preview of what each animation does in real-time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-2-Text-2"><a href="#2-2-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Text"></a>2.2 Text</h3><p>Add in the text you want to see to the image. The text can be in any style that you choose. Canva offers a variety of fonts that you can use to customize the color, size, and duration of the display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h3 id="2-3-Video-2"><a href="#2-3-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Video"></a>2.3 Video</h3><p>If you’re ready to take your content creation skills to the next level, this section is for you. You have the option of adding videos to Canva as well. Just load the video you have on hand to the Canva “Uploads” section. Introduce the video clip to the design.</p>
<p>Another way to embed the video is by using an element and embedding your video within it.</p>
<p>With video, you also have options like cropping, adjusting the playback. With playback, you can choose “Autoplay Video” and “Loop Video.” These are basic options for how the video can be played. The crop function allows you to trim the video to any point in time.</p>
<p>On top of this, you can use the animate button, which can create options for how the video is introduced to the backdrop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Canva playback animations"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to remove the animation, you need to go to the “Animate” button and select the ‘None’ option to delete the animation from the design.</p>
<p>You can opt to animate either just the elements or you can animate the slide on the whole with “Page Animations.”</p>

<p>Now, when it comes to video marketing, the majority of businesses prefer choosing 2D animations. The reason being 2D animations have a lower production cost and they still offer complete liberty over creativity. However, it’s worth noting that editing a visually engaging 2D animation requires expertise.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s always an ideal solution to hire a dedicated <strong>2D animation company</strong>. Such organizations have experienced video editors who specialize in 2D video editing and can craft the perfect 2D animation for your brand. In this article, we are going to walk you through a list of the top 12 <strong>2D animation studios</strong> you can hire to launch an enticing marketing video for your business.</p>

In layman’s terms, a 2D animation is a video where the movements are represented in two-dimensional space. The subjects in the video can either move forward or backward, but they can’t be allowed to move in a third dimension (depth).</p>
<p>Now, even though there are tools you can use to edit a 2D animation on your own, the process is time-consuming and requires certain expertise. And, since the primary objective of creating a 2D animation video is to engage potential customers, it’s always necessary to be super creative with the editing approach. This is the reason why the majority of brands hire professional 2D animation studios for the job.</p>
<p>The cost to create a 2D animation video can range anywhere between $1,000 to $10,000.

<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

<p>This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn’t make it any less fun</p>

<p>The story’s main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She’s a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets “The Owl Lady” Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn’t stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.</p>

<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom.

<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however.

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The first on this ascending list of ours is the TV series, ‘Star vs. the Forces of Evil’ This is an American animated ‘magical-girl’ television show that was inspired by similar tropes of the kind that were popular in the East. The show has long run its course, with the last episodes having been aired in 2019 (making it a perfect show to binge from start to finish)</p>
<p>The main character of the show, Star Butterfly, is a magical princess and the heir to the royal throne of the Butterfly Kingdom. From this alone, you could probably guess the kind of demographics this show has But, to explain further, once she reached the age of 14, she was given the family heirloom wand — only to accidentally set fire to the family castle and be sent over to Earth to train her magic more carefully</p>
<h2 id="Top-9-Gargoyles-3"><a href="#Top-9-Gargoyles-3" class="headerlink" title="Top 9   Gargoyles"></a>Top 9   <strong>Gargoyles</strong></h2><p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1994–1996 [2 Seasons, 30m per episode]</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We go back into the older <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> a bit with this next series It ran from 1994 to 1996 for two seasons (with the third season having been called ‘Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles’ instead.) Unlike the next item on this list, this one is definitely more suitable for an older audience. The tone of the story is quite grim, despite being your general action&#x2F;adventure show.</p>
<p>It tells the story of preternatural creatures called Gargoyles — all of whom were cursed for over a thousand years to turn to stone during the day Modern times see the release of this curse, however. And, now, these gargoyles must contend with the realities of living in modern-day (at the time the series was aired) New York City.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The fourth most popular of the <strong>Disney animated shows</strong> on IMBD is Phineas and Ferb This is an action&#x2F;comedy series that ran all from 2007 to 2015 And yes, that does mean that this show is 100% now binge-able from start to end</p>
<p>This show follows the story of Phineas Flynn and his stepbrother Ferb Fletcher. The two are quite young (which perhaps is at odds with the actual demographics of the show, which make up primarily of young adults and adults), not having even reached their early teenage years just yet Each episode starts with the two brothers working on something new and exciting projects to do with construction. Often not very feasible for children of their age, but hey That doesn’t make it any less fun</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> While still quite new and yet to be finished (the series is ongoing and had its premiere in 2020 on the Disney Channel), ‘The Owl House’ is another Disney animated show that you may be interested in This story was created by Dana Terrace, and was quite well-regarded for having unabashedly LGBTQ+ character representation (it was even the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple as main characters)</p>
<p>The story’s main protagonist is Luz Noceda. She’s a teenage girl that somehow ended up traveling into another world. There she meets “The Owl Lady” Elda Clawthorne and her housemate King as a human without any powers of her own, the world is quite unusual for Luz, but that doesn’t stop her from trudging forward in an attempt to become a witch by apprenticing at the Owl House.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>

                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-12"><a href="#In-this-article-12" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>

                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img

<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator"><a href="#01Add-the-animator" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation"><a href="#03Create-an-animation" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="unity animation"
                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-13"><a href="#In-this-article-13" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-1"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject"></a>02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject</h3><p>Now, you may have different subjects. We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-1"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-1" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-1"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-1" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-1"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-1" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-1"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-1" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-1"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-1" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>

So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>

<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-14"><a href="#In-this-article-14" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-2"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-2" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG"
                      alt="delete animation folder unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-2"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-2" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject"></a>02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject</h3><p>Now, you may have different subjects. We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG"
                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-2"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-2"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-2" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-2"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-2" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-2"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-2" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-2"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-2" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-2"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-2" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>

<p>Unity is an IDE interface all designed exclusively for game developers. However, you can do much more with Unity than game development. But, our main concern here is something else than this subject. You’re looking for easy tutorials on <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="unity animation"
                ></p>
<p>And luckily, we’ve got you covered as we’ve briefly explained how to perform <strong>Unity stop animation from looping</strong> and the steps to make a smooth animation.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-15"><a href="#In-this-article-15" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Used for?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Used-for-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Used for?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Used for?</h2><p>Unity is a software tool friendly to all the game developers out there. This tool is used by the large community of game developers to power and create their game development projects. And, the software is more of a professional means and not a simple pared-down ‘game builder .’Unity also offers one of the most significant inbuilt features like rendering, physics, and collision detection. Thus, one of the powerful aspects of Unity is that game developers need not go out of the box and create everything from scratch. Instead, they are available with the physics engine required to develop games quickly. Another robust feature of Unity is that it includes an excellent ‘Asset Store’ where developers can upload their creations and showcase them to the whole community. So, that’s Unity and its uses in a broader scope!</p>
<p>Before we take you through the next section, it’s important to mention that Unity is also known as cross-platform IDE, where IDE stands for ‘integrated development environment.’ So, it can be called more of an interface with access to all the tools and resources required to develop games.</p>
<p>Apart from the game development, Unity is known for other excellent usage purposes as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simulations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Architectural Visualization</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Previsualization for Film</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Interactive Experiences</p>
<p>Among these features only, we’ll describe <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stop-Animation-Playing-in-Loop-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?"></a>Part 2 How to Stop Animation Playing in Loop in Unity?</h2><p>As we said, we’ll describe to you the most accessible definition of how to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>Animation in Unity</strong>. Thus, there are simple steps that we’d like to define firsthand before explaining the whole procedure with an image-centric step-by-step guide.</p>
<p>So, those simple steps to <strong>stop motion animation in After Effects</strong> in the loop also go like below:</p>
<p>Step 1 Go to the <strong>Project</strong> tab and select <strong>Animation</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open the <strong>Inspector</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Step 3 Uncheck the checkbox <strong>Loop Time</strong>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>We’ll describe the same, i.e., <strong>Unity stop animation</strong> from looping through the step guide below.</p>
<p>In this guide, we’ll explain right from applying the Animation so that you’d understand better. So, let’s begin without any further ado!</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Delete-animation-folder-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1 Delete animation folder"></a>01Step 1 Delete animation folder</h3><p>We have already created an animation folder in the folder named as own Animation, so click that folder, click the animation folder, and then another folder along with as shown below. Hold the Shift key and click another folder. Then, right-click the <strong>Delete</strong> tab as depicted below.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can also delete the Animation if you wish.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-1.JPG"
                      alt="delete animation folder unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-an-animation-for-the-subject-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject"></a>02Step 2 Create an animation for the subject</h3><p>Now, you may have different subjects. We’re creating Animation on Mobile Joystick for reference, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-2.JPG"
                      alt="create-animation-unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, hit the <strong>Create</strong> tab on the Unity panel below. Then, proceed to save your Animation in the folder you’ve already created for the same.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-3.JPG"
                      alt="create and save unity animation"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Give-positions-to-the-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3 Give positions to the animation"></a>03Step 3 Give positions to the animation</h3><p>Firstly, hit the red-icon button used for recording, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-4.JPG"
                      alt="click record button unity"
                ></p>
<p>Give the position on the left side after you click the button. And, then, clicking almost near to 3you can give the position to the right-hand side as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-5.JPG"
                      alt="give position to animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, the animation has been set. You can see the animation from left to right if you click the <strong>Play</strong> button. So, here, you can see the results of infinite loop animation, which won’t stop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-6.JPG"
                      alt="infinite loop animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>You can follow two ways to <strong>stop this Animation in Unity</strong> from looping, and we’ll describe both methods below.</p>
<h3 id="04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-1-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1"></a>04Step 4 Stop animation Unity Way 1</h3><p>Go to the animation folder where you’ve created the animation and click the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-7.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you have to uncheck the <strong>Loop</strong> <strong>Time</strong> tab on the top-right corner of the Unity panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-8.JPG"
                      alt="click new animation unity 2"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-3"><a href="#05Step-5-Stop-animation-Unity-Way-2-3" class="headerlink" title="05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2"></a>05Step 5 Stop animation Unity Way 2</h3><p>Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Animator</strong> tab on the top of the Unity panel and double-tap the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button. Then, it will also delete or uncheck the loop time, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-9.JPG"
                      alt="double-tap new animation unity"
                ></p>
<p>These were all the steps to <strong>stop</strong> <strong>animation Unity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Smooth-an-Animation-in-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?"></a>Part 3 How to Smooth an Animation in Unity?</h2><p>After done with <strong>Unity stop animation</strong>, it’s time to smooth your Unity animation. Again, we will describe it simply if you’re used to the Unity platform and then with a step guide with respective screenshots.</p>
<p>So, stay tuned until the end to reveal the easy steps of smoothing an animation in Unity.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>Dopesheet</strong> at the bottom of the animation window. Then, you need to switch to the ‘Curves’ view once you create your Animation in the Dopesheet. These animation curves help you accelerate and decelerate animations so that the movement and other things can stop and start smoothly.</p>
<p>So, let’s begin with the step guide tutorial on the same as follows:</p>
<p>For reference, take an example of a metronome object imported from Blender to Unity. Here, we’ve grouped all the pendulum objects under one rotation so that when we move the pendulum, it pivots to the correct point, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-10.JPG"
                      alt="import metronome object unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="01Add-the-animator-3"><a href="#01Add-the-animator-3" class="headerlink" title="01Add the animator"></a>01Add the animator</h3><p>So, the first step begins with adding the <strong>Animator</strong> component to the parent object. You can do this by clicking the <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Component</strong> tab on the Unity panel’s left side, searching for <strong>Animator</strong>, and clicking the <strong>Animator</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also need a controller to control the animations. Go to your animation folder, right-click, and select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animator</strong> <strong>Controller</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-11.JPG"
                      alt="click animator controller unity"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s call or give it a name metronome animator as shown below.</p>
<p>Then, you need to drag this into your animator component. Again, you need to go to your animations folder, right-click, select <strong>Create</strong>&gt; <strong>Animations</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Now, give this a name pendulum full swing.</p>
<h3 id="02Open-the-animator-tab-3"><a href="#02Open-the-animator-tab-3" class="headerlink" title="02Open the animator tab"></a>02Open the animator tab</h3><p>Now, open the animator tab, drag this pendulum swing animation to that panel, and double-tap the yellow-colored <strong>New</strong> <strong>Animation</strong> button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-13.JPG"
                      alt="double click new animation tab unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="03Create-an-animation-3"><a href="#03Create-an-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="03Create an animation"></a>03Create an animation</h3><p>With the game object selected, the animated metronome pendulum, in this case, we’d like to animate the X component of the rotation. So, you need to click Add <strong>Property</strong>&gt; <strong>Transform</strong>&gt; <strong>Rotation</strong> tab and click the + sign on its right, as shown below.</p>
<p>Now, click the plus sign automatically to set two keyframes, one at the beginning and one at the end. Now, click on end select all, and then delete for now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-15.JPG"
                      alt="delete keyframe unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-3"><a href="#04Add-keyframes-to-rotate-the-pendulum-3" class="headerlink" title="04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum"></a>04Add keyframes to rotate the pendulum</h3><p>With the first set of keyframes and the pendulum all way to the right, go halfway and change the rotation to the left on the left panel of Unity. Then, add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-16.JPG"
                      alt="change pendulum rotation unity"
                ></p>
<h3 id="05Slow-down-the-animation-3"><a href="#05Slow-down-the-animation-3" class="headerlink" title="05Slow down the animation"></a>05Slow down the animation</h3><p>As you can observe, the Animation of this pendulum is in a straight line and feels unnatural to the eyes. Thus, we’re required to smooth this Animation now! For this purpose, go to the <strong>Curves</strong>; you can see the pink properties of rotation as going from one side to another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/unity-stop-animation-17.JPG"
                      alt="click curves unity"
                ></p>
<p>Now, you need to adjust these pink curves. Start by adding a key to one of its sides, as shown below. After that, it is all on you how slow or fasts you want these values to be.</p>
<p>Here, you’re all done smoothing the animation in Unity after learning <strong>the stop-animation Unity</strong> tutorial.</p>
<p>You can even <strong>stop motion animation on Photoshop</strong> with the above tutorial.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Animate-Character-Design"><a href="#01Animate-Character-Design" class="headerlink" title="01Animate Character Design"></a>01Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are some steps involved in the designing a character for animation.

Different types serve different purposes and genres. So, let us know about the different types of animations, and this will help you understand which one would suit your requirements.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Pop-style Characters</strong></p>
<p>The characters you see in the comics and superhero animation movies are pop-style characters. They are highly expressive, become the centre of attraction and always are dominant on the screen. They tend to deliver an energy that reaches the audience impeccably.</p>

                      alt="pop style character"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Iconic design</strong></p>
<p>These characters are less fancy but highly expressive. They usually have a block face yet connect to an audience of all types. They are generally best for the corporate videos and those with some messages to be delivered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iconic design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Editorial Style Characters</strong></p>
<p>These characters are highly elegant and bold. These are characters that we see in different publications. They consist of great style, realisticity and cleanliness. They are mainly used to express the quality of presence.</p>

                      alt="editorial design"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sketch and experiment</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know about the different character types, it will help you understand which one would match the genre of animation you prefer to work on. So, start sketching your imagination in a draft.</p>
<p>Decide on the different poses your character might have. Track them down in a draft. It helps you become organised and put down your plan and creativity collectively.</p>
<p>Trial and error are one of the best ways to achieve perfection. So, it is crucial to sketch and then take feedback. If they do not appear praiseworthy, continue sketching and then get feedback again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animate and execute</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be best to execute all your drafts and imaginations. Try using the animation tools that suit your skill capacity and genre of animation the best.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Character-Design"><a href="#04Animate-Character-Design" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Character Design"></a>04Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are five simple steps that will help you animate a character design in 3D. The steps are as follows.</p>

<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rig-a-Simple-Character-Adobe-Animate-Tutorial-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial"></a>Part 1 How to Rig a Simple Character | Adobe Animate Tutorial</h2><p>Character rigging in Adobe is effortless and straightforward. There are a few steps for rigging in adobe animate, and we will be discussing and explaining the different steps that will help you learn rigging characters for your animation works.</p>
<p>The following are the steps to help you create a rig in Adobe animate.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step involves selecting the shape for rigging. Otherwise, you can also use bitmap on stage for it.</p>
<p>**Step 2:**Look for the “Asset warp tool” present in the tool panel. This tool will help you in the process of rigging.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-1.jpg"
                      alt="asset warp tool adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the first joint using the “Asset warp tool” by clicking on the image or the bitmap with the tool. You will see that a triangular mesh-like structure has been formed on your image or bitmap. And the part where you clicked on the image or the bitmap with the “Asset warp tool” forms the first joint.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-2.jpg"
                      alt="create joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The next step involves making more joints on the image and instilling bones between the joints. For that, go to the “Warp Options” and choose the “Tools” tab. There you will see the option of “Create bones”. Ensure to enable the “Create bones” option; otherwise, you will not create bones between the different joints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-3.jpg"
                      alt="add more joints adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the rig formation by joining all the joints correctly with each other with the help of the bones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-4.jpg"
                      alt="Complete the rig formation"
                ></p>
<p>The above steps would help you create the rig for the image or bitmap you want to animate. And now, the following steps will help you learn the steps for modifying the rig as well as tweening.</p>
<p>The first process for it is deformation. So, the following are the steps that help you perform the process of deformation in animation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You need to deform the mesh, and you can do so by holding and dragging the joint with the help of the “Asset warp tool”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-5.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 7:**You can also rotate a bone by clicking and dragging the bone you want to rotate when you drag a joint, the size of the joint changes, which is not the case when you drag a bone. Its size remains constant.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/adobe-animate-riggings-proper-tutorial-for-you-6.jpg"
                      alt="hold and drag joint adobe animate 2"
                ></p>
<p>Now, we will help you learn to work with the different keyframes. The keyframes enable the image or the bitmap to acquire different poses, vital for animation. The “Edit Multiple Frames” mode helps you work with different keyframes.</p>
<p>You can readily create new keyframes and deform the image through joints or bones. Each keyframe retains its own set, and you can integrate different transforms after setting one pose for the image in the keyframe.</p>

And as we know, there are two major and most renowned types of it. One is the 2-dimensional animation, which we know as the animation. And the other one is 3-dimensional, better known as animation.</p>
<p>Now, there are different aspects that are essential for anyone aspiring to animate, whether in or 3D, to know. One of the aspects is designing characters for animation. And we have ideally put forth a discussion about the different factors you need to know about character designing in and animation.</p>
<h3 id="01Animate-Character-Design-3"><a href="#01Animate-Character-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="01Animate Character Design"></a>01Animate Character Design</h3><p>There are some steps involved in the designing a character for animation. And those steps are pretty diverse. So, we have enlisted all the required steps and factors to help you learn and understand character designing for animation. The list is as follows.</p>
<h3 id="02Understanding-your-audience-3"><a href="#02Understanding-your-audience-3" class="headerlink" title="02Understanding your audience"></a>02Understanding your audience</h3><p>To create the best character design, it is essential that you understand your target audience. If your target audience includes the kids and the children, your character design will primarily be based on cartoons.</p>
<p>Ensure which genre of animation does your audience prefer? If it is funny or mythological or any other genre, you design your characters accordingly.</p>
