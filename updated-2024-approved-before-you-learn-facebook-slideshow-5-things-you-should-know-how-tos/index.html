Addressing the concern of image transformation methods to <strong>turn a photo into a cartoon Photoshop</strong>, let us dive into some of the most affordable methods of creating cartoonized photos in the aforesaid editing application.</p>
<p>Talking of the most basic Photoshop tools for creating caricature images, you can start your editing spree with using the Graphic Tablet, Brush Tool, Layer Masks and a graphic pen to create amateur cartoonized edits from your still photographs, getting a full control on image tracing.</p>
<h3 id="01Brush-Tool"><a href="#01Brush-Tool" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images. You can alternatively cater to the job with a trackpad, mouse, or even your hand. It is however, difficult to assure steady hand postures for image tracing, lest you are using a stylus pen.</p>
<h3 id="03Pen-Tool"><a href="#03Pen-Tool" class="headerlink" title="03Pen Tool"></a>03Pen Tool</h3><p>Using the Pen Tool for cartoonizing your portrait, allows you to draw outlines along the desired figure within the image, along with its important elements, so that you can easily use these outlined paths to introduce different color blocks.</p>
<p>Similar to the Brush Tool, the Photoshop Pen utility grants you the freedom to vary the degree of detailing in your cartoon edit, from being highly expressive to only remaining around the shore. Working with the Pen Tool can, however be a bit tiring and time taking, with respect to the extent of detailing you wish to add to the caricature edits.</p>
<p>Additional to the aforementioned tools, you can also consider using the default image filters of the Photoshop application to get comparable results. This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

<h3 id="01Brush-Tool-1"><a href="#01Brush-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="01Brush Tool"></a>01Brush Tool</h3><p>A few usage examples include working with a combination of the graphic tablet pen and the editor brushes to trace your image, using the brush in a masked or a fresh layer to avoid altering the actual image, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="02Graphic-Tablet-1"><a href="#02Graphic-Tablet-1" class="headerlink" title="02Graphic Tablet"></a>02Graphic Tablet</h3><p>It is best to use the Photoshop Graphic Tablet for adhering to the concern of tracing cartoonized images.

This is an exclusively better option to choose, compared to the Pen Tool, when you are working without a Graphic Tablet. To get over the top realistic caricature renderings, you will need to supplement the use of Photoshop filters with the application’s editing channels and other adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create High End Cartoonized Look</strong></p>
<p>The following tutorial is a stepwise explanation of the process to <strong>convert photo into cartoon Photoshop</strong> in the easiest possible way. Stick to the method for getting affordable results in a quick span.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Launch the Program</strong></p>
<p>Visit the official website of Photoshop Image Editor for a free download of the software program in your system, followed by installing and launching the same in your device.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Your Image</strong></p>
<p>On a successful launch of the editor program, you will be directed to the ‘Photoshop Editor’ window, where you are required to upload any desired still image from your device for creating a cartoonized edit. To do this, either simply add your image to the editor workspace using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method, or navigate to the ‘File’ tab in the top toolbar and click on ‘Open’ in the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Edge Enhancement</strong></p>
<p>Once your image appears in the editor timeline, proceed to sharpen the edges of the face and body of the portrait. Start with navigating to and clicking on the ‘Filter’ option, followed by tapping on ‘Filter Gallery’ and selecting the ‘Artistic’ folder, where you need to choose the ‘Poster Edges’ option. Observe the effect of these setting on the portrait and make necessary changes.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Setting</strong></p>
<p>Ensure that the background and foreground of your image are set to white and black colors respectively. If not, proceed to adjust the same as required.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Distorting the Edges</strong></p>
<p>You now need to introduce some distortion in the edges of your portrait. Navigate to the ‘Filter’ option again, open the ‘Filter Gallery’ and choose ‘Torn Edges’ from the menu that drops down. Select the desired parameter values in accordance with your creative suitability.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Using the Channels Panel</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to select and copy your portrait using the ‘Ctrl + A’ and Ctrl + C commands respectively. Navigate to the ‘Channels’ panel at the right of the Photoshop workspace. At the panel’s bottom right, proceed with creating a new channel. It will be assigned the name ‘Alpha 1’ by Photoshop, which you are most welcome to change.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Color Inversion</strong></p>
<p>When you finish creating the channel, use the ‘Ctrl + V’ command to paste your portrait in the same. Proceed with inverting the image colors by navigating to the ‘Image’ option, followed by choosing the ‘Adjustment’ and ‘Invert’ options from the consecutive drop downs. Now, make a selection of the ‘White’ regions of your portrait by pressing the ‘Ctrl’ key and clicking on the ‘Alpha 1 Channel thumbnail.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Layer Creation</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel at the right of the Photoshop workspace, and click on the ‘New Layer’ icon for creating a fresh layer. Fill the just created layer with black color, either by pressing ‘g’ from your system’s keyboard, or using the ‘Paint Bucket’ tool. Don’t forget to assign a suitable name to the layer.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Image Editor- Creating the ‘Black’ Layer"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat the above process to create a separate layer and e fill the same with white color. The layer creation process is essential to separate the white and black colors of the actual image.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Image Editor- Creating the ‘White’ Layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10: Layer Dragging</strong></p>
<p>In the ‘Layers’ panel, drag the ‘Black’ layer above the ‘White’ one.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Creating Additional Layers</strong></p>
<p>You are now required to create three more layers, with the same process as for the above two, for adding effects to the Skin, Clothes and Teeth&#x2F;Eyes of the portrait. When you finish creation, assign suitable names to the layers, followed by dragging them below the ‘Black’ one within the ‘Layers’ panel.</p>

                      alt="&quot;Photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12: Color Selection and Application</strong></p>
<p>Choose the respective colors for the clothes, skin and teeth&#x2F;eyes of the cartoonized edit. To proceed with color application, navigate to the toolbar at the left of the Photoshop workspace and choose the ‘Brush Tool’. Finally, choose a particular layer and apply careful brush strokes to add color to the specific area of the portrait that you wish to edit. Follow the same process to add colors to the remaining layers to get the desired result in all areas of your cartoonized edit.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Image Editor- Color Selection and Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13: Using the Gradient Tool</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel again and create a new ‘Gradient’ layer to further enhance your creation. You now need to select the ‘Gradient Tool’ from the toolbar at the left of the Photoshop workspace. The ‘Gradient Editor’ pops up with the continuously running ‘Gradient Bar’, as soon as you make the selection. Double click on the gradient boxes at both ends to select them, followed by making your color choices. Tap on ‘OK’ when you are satisfied with your work.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Image Editor- Using the ‘Gradient’ Tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 14: Filling the Gradients</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with gradient filling, press and hold the mouse button on the image at the bottom left and continue to drag the cursor to its top right corner. Leave the mouse and navigate to the ‘Layers’ panel for dragging and dropping the ‘Gradient’ layer above the ‘White’ layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Image Editor- Filling the Gradients"
                ></p>
<p>You are now done with the process of creating a caricature edit from a normal still portrait. Your final image output will appear something like the following:</p>

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Blackboard-Animation-Outdated" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Is Blackboard Animation Outdated?</strong></h2><p><strong>Blackboard animation</strong> some may say is as outdated as the concept of ‘blackboards’ themselves. After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2. Create a Storyboard"></a>02<strong>Step 2. Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

<h3 id="03Step-3-Draw-Characters"><a href="#03Step-3-Draw-Characters" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Draw Characters"></a>03<strong>Step 3. Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

Put Together Project</strong></h3><p>Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That’s also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go</p>
<p>In the image below, we’re only showing the start of a potential project. We’ve only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video</p>

<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-4"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-4" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more.

<p>Yes, it is definitely possible In fact, it couldn’t be easier. A lot of the ‘whiteboard animation’ generators also work as <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators.</p>
<p>In this guide, we hope to shed some light on the subject so that everyone can have an easier time approaching the matter of creating a blackboard project on their own.</p>

After all, nowadays, whiteboards are the standard for presenting information in a school setting — with many preferring the ease of using dry-erase markers over the more unwieldy chalk.</p>
<p>However, unlike the inconveniences of using an actual chalkboard, <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is not so different from whiteboard animation In fact, it’s just given a different look. One that may be exactly what you’re looking for — especially if you’re looking to get in touch with the older generation (who would no doubt be more familiar with the concept.)</p>

Well, that’s easy really. You’ll need images Or, rather, you’ll need visuals outside of just the plain text that is usually associated with <strong>chalkboard animation</strong>.</p>
<p>With the right kind of visuals to go along with your informational text, you can boost the effectiveness of your <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> and make it more palatable. Perfectly in line with the modern needs of the era.</p>

We’ve also decided to choose a more ‘custom’ method, rather than using one of the premium <strong>blackboard animation</strong> generators (which usually require you to pay a steep price in order to gain access to a media library.)</p>
<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-1"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first.

<h3 id="01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-3"><a href="#01Step-1-Pick-Your-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="01Step 1. Pick Your Software"></a>01Step 1. Pick Your Software</h3><p>The first step in creating <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> is to pick the software that you want to use This can be something more ‘animation-specific’, like After Effects. Or something more ‘video-editing-specific’ like Filmora.</p>
<p>Again, because this is meant to be more of a ‘general’ tutorial, we won’t be showing you exactly how to use whatever editing software you decide to use in order to create your <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos. But, as a general kind of advice, it would be best that you pick a video editor like <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> that offers a Timeline feature that will allow you to quickly put together a project</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard-3"><a href="#02Step-2-Create-a-Storyboard-3" class="headerlink" title="02Step 2. Create a Storyboard"></a>02<strong>Step 2. Create a Storyboard</strong></h3><p>Next, to make the actual <strong>blackboard animation</strong> creation process go smoother, it’s important that you create a storyboard that will outline the video that you want to create</p>
<p>The more detailed this storyboard is, the better Although, of course, you don’t necessarily have to draw every single frame of your <strong>chalkboard animation</strong> beforehand. Just sketch out the general idea. It will help make sure that you won’t have to rush about making all sorts of corrections in the future</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="03Step-3-Draw-Characters-3"><a href="#03Step-3-Draw-Characters-3" class="headerlink" title="03Step 3. Draw Characters"></a>03<strong>Step 3. Draw Characters</strong></h3><p>For this step, we say ‘characters’ and use the word ‘draw.’ But really, this is a very open kind of step where we encourage you to put together all media that you will need to make your project into a reality This is where the storyboard really helps. After all, with that, you have an idea of exactly what kind of characters, settings, music, audio, etc. you’ll need for each scene (if not each frame)</p>
<p>If you’re not the ‘drawing’ type, by the way, there are both FREE and premium media libraries that you can take advantage of to use for your project It might be difficult to find matching art styles at first. But, if you’re really particular about that, then you can always find a freelance digital artist to design with a specific style in mind</p>

<h3 id="04Step-4-Put-Together-Project-3"><a href="#04Step-4-Put-Together-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="04Step 4. Put Together Project"></a>04<strong>Step 4. Put Together Project</strong></h3><p>Last of all, of course, is the process of putting everything together. Do you have your software? Great Launch it and create a new project Do you have your storyboard? That’s also great Now you have an idea where each character and setting will go</p>
<p>In the image below, we’re only showing the start of a potential project. We’ve only added one image to the timeline But, as you can see, with the use of Filmora, even this one image can be turned into a video</p>

<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-7"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-7" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Blackboards are naturally associated with learning This makes <strong>blackboard animation</strong> videos a great method of sharing information with an audience. Whether you’re doing it to promote your services&#x2F;goods or just genuinely looking to impart knowledge to another</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Some may think that blackboards are outdated — for the mere fact that blackboards themselves are considered outdated when compared to whiteboards — but that doesn’t make them any less effective at getting a message across so long as you include the right kind of visuals</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In our brief ‘overview’ tutorial, we expand on the subject of <strong>blackboard animation</strong> some more. Be warned, it’s not the kind of project you should go into if you’re not prepared for the work Longer projects, especially, will require quite a bit of elbow grease to get done.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Still, there’s something satisfying about a well-done <strong>chalkboard animation video</strong> that will not only be a joy to create but also, hopefully, catch the attention of your audience as well.</p>
