<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to sharpen the picture by 50%. This is available in the picture corrections effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, copy the image and paste it back as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Repeat these steps four times to make the lines in the image stand out sharply.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, add the color effect of Black and White at 20%.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You will get quite a fairly detailed output.</p>

You can then use the picture effects, and other tools present in PowerPoint as mentioned to get your output.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If the target picture has a background, your first step is to isolate it from its background. Remove the background or make it white.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to sharpen the picture by 50%. This is available in the picture corrections effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, copy the image and paste it back as a picture.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Repeat these steps four times to make the lines in the image stand out sharply.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the end, add the color effect of Black and White at 20%.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You will get quite a fairly detailed output.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

Fred Flinstone is the protagonist of the famous American sitcom show Yabba-Dabba-Dinosaurs and the entire franchise. The Flinstone is another show that features Fred with his family. Of course, the show’s main attraction is the Flinstone family and the way this show is set. This show is set in a way that romanticizes a family living in a cave.

Dexter is mostly seen wearing a white lab coat and semi-circle goggles, like someone who is always working in a lab. Imagining Dexter as a skeleton can be hilarious.

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                      alt="draw arms skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

The other protagonists are Blossom and Buttercup, her sisters. The Bubble is named Bubble because she is the bubbliest and most fun-loving among the three sisters. Bubble is a sweet little girl with a round face and big round eyes and short limbs. These characteristics in this character make it look cuter. But to think, how would we imagine Bubble in a skeleton version. This is how Bubble would look like a skeleton.</p>

You can use a <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong> to add a quirky effect to your project. You can draw an animated skeleton on your favorite t-shirt and change the vibe of the t-shirt. There are many methods to draw <strong>skeleton cartoon</strong>. Here we focus mainly on one way to draw cartoon skeleton. The method might seem difficult at the beginning, but the whole process becomes easier and smooth once you start following the steps. The steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To start with the drawing of the skeleton, let’s start with the head or the skull. The head should be round, and the jaw area needs to be at some angle or angular and have smaller lines than the long rounded lines on the upper part of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The mouth of the skull must be open, and then we need to concentrate on other features of the face like the teeth, nose, and cheekbone.</p>

                      alt="start with head skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After the head is complete, we focus on the neck and the chest area. To draw the neck, divide the neck into small sections to show the division in the neck portion, as shown in the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To start with the rib cage, we need to draw the spine. The spine can be drawn as a long thick line and should be a continuity of the neck, so the neck and the spine should be drawn in the same way and same line. It is to be drawn at the body’s center, just below the head. You can refer to the example as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you have drawn the spine, to draw the rib, draw circles around the spine as if the curved lines demonstrating the rib are revolving around the spine.</p>

                      alt="draw ribs skeleton cartoon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After the head and the chest region is complete. Focus on the hand. You can rest the arms any way you want. Since you are a beginner, this example shows the easiest ways to rest the hands when you are drawing a cartoon skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> The left arm will rest on the hips, and the right arm needs to be shown in a way so that it looks that the skeleton body is leaning on some object.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Since the arms have divisions, the bones must be drawn the same way shown in the example with the same divisions on the arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Keep in mind that both the arms must have equal bone divisions; otherwise, the drawing may look weird.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Now you need to draw the hand. The hand is made of small bones. To draw the hand, divide it into small sections consisting of very small bones.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> After the hands are complete, the upper part of the body is complete. Now we need to focus on the lower part of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To start with the lower part of the body, we start with the hip portion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Show the hips with curved lines, and draw a round-like shape inside the curve to show the holes in the hips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> After the hip is complete, start with the upper half of the legs. Draw a long bone from the hip to demonstrate the upper part of the leg.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now we need to concentrate on the other half of the leg. You can position the legs any way you want. Here in the example, the left leg will be crossed over the right leg.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> After the lower half of the legs is complete, the standing posture of the skeleton is set.</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Now we need to add the feet at the end of the leg. The feet are made of tiny pieces of bones; to draw the feet, divide them into small sections, as shown in the example.</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Draw the feet in a similar way to how you have drawn the hands.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-10-Best-Text-Motion-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-10-Best-Text-Motion-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 10 Best Text Motion After Effects"></a>Part 2 <strong>10 Best Text Motion After Effects</strong></h2><p>Alright, now let’s move on to our promised <strong>Text Motion Graphics After Effects</strong> and <strong>Text Motion Graphics Premiere Pro</strong> templates. We’ve tried our best to pick a variety out for you so that you can have a good selection to choose from! You should also take the time to explore the different platforms where these templates are offered in case you end up needing a different look!</p>
<h3 id="01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#01Clean-and-Elegant-Corporate-Identity-–-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="01Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>01<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/clean-and-elegant-corporate-identity-text-reveal-m-LNZBKE4?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity – Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>The first on this list is the ‘Clean and Elegant Corporate Identity — Text Reveal’ by Mogrt. The title is quite explanatory in and of itself, but just in case you’re confused, it’s a template that was designed for professionals and brands to establish their corporate identity. The font is very modern in design, and it comes with several flare variations so that the reveal works out in the way that you want it to.</p>
<p>Other aspects, like the shadow blur, opacity, particle size (for the reveal), and text glossiness are also adjustable and can be changed at will based on your standards.</p>
<h3 id="02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title"><a href="#02Multipurpose-Clean-3D-Text-to-Title" class="headerlink" title="02Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title"></a>02<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-to-title-mogrt-GBY4SJA?_ga=2.106613187.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title</strong></a></h3><p>The next <strong>text motion</strong> template is the ‘Multipurpose Clean 3D Text to Title’ also created by Mogrt. This one is <strong>text motion graphics</strong> that you can use for <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> and, with proper customization, and be used for just about anything that you want! It’s a very multi-purpose kind of graphic, one that you can maybe sneak in as an advert or for announcing celebrations or anniversaries!</p>
<p>As a final note, if you want to use this graphic as <strong>text motion</strong> for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://1.envato.market/multipurpose-clean-3d-text-title-mogrt" >after effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it is available for that as well!</p>
<h3 id="03Simple-Motion-Text-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#03Simple-Motion-Text-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="03Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro"></a>03<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/simple-motion-text-premiere-pro-GBTX88N?_ga=2.13864439.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Simple Motion Text | Premiere Pro</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘Simple Motion Text’ graphic, is one that is available for both Premiere Pro and After Effects (though the link we’ve provided is for the Premiere Pro version!) As the name implies, the animation is quite simple, which may be exactly what you want, in any case. It certainly makes it very versatile (especially as you can change font style and color as you will). Making it the perfect template for a beginner that’s just starting out and doesn’t want anything too complicated.</p>
<h3 id="0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt"><a href="#0430-Glitch-Text-Presets-For-Premiere-Pro-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="0430 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt"></a>04<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/30-glitch-text-presets-for-premiere-pro-mogrt-CAMGZUK?_ga=2.77311317.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>30 Glitch Text Presets For Premiere Pro | Mogrt</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, the ‘30 Glitch Text Presets’ by Mogrt is a Premiere Pro exclusive! It’s also quite fun in its particulars. As a template, it’s not as versatile as the one that we introduced previously, since the ‘glitch’ effect gives off quite the unique vibes, but that doesn’t make it any less potent at catching the eyes of your audience!</p>
<p>The best part, in this case, is that it comes with 30 pre-sets, all with fitting glitch sound effects (included in the pack) that you can use. Of course, there are other customization functions as well, including font style, color, transparency, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT"><a href="#05Comic-Bubbles-MOGRT" class="headerlink" title="05Comic Bubbles MOGRT"></a>05<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/comic-bubbles-mogrt-F7RGDBH?_ga=2.69380432.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Comic Bubbles MOGRT</strong></a></h3><p>Again, this next templated, called ‘Comic Bubbles’, kind of has its own unique vibe, making it inflexible in some ways but also more fun if that’s the kind of look that you’re looking for. Which, in this case, are literal ‘Comic’ text bubbles, like you would see in your old 90s comic (loud, pop-y, and with lots of bright colors!) The only difference from that to this is that these comic text bubbles move, allowing you to create ‘punchy’ text in between animated projects.</p>
<p>For your reference, there are 80 different comic bubbles included in the pack. All of which are easy to customize and will allow you to adjust colors, text, and transition effects (have a look at the video that we’ve linked if you want to see it in action!)</p>
<h3 id="06Smoke-To-Text-Reveal-Mogrt"><a href="#06Smoke-To-Text-Reveal-Mogrt" class="headerlink" title="06Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)"></a>06<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/smoke-to-text-reveal-mogrt-7JZWR45?_ga=2.102885568.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Smoke To Text Reveal (Mogrt)</strong></a></h3><p>This next template, ‘Smoke to Text Reveal’ is another one that serves a very particular need. To help with visualization, the <strong>text motion graphics</strong> are at first obscured by smoke before it bubbles up into a crisp, modern text reveal! It’s perfect for those looking for underwater-themed <strong>text motion graphics</strong>. Or those who want to serve a hint of mystery with the smoke effect.</p>
<p>This is <strong>Text Motion Graphics - Premiere Pro</strong>. And the best part about it is that you can customize the text and the background at will — allowing you to truly make the template your own and make the most out of the smoke-to-reveal effect.</p>
<h3 id="07Text-Messages-Toolkit"><a href="#07Text-Messages-Toolkit" class="headerlink" title="07Text Messages Toolkit"></a>07<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/text-messages-toolkit-R6YBA2M?_ga=2.110661189.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Text Messages Toolkit</strong></a></h3><p>Want to appeal to the Gen Z audience? Then, the ‘text messages toolkit’ might be a fun <strong>text motion graphics</strong> for you to try. As you can perhaps surmise from the name, it’s a template that you can use in order to create ‘text message’ interactions. It’s customizable too! You can change the text box color, size, transparency, and just have a ball pimping it out of that’s what you want.</p>
<h3 id="08Large-Text-Title-Block"><a href="#08Large-Text-Title-Block" class="headerlink" title="08Large Text Title Block"></a>08<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mixkit.co/free-premiere-pro-templates/large-text-title-block-14/"><strong>Large Text Title Block</strong></a></h3><p>With the ‘large text title block’ template, you have the flexibility of the naturally more modern and minimalistic design, allowing you to use it for a wide variety of different projects. It works especially well for advertisements, if you’re wondering about potential uses, or as transition graphics between text to video!</p>
<h3 id="09Blueprint-Titles"><a href="#09Blueprint-Titles" class="headerlink" title="09Blueprint Titles"></a>09<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://elements.envato.com/blueprint-titles-4Z9BFN8?_ga=2.43224421.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Blueprint Titles</strong></a></h3><p>Want something that’s a little quirkier? Or, perhaps, instructional? Then the ‘Blueprint Titles’ template is one that you can consider. As you can perhaps guess from the name, it allows you to create <strong>text motion graphics</strong> in a style that is similar to the kind of blueprints you usually see when working with design or architecture.</p>
<h3 id="10Dynamic-Minimalism"><a href="#10Dynamic-Minimalism" class="headerlink" title="10Dynamic Minimalism"></a>10<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://videohive.net/item/dynamic-minimalism-essential-graphics-mogrt/21637324?s_rank=16&_ga=2.111208772.1125999308.1642156437-697849157.1641902481"><strong>Dynamic Minimalism</strong></a></h3><p>Sometimes, simple really is best!

Claymators mold them into their desired characters using painstaking efforts, patience and team work. First, a miniature skeleton is made to fit the clay around. On top of that goes a latex layer. Then the Claymation artist moves the models into required position following the storyline or script. <strong>Clay animation</strong> not only uses clay, sometimes it involves wires and armatures for smoother movement of the characters. Moreover, artists have to be concerned about fingerprints and dirt marks all the time. At times, plastic made or fabric made accessories is brought into play to give the figurines a realistic look. Detailing is the most difficult and important part for enhancing your clay character and film.</p>

Here is a list of some of the most memorable Claymation flicks.</p>

<p>The British stop-motion comedy franchise which had 5 installation had been a first of its kind. The characters Wallace and Gromit later inspired their own movie “Wallace and Gromit – The Curse of the Were-Rabbit” which was released back in 20by Dreamworks Animation. The mystery solving duo ran a pest control company while Wallace experiments on a brain washing gadget for dissuading wild rabbits which leads to its own disaster. This movie has a classic appeal amongst children an adults alike.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Directed by Time Burton, this film is one that impresses us all every time. The success of this Claymation is embedded in the fact that it made creepy gothic characters look appealing. It has a mixture of both the Halloween and Christmas theme. The character Jack Skellington goes through a magic door to arrive at ‘Christmas Town’. Using Claymation was an excellent choice for the script as it enabled the animators to bring about that distorted movements that evolved into a gorgeous visual storytelling.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.</p>
<h3 id="05Coraline-2009-2"><a href="#05Coraline-2009-2" class="headerlink" title="05Coraline (2009)"></a>05Coraline (2009)</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Here’s where Tim Burton establishes his cult following. The film Caroline was based the novel by Neil Gaiman. The story is about the weird adventures of a girl named ‘Caroline’ and a button eyed rag doll who she meets after travelling through a portal. Laika Studios made the appeal of the film as beautiful yet unsettling. It harbors plenty of dark and creepy aspects like by many followers of this type of fiction.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are dozen animated films that were way ahead of their time and were discontinued as the medium was seen more to be specifically directed for children only. Tim Burton’s creation ‘Frankenweenie’ was considered a ‘love letter’ to the Golden Age of Horror films. It was considered too dark for the average viewer so the director was later let go by Disney.</p>

                ></p>
<p>A more somber attempt at stop motion films was Paranorman. It featured printed faces in the characters which needed a new and innovative creative approach. People experienced ground breaking characterization of an openly gay character in the film which was a milestone in terms of mainstream animated films. Films like ‘Paranorman’ perfectly depicts the entry of modern film making software like ****<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>** and Maya in stop motion animations.</p>

<p>From the makers of Paranorman, Boxtrolls all introduces an innovative approach to using clay models in films. Featuring Ben Kingsley, Simon Peggs and Richard Ayoade, Boxtrolls is probably the very few box office hits on this list. The film first premiered at the Venice Film Festival the same year of its release.</p>

<p>Directed by Time Burton, this film is one that impresses us all every time. The success of this Claymation is embedded in the fact that it made creepy gothic characters look appealing. It has a mixture of both the Halloween and Christmas theme. The character Jack Skellington goes through a magic door to arrive at ‘Christmas Town’. Using Claymation was an excellent choice for the script as it enabled the animators to bring about that distorted movements that evolved into a gorgeous visual storytelling.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Popular claymation give credit to Chicken Run for its amazing dramatization of fiction. For the first time ever a stop motion film had a cast as amazing as Chicken Run; starring Mel Gibson and Timothy Spall. The film was a collaboration amongst elite production studios like Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation. The story is a spoof of the 19film ‘The Great Escape’.</p>

                      alt="corpse bride"
                ></p>
<p>The Corpse Bride is probably the second Tim Burton film on our list. The director seems to have a special preference for the stop motion genre. When you combine that with an amazing musical script and charming but relatable ghoulish characters, the flick becomes an absolute delight.</p>

                      alt="coraline"
                ></p>
<p>Here’s where Tim Burton establishes his cult following. The film Caroline was based the novel by Neil Gaiman. The story is about the weird adventures of a girl named ‘Caroline’ and a button eyed rag doll who she meets after travelling through a portal. Laika Studios made the appeal of the film as beautiful yet unsettling. It harbors plenty of dark and creepy aspects like by many followers of this type of fiction.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are dozen animated films that were way ahead of their time and were discontinued as the medium was seen more to be specifically directed for children only. Tim Burton’s creation ‘Frankenweenie’ was considered a ‘love letter’ to the Golden Age of Horror films. It was considered too dark for the average viewer so the director was later let go by Disney.</p>

                      alt="paranorman"
                ></p>
<p>A more somber attempt at stop motion films was Paranorman. It featured printed faces in the characters which needed a new and innovative creative approach. People experienced ground breaking characterization of an openly gay character in the film which was a milestone in terms of mainstream animated films. Films like ‘Paranorman’ perfectly depicts the entry of modern film making software like ****<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>** and Maya in stop motion animations.</p>

<p>From the makers of Paranorman, Boxtrolls all introduces an innovative approach to using clay models in films. Featuring Ben Kingsley, Simon Peggs and Richard Ayoade, Boxtrolls is probably the very few box office hits on this list. The film first premiered at the Venice Film Festival the same year of its release.</p>
