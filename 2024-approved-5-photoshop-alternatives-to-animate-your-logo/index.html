<h2 id="How-to-Create-Your-Video"><a href="#How-to-Create-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Your Video"></a>How to Create Your Video</h2><p>Step1 The first step to creating your whiteboard animation video is to <strong>know your topic of choice</strong>. Determining your choice topic is based on the purpose of the video. You have to know the reason why the video is being created in the first place to enable you decide the contents, the outlook, the font style and size and the colors to use.</p>
<p>Step2 The next step after you’ve getting your topic is execution of the idea. This involves having a script which usually involves the step-by-step procedure you are to follow to achieve your goal. Writing the script is arguable the most difficult process. However, once you get it right, all the other processes become relatively easy to execute. You might need to employ a professional script writer depending on your budget for the project.</p>
<p>Step3 After that, the next thing is to deicide whether or not to use your own voice or computer voice. This is also called a voice over. Most software provides a text to speech voice over option which usually comes with various alternatives. There is also another option of using your own voice to finish the project.</p>
<p>Step4 Add text, graphics and animation. This step is usually easier when you are working with the script already provided. You include the text, animations, figures, etc. sometimes you might need to import additional resources to complete this task. However, not all software provides for this.</p>
<p>Step5 Organize your work. In organizing your work, you must ensure that you voice over matches properly with what is on display. Check your spellings, grammar, composition and other ‘little’ details that may give your work a bad look.</p>
<p>Step6 Save your work and export. Once your done with your work, you have to save it on your local disk. This also means downloading the work from the website or software onto a local disk. You can now share the video on any social media of your choice. The most popular place to share it is on YouTube which is the most widely used video watching application.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-8"><a href="#In-this-article-8" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>
<p>| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| ——————- | ————————————————————————————————————————- | ————————————————————————————————————————————— |<br>| <strong>About</strong>           | It is a game engine that enables you in creating human-machine interfaces, AR simulations, customize splash screens, etc. | It is a computer graphics software that is open source and is mainly used for creating 3D models.                                       |<br>| <strong>Types Supported</strong> | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| <strong>Best Purpose</strong>    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |</p>
<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>

The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation"><a href="#Step-1Installation" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<p>Animation is one such aspect that is formed from the integration of several varied factors and processes. One of the most vital ones is the process of rigging. Thus, we will be discussing <strong>Unity character rigging</strong> as Unity is one of the most efficient platforms for animation.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will introduce you to one of the best tools you can use to edit videos and nurture the creative skills you carry in yourself. So, without any further delay, let us start our discussion.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-9"><a href="#In-this-article-9" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Unity Rigging?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Is It Better to Rig in Unity or Blender?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Unity-Rigging-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?"></a>Part 1 What is Unity Rigging?</h2><p>To understand what <strong>Unity rigging</strong> is, we must start our discussion first by discussing rigging in animation. In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>

<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>

The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-1"><a href="#Step-1Installation-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-1"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

In animation, rigging is the process in which your animation characters are separated into two parts. One is the mesh-like structure of the characters. And the other is the skeletal structure given to the characters.</p>
<p>You integrate bones and joints and join them accordingly in the characters present in your animation. It is similar to the presence of the human skeletal system. Moreover, just like the skeletal system in humans helps in the movements of the different parts of the body, the bone and joint structure through rigging also enables the characters in animation to move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that rigging is the process by which you can enable your characters’ in animation to move and show different facial expressions, etc. So, it is obvious that without the process of rigging, the animation is impossible, which makes rigging one of the most crucial aspects of animation.</p>
<p>Now that we know what rigging in animation is, we will be discussing what is <strong>animation rigging in Unity</strong>. Unity technologies have developed a cross-platform gaming engine called ‘Unity’. And this platform also offers the ones interested in animation to learn animation rigging.</p>
<p>The Unity platform offers robust and effective tools for animation rigging. And these tools assist the animators to create real-time rigs in Unity. Most commonly, the set of tools in Unity for rigging is used on the characters. But, if one likes, they can also use the tools on ani Game Object that includes animations and skeletons.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you utilise the platform of Unity or the toolsets of Unity to perform rigging in animation, it can be referred to as <strong>unity rigging</strong>. It is one of the most powerful and renowned platforms for animation, creating the finest and most professional animation creations.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>

<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-2"><a href="#Step-1Installation-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-2"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-2"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

A common question arises as to whether one should choose <strong>blender rigging over Unity</strong> or vice versa. We have laid down the following table to compare the different features of Blender with that of Unity.</p>
<p>| |  Unity            | Blender                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| ——————- | ————————————————————————————————————————- | ————————————————————————————————————————————— |<br>| <strong>About</strong>           | It is a game engine that enables you in creating human-machine interfaces, AR simulations, customize splash screens, etc. | It is a computer graphics software that is open source and is mainly used for creating 3D models.                                       |<br>| <strong>Types Supported</strong> | Supports 3D                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                         |<br>| <strong>Best Purpose</strong>    | Ideal for film, architecture, automotive, transportation, and other industries                                            | Ideal for animation and design that assists in VFX, simulation, organizations of all sizes with rendering, modeling, and video editing. |</p>
<p>There are many features that Blender lacks, but Unity includes. The features included in Unity but are absent in Blender are as follows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Drawing</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Games</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In-Game Analytics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Multi-player Gaming Network</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Player Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Virtual Reality</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> IT Asset Management</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Prototype Creation</p>
<p>Therefore, it is preferred to opt for <strong>Unity rigging</strong> than Blender rigging, as Blender lacks a considerable number of features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Use-Animation-Rigging-In-Unity-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity"></a>Part 3 How To Use Animation Rigging In Unity</h2><p>Now, we will be introducing you to the different steps that will help you in <strong>unity rig animation</strong>. The following list includes the steps in the sequence that, when you deploy, will help you rig in the platform of Unity.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1Installation-3"><a href="#Step-1Installation-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Installation"></a>Step 1Installation</h5><p>The first step is to install the “<strong>animation rigging package” of Unity</strong>. You will get the animation rigging package in the “Package Manager”. You will be able to avail of this animation package in Unity 2019.1 and above.</p>
<p>This package offers you a library that consists of rig constraints. And this library of rig constraints enables you to create procedural motion during the runtime. And the general term used for this is called “runtime rigging”.</p>
<p>The “Asset’s Animator Root” consist of the “Rig Builder Component”, which is the source where the rigs are accumulated. The rigs here are the constraints put together in groups. With these steps you will be able to create <strong>Unity humanoid rig</strong> that will make your animation creations look the finest, most realistic and most professional.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-3"><a href="#Step-2Rig-Builder-set-up-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2Rig Builder set-up"></a>Step 2Rig Builder set-up</h5><p>After installing the <strong>unity animation rigging package</strong>, the next step is to set up the rig builder. You will have to use the “Animator component” in this step. Using the “Animator component”, integrate the “Rig Builder component” with the “GameObject”. Generally, in the hierarchy of rig, it is the topmost “Transform”.</p>
<p>Then, you will have to make a new child GameObject. To which, you will have to integrate the “Rig component”. After this step, you need to access the “Animator root”, where you will find the “Rig Builder component”. In the “Rig Builder component”, you need to assign the “Rig to the Rig Layers” list.</p>
<p>It will complete the task of creating the most basic rig. The further steps will help you install the required behaviours in the character or characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3Bone-Rendering-3"><a href="#Step-3Bone-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3Bone Rendering"></a>Step 3Bone Rendering</h5><p>Whether it is <strong>unity rigging</strong> or 3D, bone rendering is the most crucial step to enable your animation characters to gain movement. The “Unity Editor” will help you interact and work with the character’s skeleton in the “Scene view.”</p>
<p>You can add “Transform” lists and then display them in various visual styles with the help of the “Bone Renderer: component. It enables you to integrate numerous “Bone Renderer” components, each of them having its unique style of display. As a result, gameplay debugging, rig setup, keyframing, and other artist workflows are facilitated.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-3"><a href="#Step-5Managing-the-Rig-Constraints-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints"></a>Step 5Managing the Rig Constraints</h5><p>Your characters gain “runtime animation” through the rig constraints, and thus, these are the building blocks facilitating assembling the rigs. The rigs are combined in multiple and varied ways to obtain the desired motions and movements in the characters.</p>

The logo should be capable enough of explaining your website’s understanding about the field.

Research suggested that about 99 percent of brands use video marketing in order to enhance their brand image. Starting of your video with an animated logo will not just look catchy but also make the video all the more professional.</p>
<h3 id="02They-can-make-great-outros-3"><a href="#02They-can-make-great-outros-3" class="headerlink" title="02They can make great outros"></a>02They can make great outros</h3><p>Just like animated videos can serve as amazing introductory bits of the video, they can also be the perfect outros to videos. If you haven’t added your animated logo in the introduction of the video then they can be added at the end. This will lead to your viewers remembering your brand for a longer time.</p>
<h3 id="03Look-very-attractive-at-trade-shows-3"><a href="#03Look-very-attractive-at-trade-shows-3" class="headerlink" title="03Look very attractive at trade shows"></a>03Look very attractive at trade shows</h3><p>Trade shows are opportunities where websites and company owners can interact with investors and potential customers face to face. It’s an excellent opportunity to make your mark on the big stage. Logos of companies may be projected on the big screen in such events. At such events when you have just a few seconds to make a mark, you need your logo to grab the viewer’s attention. Hence, animated logos could be very useful.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-6-of-the-Best-Animated-Logos-3"><a href="#Part-3-6-of-the-Best-Animated-Logos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 6 of the Best Animated Logos"></a>Part 3 6 of the Best Animated Logos</h2><h3 id="01Mastercard-3"><a href="#01Mastercard-3" class="headerlink" title="01Mastercard"></a>01Mastercard</h3><p>Mastercard is one of the first companies to use animated logos. The logo is simply fantastic due to the meaning it conveys without any complex animation. The animated logo involves the traditional venn diagram logo of mastercard morphing into several objects. These objects include everything from food to groceries to luxurious products. It basically includes the various kinds of commodities people buy using mastercards.</p>
<h3 id="02Burger-king-3"><a href="#02Burger-king-3" class="headerlink" title="02Burger king"></a>02Burger king</h3><p>Another popular brand that uses animated logos is the american fast food giant, burger king. The logo is not highly flashy like we see in mastercard. However, the animated logo does obviously look more attention seeking than the conventional static logo. The logo shows the stacking of the different elements of the logo one by one over each other. This resembles the process of making a burger.</p>
<h3 id="03Fedex-3"><a href="#03Fedex-3" class="headerlink" title="03Fedex"></a>03Fedex</h3><p>Another logo that would classify as a flashy animated logo is the fedex logo. Initially, fedex had experimented with several logos before sticking to the arrow logo which continues even today. The animated logo involves an arrow making the letter “Fedex” with its trajectory and then finally settling in between letters X and E. The logistics giant delivers couriers from one corner of the world to another, and the arrow symbolizes exactly that!</p>
<h3 id="04Flickr-3"><a href="#04Flickr-3" class="headerlink" title="04Flickr"></a>04Flickr</h3><p>Flickr is a popular stock image and video hosting platform. Anyone can use the stock images and videos in their content. The logo starts with a blue and pink dot initially. These dots later expand in a whirlpool like motion. The logo starts off with the static logo before it expands. The idea is to show that the online stock image portal goes beyond limits and has every picture and video you’d need</p>
<h3 id="05Bundle-3"><a href="#05Bundle-3" class="headerlink" title="05Bundle"></a>05Bundle</h3><p>Bundle is a popular app that offers its users rewards upon shopping from selected stores. These stores have an alliance with bundle and upon shopping from them, users seek reward points on the bundle app. The animated logo starts of with a pink screen which later converges to become a large “B” wrapped with a gifting ribbon. Although, the logo is pretty simple it does an amazing job at explaining the brand’s MSP and attracts customers.</p>
<h3 id="06Google-3"><a href="#06Google-3" class="headerlink" title="06Google"></a>06Google</h3><p>The logo of google has evolved over the years. Google is almost synonymous to attractive logos and it comes up with attractive new logos every now and then.
