Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>

Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>

<p>You can proceed to include the image zoom and camera pan features within your project by clicking on the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option.

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>

Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>

<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>

Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

<p>You can proceed to include the image zoom and camera pan features within your project by clicking on the ‘Pan &amp; Zoom’ option.

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>Step 4: Add Transitions to Eliminate Hard Cuts</strong></p>
<p>The smooth play of a slideshow is often distorted by hard cuts, which can be escaped by applying smooth transition effects to the slides. Consider exploring the ‘Transitions’ tab of Filmora to choose from a diversity of easily customizable transition effects and place them at the intersection point of the respective slides in the project timeline.</p>
<p>Instead of applying the same transition to every slide, prefer choosing the one that exclusively suits the content arrangement and flow within particular slides. This would save your slideshow from getting a repetitive look.</p>

Play durations can alternatively be customised in the project timeline by dragging the slider in a left or right direction.</p>

<p>To enhance the thematic appeal of your slideshow, consider desaturating the colours of the included images with the extensive range of visual effects and overlays available in the ‘Effects’ tab of the software’s editing timeline. Opening the tab, you are exposed to a series of ‘Filter and Overlay’ categories, that have further subdivisions of Light Leaks, Sepia Tone and Lomography.</p>
<p>To add a particular effect, place it in the timeline track above the desired clip or image. Observe the changes in the ‘Preview Panel’ and proceed to adjust the effect settings if required, by double clicking on the particular effect.</p>

                ></p>

                ></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the music tracks, place them one by one on the project timeline and move ahead with adjusting their play durations.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Export Your Creation</strong></p>
<p>When you are satisfied with your work, you can export the slideshow directly from Filmora to a number of media sharing platforms. All you need to do is, navigate to and tap the ‘Export’ button in the top right corner of the editor screen and proceed to set the resolution and frame rate, and select the output file format of your created slideshow in the ‘Export Window’ that appears.</p>

<p>Here are a few steps to follow for making <strong>whiteboard animation videos</strong> in Filmora and Camtasia:</p>
<h3 id="01Write-a-Script"><a href="#01Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="01Write a Script"></a>01Write a Script</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="scripting a story 5"
                ></p>
<p>Much like a standard video or a brief skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video succeeds. It is excellent to have compelling images and information, but without a logical story, they’re nothing.</p>
<p>It is not a blog, storyboard, or a collection of bullet points. You hope for a proper script, which says everything about the video. Why? Because then you’ll know precisely what images should be added further in specific segments, what the narrator must show, and what transitions are necessary.</p>
<h3 id="02Start-with-the-Storyboard"><a href="#02Start-with-the-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02Start with the Storyboard"></a>02Start with the Storyboard</h3><p><img

                      alt="preparing a storyboard 6"
                ></p>
<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>
<h3 id="03Create-Images"><a href="#03Create-Images" class="headerlink" title="03Create Images"></a>03Create Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Create images"
                ></p>
<p>You may find this part very easy if you’re a precise person. It’s all about crafting fun and unique images that will help deliver the data you want to bring across. Attempt to create striking photos which will excite your audience. The simpler, more distinctive, and attractive you’ll be able to make those images, the higher your end product.</p>
<h3 id="04Animate-Those-Images"><a href="#04Animate-Those-Images" class="headerlink" title="04Animate Those Images"></a>04Animate Those Images</h3><p><img

                      alt="Animate images"
                ></p>
<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>
<h3 id="05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio"><a href="#05Record-and-Sync-the-Audio" class="headerlink" title="05Record and Sync the Audio"></a>05Record and Sync the Audio</h3><p><img

                      alt="Record and sync the audio"
                ></p>
<p>The audio is arguably one of the main essential parts of a <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>. So, before recording the audio for any part of your project, practice reading through your script several times until you recognize it by memory and cannot struggle when speaking into the microphone during the particular recording process.</p>
<p>The final step involves getting your audio. Every animated video must have narration because it helps to elucidate what’s happening within the images that folks are seeing. Record your audio, and ensure it’s perfectly in sync with your content.</p>
<p> So, whether you are going with <strong>hand whiteboard animation</strong> and then modifying and animated with Filmora or the <strong>Camtasia whiteboard animation,</strong> both result in good whiteboard animation. Whereas, if looking for comprehensive video editing tools, the obvious choice will be Filmora.</p>

<p>Now you have got a script, and you’ve got a clear idea of how you want your video to return across. It’s time to start out building the storyboard. With a storyboard, you may be able to sort out your thoughts far better. You’ll see how each frame comes onto the screen, and a unit of ammunition ties into the opposite.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you may have a simple idea about how your final product will look. If there is some alteration you’re not proud of, this can be the instant where you’ll make changes.</p>

<p>With your images drawn and in situ on the storyboard, it’s time to animate them. When animating your <strong>whiteboard animation video</strong>, confine in mind that every frame will likely show for no. quite seconds. This forces you to form every single movement count – with only some seconds per frame available, and quick movements are often preferable to extended scenes of stillness.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3"><a href="#Part-1：What-is-Whiteboard-Animation-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?"></a>Part 1：What is Whiteboard Animation Video?</h2><p>To understand the whiteboard animation video, we must go back to the beginning. Think about how professors illustrate different topics and equations using a whiteboard. They will write down the important words or formulas and then expand on that information through their lecture.</p>
<p>Whiteboard animation is taking those words, phrases and images to another level. Whiteboard animation is a series of events or videos that are created using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >2D animation software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. These videos can be showcased in any type of setting. You can upload them onto a social media site, show them as part of a presentation, or add them to a crowdfunding or product funding page.</p>
<p>When someone watches a whiteboard animation video, they see the series of images and graphics in sequential order, and there is usually a narration accompanying those images. These videos can be short, anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds. The idea is to deliver information in a clear, coherent and concise way.</p>
<p>To create whiteboard animation, the goal is to take complex concepts and information, and make it easy to understand. Now we can go into some detail about how to create a whiteboard video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2：How-to-Create-Whiteboard-Animation-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?"></a>Part 2：How to Create Whiteboard Animation Videos?</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Write-a-Script-3"><a href="#Step-1-Write-a-Script-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Write a Script"></a>Step 1: Write a Script</h4><p>Much like a normal video or a short skit, there must be a script if a whiteboard animation video is to succeed. Having interesting images and information is great, but they are nothing without a coherent story.</p>
<p>It is not a blog post, storyboard or a set of bullet points. What you need is a proper script, which says everything in regards to the video. Why? Because then you will know precisely what images should be added in certain sections, what the narrator must say, and what transitions are necessary.</p>

You have a clear idea of how you want your video to come across. It is time to start creating the storyboard. With a storyboard, you will be able to organize your thoughts much better. You can see how each frame comes onto the screen, and how one shot ties into the other.</p>
<p>When you create your storyboard, you will have a good idea about how your final product will look. If there are some transitions you are not happy with, this is the moment where you can make changes.</p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-10-Photo-Animator-Templates-to-Bring-Your-Images-to-Life"><a href="#02Best-10-Photo-Animator-Templates-to-Bring-Your-Images-to-Life" class="headerlink" title="02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life"></a>02Best 10 Photo Animator Templates to Bring Your Images to Life</h3><p><strong>3D motion photo animator</strong></p>
<p>The first tool on the list of <strong>3d photo animators online</strong>is an excellent tool called 3D motion photo Animator. The tool helps to split landscape shots into numerous panels depending on the distance of the object from the camera. Furthermore, the plug-in also adds a soft parallax movement into the layers, giving the final image a beautiful 3D effect. The tool also has several editing options and a wide range of lens flare.

Moreover, you can also add depth to the animated image to enhance the 3 dimensional effects and make it appear more realistic.</p>
<p><strong>Live photo animation</strong></p>
<p>Live photo animation is another seamless tool that offers <strong>free 3d motion graphics</strong>. The tool which is mainly meant for animation gives you the ability to mask the object and a keyframe from vivid natural movements. Once the subject and the background have been isolated and processed, they work independently from each other. This means that, due to independent operation, live photo animation becomes even more realistic since the subject can be animated without affecting the background. The tool also has cool zooming and 3D tracking effects.</p>
<p><strong>Easy 3D face photo Animator</strong></p>

Animation with Adobe is one of the most convenient ways of animation. Here is how you can convert any 2D image to a 3D animated image using adobe. For those of you who are used to animating with adobe, it must be simple to follow the few steps listed below:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Firstly, you need to convert the 2D layers of the still image to 3D postcards (planes that possess 3D properties). In case the layer you are starting with is a text layer, any transparency will be retained.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now to convert the object into 3D, wrap the 2D layer around any 3D object such as cube, cone, or sphere. Choose the shape that suits your layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to create a 3D mesh from greyscale information in a 2D image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Now you need to simulate a metalworking technique called “Repousse”. By doing so, you will be extruding a 2D object in a 3D space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Next, you need to build a 3D volume from any multi-frame file like DICOM. Photoshop automatically converts the individual slices of the file into a 3D object that can be manipulated in 3D space from any angle. Furthermore, if you wish to optimize the display, you can also apply any 3D volume render effects.</p>

Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute.

Later on, the makers removed the adorable pig to allow Moana to strive more independently. However, this indeed came with many critics from fans as Pua was just too sweet and cute. As much as Pua’s role in the film was small, he still made a lot of impressions.</p>
